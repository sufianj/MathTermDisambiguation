Definition:Argument of Complex Number,Argument,"Let z = x + i y be a complex number.

An argument of z, or z, is formally defined as a solution to the pair of equations:
:(1):    x | z | = cos(   ) z
:(2):    y | z | = sin(   ) z
where | z | is the modulus of z.

From Sine and Cosine are Periodic on Reals, it follows that if θ is an argument of z, then so is θ + 2 k π where k ∈ℤ is any integer.


Thus, the argument of a complex number z is a continuous multifunction.

 


=== Principal Range ===
It is understood that the argument of a complex number z is unique only up to multiples of 2 k π.

With this understanding, we can limit the choice of what θ can be for any given z by requiring that θ lie in some half open interval of length 2 π.

The most usual of these are:
:[ 0  . . )2 π
:( -π . . ]π

but in theory any such interval may be used.

This interval is known as the principal range.

=== Principal Argument ===
Let R be the principal range of the complex numbers ℂ.

The unique value of θ in R is known as the principal argument, of z.

This is denoted Arg( z ).

Note the capital A.

The standard practice is for R to be ( -π . . ]π.

This ensures that the principal argument is continuous on the real axis for positive numbers.

Thus, if z is represented in the complex plane, the principal argument Arg( z ) is intuitively defined as the angle which z yields with the real (y = 0) axis.


 "
Definition:Logical Argument,Argument,"A logical argument (or just argument) is a process of creating a new statement from one or more existing statements.

An argument proceeds from a set of premises to a conclusion, by means of logical implication, via a procedure called logical inference.


An argument may have more than one premise, but only one conclusion.


While statements may be classified as either true or false, an argument may be classified as either valid or invalid.


Loosely speaking, a valid argument is one that leads unshakeably from true statements to other true statements, whereas an invalid argument is one that can lead you to, for example, a false statement from one which is true.


Thus:
:An argument may be valid, even though its premises are false.
:An argument may be invalid, even though its premises are true.
:An argument may be invalid and its premises false.

It is even possible for the conclusion of an argument to be true, even though the argument is invalid and its premises are false.


To be sure of the truth of a conclusion, it is necessary to make sure both that the premises are true and that the argument is valid.


However, while you may not actually know whether a statement is true or not, you can investigate the consequences of it being either true or false, and see what effect that has on the truth value of the proposition(s) of which it is a part. That, in short, is what the process of logical argument consists of.


An argument may be described symbolically by means of sequents, which specify the flow of an argument.


=== Finitary Argument ===
A finitary argument is a logical argument which starts with a finite number of axioms, and can be translated into a finite number of statements."
Definition:Preimage/Mapping/Element,Argument,"Let f: S → T be a mapping.

Let f^-1⊆ T × S be the inverse of f, defined as:

:f^-1 = {( t, s ): f (   )s = t }


Every s ∈ S such that f (   )s = t is called a preimage of t.


The preimage of an element t ∈ T is defined as:

:f^-1(   )t := { s ∈ S: f (   )s = t }


This can also be expressed as:
:f^-1(   )t := { s ∈Img( f^-1): ( t, s ) ∈ f^-1}


That is, the preimage of t under f is the image of t under f^-1."
Definition:Independent Variable,Argument,"=== Real Function ===
Let f: ℝ→ℝ be a real function.

Let f (   )x = y.

Then x is referred to as an independent variable.

=== Complex Function ===

Definition:Polar Coordinates/Angular Coordinate,Argument,"Let P be a point in a system of polar coordinates where O is the pole.

Definition:Functor,Arrow,"Informally, a functor is a morphism of categories.

It may be described as what one must define in order to define a natural transformation.

=== Covariant Functor ===
Let 𝐂 and 𝐃 be metacategories.


A covariant functor F: 𝐂→𝐃 consists of:

* An object functor F_0 that assigns to each object X of 𝐂 an object FX of 𝐃.

* An arrow functor F_1 that assigns to each arrow f: X → Y of 𝐂 an arrow Ff : FX → FY of 𝐃.


These functors must satisfy, for any morphisms X  f ⟶ Y  g ⟶ Z in 𝐂:

:F (   )g ∘ f = F g ∘ F f
and:
:F (   )id_X = id_F X

where id_W denotes the identity arrow on an object W, and ∘ is the composition of morphisms.

=== Definition 1 ===
Let 𝐂 and 𝐃 be metacategories.


A contravariant functor F : 𝐂→𝐃 consists of:

* An object functor F_0 that assigns to each object X of 𝐂 an object FX of 𝐃.

* An arrow functor F_1 that assigns to each arrow f : X → Y of 𝐂 an arrow Ff : FY → FX of 𝐃.


These functors must satisfy, for any morphisms X  f ⟶ Y  g ⟶ Z in 𝐂:

:F (   )g ∘ f = F f ∘ F g
and:
:F (   )id_X = id_F X

where:
:id_W denotes the identity arrow on an object W
and:
:∘ is the composition of morphisms.

=== Definition 2 ===

Definition:Morphism Category,Arrow,"Let 𝐂 be a metacategory.

Definition:Complementary Angles,Complement,":

Let ∠ BAC be a right angle.

Let ∠ BAD + ∠ DAC = ∠ BAC.

That is:
:∠ DAC = ∠ BAC - ∠ BAD


Then ∠ DAC is the complement of ∠ BAD.


Hence, for any angle α (whether less than a right angle or not), the complement of α is π 2 - α.

Measured in degrees, the complement of α is 90^∘ - α.


If α is the complement of β, then it follows that β is the complement of α.

Hence we can say that α and β are complementary.


It can be seen from this that the complement of an angle greater than a right angle is negative.


Thus complementary angles are two angles whose measures add up to the measure of a right angle.

That is, their measurements add up to 90 degrees or π 2 radians."

In the above digraph, the vertices are v_1, v_2, v_3 and v_4.


=== Arc ===
Let G = ( V, E ) be a digraph.

The arcs are the elements of E.

Informally, an arc is a line that joins one vertex to another.


If e ∈ E is an arc joining the vertex u to the vertex v, it is denoted u v.


=== Endvertex ===
Let D = ( V, E ) be a digraph.

Let e = u v be an arc of D, that is, e ∈ E.


The endvertices of e are the vertices u and v.


=== Initial Vertex ===
Let D = ( V, E ) be a digraph.

Let e = u v be an arc of D, that is, e ∈ E.


The initial vertex of e is the endvertex u which e is incident from.

=== Final Vertex ===
Let D = ( V, E ) be a digraph.

Let e = u v be an arc of D, that is, e ∈ E.


The final vertex of e is the endvertex v which e is incident to.

In the above graph, the arcs are v_1 v_2, v_2 v_4, v_4 v_3, v_4 v_1 and v_1 v_4.


As can be seen, in this general definition it is allowable for an arc to go in both directions between a given pair of vertices.


=== Formal Definition ===



A directed graph or digraph D is a non-empty set V together with an antireflexive relation E on V.

The elements of E are the arcs.


Thus the above digraph can be defined as:

:D = ( V, E ):
::V = { v_1, v_2, v_3, v_4 }
::E = {( v_1, v_2 ), ( v_2, v_4 ), ( v_4, v_3 ), ( v_4, v_1 ), ( v_1, v_4 )  }

=== Symmetric Digraph ===
Let D = ( V, E ) be a digraph such that the relation E in D is symmetric.

Then D is called a symmetric digraph.


It follows from the definition of a (simple) graph that a symmetric digraph is in fact the same thing as an undirected graph.

=== Simple Digraph ===
Let D = ( V, E ) be a digraph.

If the relation E in D is also specifically asymmetric, then D is called a simple digraph.

That is, in a simple digraph there are no pairs of arcs (like there are between v_1 and v_4 in the diagram above) which go in both directions between two vertices."

Let ℛ⊆ S × T be a relation.

The domain of ℛ is defined and denoted as:
:Dom( ℛ) := { s ∈ S: ∃ t ∈ T: ( s, t ) ∈ℛ}


That is, it is the same as what is defined here as the preimage of ℛ.


=== General Definition ===
Let ∏_i  = 1^n S_i be the cartesian product of sets S_1 to S_n.

Let ∘: S × S → T be a binary operation.

The domain of ∘ is the set S and can be denoted Dom( ∘).

:s = ⌊ x ⌋, the floor of x
:it is not the case that there exists m ∈ℕ such that d_M = 9 for all M ≥ m.
(That is, the sequence of digits does not end with an infinite sequence of 9s.)


=== Decimal Point ===
Let x ∈ℝ have a decimal expansion:

Definition:Basis Expansion,Expansion,"=== Positive Real Numbers ===
Let x ∈ℝ be a real number such that x ≥ 0.

Let b ∈ℕ: b ≥ 2.


Let us define the recursive sequence:
:∀ n ∈ℕ: n ≥ 1: ⟨ f_n ⟩ = 
b ( x - ⌊ x ⌋)     : n = 1 

b ( f_n - 1 - ⌊ f_n - 1⌋)     : n > 1

Then we define:
:∀ n ∈ℕ: n ≥ 1: ⟨ d_n ⟩ = ⌊ f_n ⌋


It follows from the method of construction and the definition of the floor function that:

:∀ n: 0 ≤ f_n < b and hence ∀ n: 0 ≤ d_n ≤ b - 1
:∀ n: f_n = 0  f_n + 1 = 0 and hence d_n + 1 = 0.


Hence we can express x = ⌊ x ⌋ + ∑_j ≥ 1d_j/b^j as:
:[ s  d_1 d_2 d_3 …]_b
where:
:s = ⌊ x ⌋
:it is not the case that there exists m ∈ℕ such that d_M = b - 1 for all M ≥ m.

Definition:Set Intersection,Intersection,"Let S and T be sets.


The (set) intersection of S and T is written S ∩ T.

It means the set which consists of all the elements which are contained in both of S and T:

:x ∈ S ∩ T  x ∈ S  x ∈ T

or, more formally:

:A = S ∩ T ∀ z: ( z ∈ A  z ∈ S  z ∈ T )


We can write:

:S ∩ T := { x: x ∈ S  x ∈ T }

and can voice it S intersect T.


It can be seen that, in this form, ∩ is a binary operation which acts on sets.


One often says that two sets intersect  if and only if  they have non-empty intersection.


=== Set of Sets ===
Let S be a set of sets.

The intersection of S is:

Then the intersection of ⟨ S_i ⟩ is defined as:

:⋂_i ∈ I S_i := { x: ∀ i ∈ I: x ∈ S_i }


=== In the context of the Universal Set ===

In treatments of set theory in which the concept of the universal set is recognised, this can be expressed as follows.

Let 𝕌 be a universal set.

Let I be an indexing set.

Let ⟨ S_i ⟩_i ∈ I be an indexed family of subsets of 𝕌.


Then the intersection of ⟨ S_i ⟩ is defined and denoted as:

:⋂_i ∈ I S_i := { x ∈𝕌: ∀ i ∈ I: x ∈ S_i }

=== Subsets of General Set ===
This definition is the same when the universal set 𝕌 is replaced by any set X, which may or may not be a universal set:

Let I be an indexing set.

Let ⟨ S_i ⟩_i ∈ I be an indexed family of subsets of a set X.


Then the intersection of ⟨ S_i ⟩ is defined as:

:⋂_i ∈ I S_i := { x ∈ X: ∃ i ∈ I: x ∈ S_i }
where i is a bound variable.

=== Countable Intersection ===
Let 𝕊 be a set of sets.

Let ⟨ S_n ⟩_n ∈ℕ be a sequence in 𝕊.

Let S be the intersection of ⟨ S_n ⟩_n ∈ℕ:
:S = ⋂_n ∈ℕ S_n


Then S is a countable intersection of sets in 𝕊.

=== Finite Intersection ===
Let S = S_1 ∩ S_2 ∩…∩ S_n.

Then:
:S = ⋂_i ∈ℕ^*_n S_i := { x: ∀ i ∈ℕ^*_n: x ∈ S_i }

If it is clear from the context that i ∈ℕ^*_n, we can also write ⋂_ℕ^*_n S_i."

Definition:Power (Algebra),Involution,"=== Natural Numbers ===
Let ℕ denote the natural numbers.


For each m ∈ℕ, recursively define e_m: ℕ→ℕ to be the mapping:
:e_m (   )n =  1     : n = 0 
 m × e_m (   )x     : n = x + 1
where:
:+ denotes natural number addition.
:× denotes natural number multiplication.


e_m (   )n is then expressed as a binary operation in the form:
:m^n := e_m (   )n

and is called m to the power of n.

=== Integers ===
Let x ∈ℝ be a real number.

Let n ∈ℤ be an integer.

The expression x^n is called x to the power of n.

x^n is defined recursively as:


:x^n =  1     : n = 0 
   
 x × x^n - 1    : n > 0 
   
x^n + 1 x     : n < 0

where x^n + 1 x denotes division.


=== Even Power ===

=== Rational Numbers ===
Let x ∈ℝ be a real number such that x > 0.

Let m ∈ℤ be an integer.

Let y = √(x) be the mth root of x.


Then we can write y = x^1/m which means the same thing as y = √(x).


Thus we can define the power to a positive rational number:

Let r =  p q ∈ℚ be a positive rational number where p ∈ℤ_≥ 0, q ∈ℤ_> 0.

Then x^r is defined as:
:x^r = x^p/q = ( √(x))^p = √(( x^p ) )


When r = -p q ∈ℚ: r < 0 we define:
:x^r = x^-p/q =  1 x^p/q
analogously for the negative integer definition.

=== Real Numbers ===
Let x ∈ℝ_>0 be a (strictly) positive real number.

Let r ∈ℝ be a real number.


We define x^r as:

:x^r := exp(   )r ln x
where exp denotes the exponential function.


This definition is an extension of the definition for rational r.

This follows from Logarithms of Powers and Exponential of Natural Logarithm: it can be seen that:
:∀ r ∈ℚ: exp(   )r ln x = exp(   )ln(   )x^r = x^r

 

=== Complex Numbers ===
Let z, k ∈ℂ be complex numbers.


z to the power of k is defined as the multifunction:

:z^k := e^k ln( z )

where:
:e^z is the exponential function
:ln is the  natural logarithm multifunction.


=== Principal Branch ===
The principal branch of a complex number raised to a complex power is defined as:

:z^k = e^k Ln z

where Ln z is the principal branch of the natural logarithm.


=== Positive Real Base ===
Let t > 0 be a real number and let k be a complex number.


The principal branch of a positive real number raised to a complex power is defined as:

:t^k = e^k ln t

where ln is the natural logarithm of a positive real number.

Category:Definitions/Analysis

=== Power of Zero ===
Let r ∈ℝ be a real number.

(This includes the situation where r ∈ℤ or r ∈ℚ.)

When x=0, x^r is defined as follows:

:0^r =  1     : r = 0 
 0     : r > 0 
Undefined    : r < 0

This takes account of the awkward case 0^0: it is ""generally accepted"" that 0^0 = 1 as this convention agrees with certain general results which would otherwise need a special case."

When ≼_1 and ≼_2 are well-orderings, the condition on the order preservation can be relaxed:

Let ϕ: S → T be a bijection such that ϕ: S → T is order-preserving:
:∀ x, y ∈ S: x ≼_1 y ϕ(   )x ≼_2 ϕ(   )y

Circle knots can often be quite wild and unwieldy - most of modern knot theory concerns itself with a specific kind of knot.

These knots are described as a finite set of points in ℝ^3 called { x_1, x_2, …, x_n }, together with line segments from x_i to x_i + 1 and a line segment from x_n to x_1.

The union of all these line segments is clearly a circle knot, or an unknot, an embedding of the circle which is homotopic to a circle.

Definition:Argument of Complex Number/Principal Range,Principal,"It is understood that the argument of a complex number z is unique only up to multiples of 2 k π.

With this understanding, we can limit the choice of what θ can be for any given z by requiring that θ lie in some half open interval of length 2 π.

The most usual of these are:

This interval is known as the principal range."

The unique value of θ in R is known as the principal argument, of z.

The standard practice is for R to be ( -π . . ]π.

This ensures that the principal argument is continuous on the real axis for positive numbers.

Thus, if z is represented in the complex plane, the principal argument Arg( z ) is intuitively defined as the angle which z yields with the real (y = 0) axis.

=== Definition by Index ===
Let ( S, ×) be an algebraic structure where the operation × is an operation derived from, or arising from, the multiplication operation on the natural numbers.

Let ( a_1, a_2, …, a_n ) ∈ S^n be an ordered n-tuple in S.


The composite is called the continued product of ( a_1, a_2, …, a_n ), and is written:

:∏_j  = 1^n a_j = ( a_1 × a_2 ×⋯× a_n )

=== Definition by Inequality ===
Let ( S, ×) be an algebraic structure where the operation × is an operation derived from, or arising from, the multiplication operation on the natural numbers.

Let ( a_1, a_2, …, a_n ) ∈ S^n be an ordered n-tuple in S.


The continued product of ( a_1, a_2, …, a_n ) can be written:
:∏_1 ≤ j ≤ n a_j = ( a_1 × a_2 ×⋯× a_n )

=== Definition by Propositional Function ===
Let ( S, ×) be an algebraic structure where the operation × is an operation derived from, or arising from, the multiplication operation on the natural numbers.

Let ( a_1, a_2, …, a_n ) ∈ S^n be an ordered n-tuple in S.


Let R (   )j be a propositional function of j.

Then we can write:

:∏_R (   )j a_j =  the product of all a_j such that R (   )j holds.


If more than one propositional function is written under the product sign, they must all hold.


Such an operation on an ordered tuple is known as a continued product.


Note that the definition by inequality form 1 ≤ j ≤ n is a special case of such a propositional function.

Also note that the definition by index form ∏_j  = 1^n is merely another way of writing ∏_1 ≤ j ≤ n.

Hence all instances of a continued product can be expressed in terms of a propositional function.


=== Iverson's Convention ===
Let ∏_R (   )j a_j be the continued product over all a_j such that j satisfies R.


This can also be expressed:
:∏_j ∈ℤ a_j^[ R (   )j ]
where [ R (   )j ] is Iverson's convention."
Definition:Cartesian Product,Product,"Let S and T be sets.


The cartesian product S × T of S and T is the set of ordered pairs ( x, y ) with x ∈ S and y ∈ T:

:S × T = {( x, y ): x ∈ S  y ∈ T }


Another way of defining it is by:

:( x, y ) ∈ S × T  x ∈ S, y ∈ T

More specifically:
:∀ p: ( p ∈ S × T ∃ x: ∃ y: x ∈ S  y ∈ T  p = ( x, y )  )


S × T can be voiced S cross T.


=== Class Theory ===
Let A and B be classes.


The cartesian product A × B of A and B is the class of ordered pairs ( x, y ) with x ∈ A and y ∈ B:

:A × B = {( x, y ): x ∈ A  y ∈ B }


Thus:
:∀ p: ( p ∈ A × B ∃ x: ∃ y: x ∈ A  y ∈ B  p = ( x, y )  )


A × B can be voiced A cross B.

=== Finite Cartesian Product ===
Let ⟨ S_n ⟩ be a sequence of sets. 

The (finite) cartesian product of ⟨ S_n ⟩ is defined as:

:∏_k  = 1^n S_k = {( x_1, x_2, …, x_n ): ∀ k ∈ℕ^*_n: x_k ∈ S_k }


It is also denoted S_1 × S_2 ×⋯× S_n.

Thus S_1 × S_2 ×⋯× S_n is the set of all ordered n-tuples ( x_1, x_2, …, x_n ) with x_k ∈ S_k.


In particular:
:∏_k  = 1^2 S_k = S_1 × S_2

=== Countable Cartesian Product ===

The same notation can be used to define the (countable) cartesian product of an infinite sequence:

Let ⟨ S_n ⟩_n ∈ℕ be an infinite sequence of sets. 

The cartesian product of ⟨ S_n ⟩ is defined as:

:∏_k  = 1^∞ S_k = {( x_1, x_2, …, x_n, …): ∀ k ∈ℕ: x_k ∈ S_k }


It defines the concept:
:S_1 × S_2 ×⋯× S_n ×⋯

Thus ∏_k  = 1^∞ S_k is the set of all infinite sequences ( x_1, x_2, …, x_n, …) with x_k ∈ S_k.

=== Family of Sets ===
Let I be an indexing set.

Let ⟨ S_i ⟩_i ∈ I be a family of sets indexed by I.

The cartesian product of ⟨ S_i ⟩_i ∈ I is the set of all families ⟨ s_i ⟩_i ∈ I with s_i ∈ S_i for each i ∈ I.


This can be denoted ∏_i ∈ I S_i or, if I is understood, ∏_i S_i."

When considering Hilbert spaces, one wants to deal with projections onto subspaces.

These projections however require the linear subspace to be closed in topological sense in order to be well-defined.

Let P be the point on C in the first quadrant such that θ is the angle made by OP with the x-axis.

:S^n =  S:     n = 1

Select a point P on the plane different from O.

Construct an infinite straight line through O and P and call it the x-axis.


Identify the x-axis with the real number line such that:
:0 is identified with the origin O
:1 is identified with the point P

The orientation of the x-axis is determined by the relative positions of O and P.

It is conventional to locate P to the right of O, so as to arrange that:

:to the right of the origin, the numbers on the x-axis are positive
:to the left of the origin, the numbers on the x-axis are negative.


Construct an infinite straight line through O perpendicular to the x-axis and call it the y-axis.

Identify the point P' on the y-axis such that OP' = OP.

Identify the y-axis with the real number line such that:
:0 is identified with the origin O
:1 is identified with the point P'


The orientation of the y-axis is determined by the position of P' relative to O.

It is conventional to locate P' such that, if one were to imagine being positioned at O and facing along the x-axis towards P, then P' is on the left. 

Hence with the conventional orientation of the x-axis as horizontal and increasing to the right:

:going vertically ""up"" the page or screen from the origin, the numbers on the y-axis are positive
:going vertically ""down"" the page or screen from the origin, the numbers on the y-axis are negative.

If Q is in the positive direction along the real number line that is the y-axis, then y is positive.

If Q is in the negative direction along the real number line that is the y-axis, then y is negative.

The cartesian 3rd power of S is:

:S^3 = S × S × S = {( x_1, x_2, x_3 ): x_1, x_2, x_3 ∈ S }

Let:
:∑_R (   )j a_j
be an instance of a summation on { a_1, a_2, …, a_n }.


The set of elements { a_j ∈ S: 1 ≤ j ≤ n, R (   )j } is called the summand.

=== Definition by Inequality ===
Let ( S, + ) be an algebraic structure where the operation + is an operation derived from, or arising from, the addition operation on the natural numbers.

Let ( a_1, a_2, …, a_n ) ∈ S^n be an ordered n-tuple in S.


The summation of ( a_1, a_2, …, a_n ) can be written:
:∑_1 ≤ j ≤ n a_j = ( a_1 + a_2 + ⋯ + a_n )


=== Multiple Indices ===
Let ∑_0 ≤ j ≤ n a_j denote the summation of ( a_0, a_1, a_2, …, a_n ).


Summands with multiple indices can be denoted by propositional functions in several variables, for example:

:∑_0 ≤ i ≤ n( ∑_0 ≤ j ≤ n a_i j) = ∑_0 ≤ i, j ≤ n a_i j


:∑_0 ≤ i ≤ n( ∑_0 ≤ j ≤ i a_i j) = ∑_0 ≤ j ≤ i ≤ n a_i j

=== Definition by Propositional Function ===
Let ( S, + ) be an algebraic structure where the operation + is an operation derived from, or arising from, the addition operation on the natural numbers.

Let ( a_1, a_2, …, a_n ) ∈ S^n be an ordered n-tuple in S.


Let R (   )j be a propositional function of j.

Then we can write the summation as:

:∑_R (   )j a_j =  The sum of all a_j such that R (   )j holds.


If more than one propositional function is written under the summation sign, they must all hold.


Such an operation on an ordered tuple is known as a summation.


Note that the definition by inequality form 1 ≤ j ≤ n is a special case of such a propositional function.

Also note that the definition by index form ∑_j  = 1^n is merely another way of writing ∑_1 ≤ j ≤ n.

Hence all instances of a summation can be expressed in terms of a propositional function.


=== Iverson's Convention ===
Let ∑_R (   )j a_j be the summation over all a_j such that j satisfies R.


This can also be expressed:
:∑_j ∈ℤ a_j [ R (   )j ]
where [ R (   )j ] is Iverson's convention.

=== Iverson's Convention ===
Let ∑_R (   )j a_j be the summation over all a_j such that j satisfies R.


This can also be expressed:
:∑_j ∈ℤ a_j [ R (   )j ]
where [ R (   )j ] is Iverson's convention.

:∑_g ∈ F g = ∑_i  = 1^n e_i

Take the indexed supremum:

Suppose that there are no values of j for which Φ(   )j is true.

Then sup_Φ(   )j a_j is defined as being -∞.

This supremum is called a vacuous supremum.


This is because:
:∀ a ∈ℝ: sup{ a, -∞} = a

Hence for all j for which Φ(   )j is false, the supremum is unaffected.


In this context -∞ is considered as minus infinity, the hypothetical quantity that has the property:

:


At 59 the pattern stops, and the number 60 is represented by the digit 1 once again.

Thus these groupings were placed side by side:

:the one to the left of that would indicate a number from 60 × 1 to 60 × 59
and so on, each grouping further to the left indicating another multiplication by 60


For fractional numbers there was no actual radix point. Instead, the distinction was inferred by context.


The fact that they had no symbol to indicate the zero digit means that this was not a true positional number system as such.

If all the premises of a valid argument are true, then the conclusion must also therefore be true.

It is not possible for the premises of a valid argument to be true, but for the conclusion to be false.

A proof is a valid argument whose premises are all true.


Hence a valid argument that has one or more false premises is not a proof.
