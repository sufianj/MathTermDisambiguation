Definition:Parenthesis,Aggregation,"Parenthesis is a syntactical technique to disambiguate the meaning of a logical formula.

It allows one to specify that a logical formula should (temporarily) be regarded as being a single entity, being on the same level as a statement variable.

Such a formula is referred to as being in parenthesis.

Typically, a formal language, in defining its formal grammar, ensures by means of parenthesis that all of its well-formed words are uniquely readable.


Generally, brackets are used to indicate that certain formulas are in parenthesis.

The brackets that are mostly used are round ones, the left (round) bracket ( and the right (round) bracket )."

=== Letter ===
A letter of a formal language is a more or less arbitrary symbol whose interpretation depends on the specific context.

Each signature for the language may have a different vocabulary.

However, different signatures only have different members of the respective classes of symbols comprising the alphabet, rather than introducing new such classes.

=== Sign ===

In building a formal language, signs form the hooks allowing the formal grammar to define the well-formed formulae of the formal language.


Common examples of signs are parentheses, ""("" and "")"", and the comma, "","".

Definition:Argument of Complex Number,Argument,"Let z = x + i y be a complex number.

An argument of z, or z, is formally defined as a solution to the pair of equations:
:(1):    x | z | = cos(   ) z
:(2):    y | z | = sin(   ) z
where | z | is the modulus of z.

From Sine and Cosine are Periodic on Reals, it follows that if θ is an argument of z, then so is θ + 2 k π where k ∈ℤ is any integer.


Thus, the argument of a complex number z is a continuous multifunction.

 


=== Principal Range ===
It is understood that the argument of a complex number z is unique only up to multiples of 2 k π.

With this understanding, we can limit the choice of what θ can be for any given z by requiring that θ lie in some half open interval of length 2 π.

The most usual of these are:
:[ 0  . . )2 π
:( -π . . ]π

but in theory any such interval may be used.

This interval is known as the principal range.

=== Principal Argument ===
Let R be the principal range of the complex numbers ℂ.

The unique value of θ in R is known as the principal argument, of z.

This is denoted Arg( z ).

Note the capital A.

The standard practice is for R to be ( -π . . ]π.

This ensures that the principal argument is continuous on the real axis for positive numbers.

Thus, if z is represented in the complex plane, the principal argument Arg( z ) is intuitively defined as the angle which z yields with the real (y = 0) axis.


 "
Definition:Logical Argument,Argument,"A logical argument (or just argument) is a process of creating a new statement from one or more existing statements.

An argument proceeds from a set of premises to a conclusion, by means of logical implication, via a procedure called logical inference.


An argument may have more than one premise, but only one conclusion.


While statements may be classified as either true or false, an argument may be classified as either valid or invalid.


Loosely speaking, a valid argument is one that leads unshakeably from true statements to other true statements, whereas an invalid argument is one that can lead you to, for example, a false statement from one which is true.


Thus:
:An argument may be valid, even though its premises are false.
:An argument may be invalid, even though its premises are true.
:An argument may be invalid and its premises false.

It is even possible for the conclusion of an argument to be true, even though the argument is invalid and its premises are false.


To be sure of the truth of a conclusion, it is necessary to make sure both that the premises are true and that the argument is valid.


However, while you may not actually know whether a statement is true or not, you can investigate the consequences of it being either true or false, and see what effect that has on the truth value of the proposition(s) of which it is a part. That, in short, is what the process of logical argument consists of.


An argument may be described symbolically by means of sequents, which specify the flow of an argument.


=== Finitary Argument ===
A finitary argument is a logical argument which starts with a finite number of axioms, and can be translated into a finite number of statements."
Definition:Preimage/Mapping/Element,Argument,"Let f: S → T be a mapping.

Let f^-1⊆ T × S be the inverse of f, defined as:

:f^-1 = {( t, s ): f (   )s = t }


Every s ∈ S such that f (   )s = t is called a preimage of t.


The preimage of an element t ∈ T is defined as:

:f^-1(   )t := { s ∈ S: f (   )s = t }


This can also be expressed as:
:f^-1(   )t := { s ∈Img( f^-1): ( t, s ) ∈ f^-1}


That is, the preimage of t under f is the image of t under f^-1."

Let ∠ BAC be a right angle.

Let ∠ BAD + ∠ DAC = ∠ BAC.

Then ∠ DAC is the complement of ∠ BAD.


Hence, for any angle α (whether less than a right angle or not), the complement of α is π 2 - α.

Measured in degrees, the complement of α is 90^∘ - α.


If α is the complement of β, then it follows that β is the complement of α.

Hence we can say that α and β are complementary.


It can be seen from this that the complement of an angle greater than a right angle is negative.


Thus complementary angles are two angles whose measures add up to the measure of a right angle.

A complex number is a number in the form a + b i or a + i b where:

:i is a square root of -1, that is, i = √(-1).

=== Formal Definition ===
A complex number is an ordered pair ( x, y ) where x, y ∈ℝ are real numbers, on which the operations of addition and multiplication are defined as follows:


=== Complex Addition ===
Let ( x_1, y_1 ) and ( x_2, y_2 ) be complex numbers.

Then + is a binary operation defined as:

:( x_1, y_1 ) + ( x_2, y_2 ):= ( x_1 + x_2, y_1 + y_2 )

=== Complex Multiplication ===
Let ( x_1, y_1 ) and ( x_2, y_2 ) be complex numbers.


Then ( x_1, y_1 ) ( x_2, y_2 ) is defined as:

:( x_1, y_1 ) ( x_2, y_2 ) := ( x_1 x_2 - y_1 y_2, x_1 y_2 + y_1 x_2 )

=== Scalar Product ===
Let ( x, y ) be a complex number.

Let m ∈ℝ be a real number.


Then m ( x, y ) is defined as:

:m ( x, y ) := ( m x, m y )

=== Construction from Cayley-Dickson Construction ===
The complex numbers can be defined by the Cayley-Dickson construction from the set of real numbers ℝ.

From Real Numbers form Algebra, ℝ forms a nicely normed *-algebra.

Let a, b ∈ℝ.

Then ( a, b ) ∈ℂ, where:

:( a, b ) ( c, d ) = ( a c - d b, a d + c b )
:( a, b )  = ( a, -b )
where:
:a is the conjugate of a
and 
:( a, b ) is the conjugation operation on ℂ.

From Real Numbers form Algebra, a = a and so the above translate into:

:( a, b ) ( c, d ) = ( a c - d b, a d + c b )
:( a, b )  = ( a, -b )


It is clear by direct comparison with the formal definition that this construction genuinely does generate the complex numbers."

Then the (complex) conjugate of z is denoted z and is defined as:

: ·: ℂ→ℂ: z ↦z.
where z is the complex conjugate of z.

Definition:Digraph,Directed,"A digraph is a graph each of whose edges has a direction:



In the above digraph, the vertices are v_1, v_2, v_3 and v_4.


=== Arc ===
Let G = ( V, E ) be a digraph.

The arcs are the elements of E.

Informally, an arc is a line that joins one vertex to another.


If e ∈ E is an arc joining the vertex u to the vertex v, it is denoted u v.


=== Endvertex ===
Let D = ( V, E ) be a digraph.

Let e = u v be an arc of D, that is, e ∈ E.


The endvertices of e are the vertices u and v.


=== Initial Vertex ===
Let D = ( V, E ) be a digraph.

Let e = u v be an arc of D, that is, e ∈ E.


The initial vertex of e is the endvertex u which e is incident from.

=== Final Vertex ===
Let D = ( V, E ) be a digraph.

Let e = u v be an arc of D, that is, e ∈ E.


The final vertex of e is the endvertex v which e is incident to.

In the above graph, the arcs are v_1 v_2, v_2 v_4, v_4 v_3, v_4 v_1 and v_1 v_4.


As can be seen, in this general definition it is allowable for an arc to go in both directions between a given pair of vertices.


=== Formal Definition ===



A directed graph or digraph D is a non-empty set V together with an antireflexive relation E on V.

The elements of E are the arcs.


Thus the above digraph can be defined as:

:D = ( V, E ):
::V = { v_1, v_2, v_3, v_4 }
::E = {( v_1, v_2 ), ( v_2, v_4 ), ( v_4, v_3 ), ( v_4, v_1 ), ( v_1, v_4 )  }

=== Category-Theoretic Definition ===
Let 𝐒𝐞𝐭 be the category of sets.

A digraph is an arrangement of the following form in 𝐒𝐞𝐭:

::<0em,0em>*E = ""E"",
<5em,0em>*V = ""V"",

""E""+/^.3em/+/r1em/;""V""+/^.3em/+/l1em/ **@- ?>*@> ?*!/_.6em/s,
""E""+/_.3em/+/r1em/;""V""+/_.3em/+/l1em/ **@- ?>*@> ?*!/^.6em/t,

=== Symmetric Digraph ===
Let D = ( V, E ) be a digraph such that the relation E in D is symmetric.

Then D is called a symmetric digraph.


It follows from the definition of a (simple) graph that a symmetric digraph is in fact the same thing as an undirected graph.

=== Simple Digraph ===
Let D = ( V, E ) be a digraph.

If the relation E in D is also specifically asymmetric, then D is called a simple digraph.

That is, in a simple digraph there are no pairs of arcs (like there are between v_1 and v_4 in the diagram above) which go in both directions between two vertices."

: there exists a bijective differentiable strictly increasing real function:
:: ϕ: [c  . .  d] →[a  . .  b]

But vertical lines are overused – for absolute values, set delimiters, conditional probabilities, etc. – and backward slashes are underused. Moreover, 'm \ n' gives an impression that m is the denominator of an implied ratio. So we shall boldly let our divisibility symbol lean leftward.


An unfortunate unwelcome side-effect of this notational convention is that to indicate non-divisibility, the conventional technique of implementing / through the notation looks awkward with \, so \ is eschewed in favour of ∤.


Some sources use | -10mu  3pt - or similar to denote non-divisibility.

Definition:Domain (Relation Theory),Domain,"=== Relation ===
Let ℛ⊆ S × T be a relation.

The domain of ℛ is defined and denoted as:
:Dom( ℛ) := { s ∈ S: ∃ t ∈ T: ( s, t ) ∈ℛ}


That is, it is the same as what is defined here as the preimage of ℛ.


=== General Definition ===
Let ∏_i  = 1^n S_i be the cartesian product of sets S_1 to S_n.

Let ℛ⊆∏_i  = 1^n S_i be an n-ary relation on ∏_i  = 1^n S_i.

The concept is usually encountered when ℛ is an endorelation on S:
:Dom( ℛ) := {( s_1, s_2, …, s_n - 1) ∈ S^n - 1: ∃ s_n ∈ S_n: ( s_1, s_2, …, s_n ) ∈ℛ}

That is, it is the class of all x such that ( x, y ) ∈ℛ for at least one y.

=== Mapping ===

The term domain is usually seen when the relation in question is actually a mapping.

Let f: S → T be a mapping.

The domain of f is S, and can be denoted Dom( f ).

=== Binary Operation ===
Let ∘: S × S → T be a binary operation.

The domain of ∘ is the set S and can be denoted Dom( ∘).


This definition can be considered as the same as that for the domain of a mapping, where the domain would be defined as S × S.

Definition:Set Intersection,Intersection,"Let S and T be sets.


The (set) intersection of S and T is written S ∩ T.

It means the set which consists of all the elements which are contained in both of S and T:

:x ∈ S ∩ T  x ∈ S  x ∈ T

or, more formally:

:A = S ∩ T ∀ z: ( z ∈ A  z ∈ S  z ∈ T )


We can write:

:S ∩ T := { x: x ∈ S  x ∈ T }

and can voice it S intersect T.


It can be seen that, in this form, ∩ is a binary operation which acts on sets.


One often says that two sets intersect  if and only if  they have non-empty intersection.


=== Set of Sets ===
Let S be a set of sets.

The intersection of S is:
:⋂ S := { x: ∀ S ∈ S: x ∈ S }
That is, the set of all objects that are elements of all the elements of S.


Thus:
:⋂{ S, T } := S ∩ T

Let I be an indexing set.

Let ⟨ S_i ⟩_i ∈ I be a family of sets indexed by I.


Then the intersection of ⟨ S_i ⟩ is defined as:

:⋂_i ∈ I S_i := { x: ∀ i ∈ I: x ∈ S_i }


=== In the context of the Universal Set ===

In treatments of set theory in which the concept of the universal set is recognised, this can be expressed as follows.

Let 𝕌 be a universal set.

Let I be an indexing set.

Let ⟨ S_i ⟩_i ∈ I be an indexed family of subsets of 𝕌.


Then the intersection of ⟨ S_i ⟩ is defined and denoted as:

:⋂_i ∈ I S_i := { x ∈𝕌: ∀ i ∈ I: x ∈ S_i }

=== Subsets of General Set ===
This definition is the same when the universal set 𝕌 is replaced by any set X, which may or may not be a universal set:

Let I be an indexing set.

Let ⟨ S_i ⟩_i ∈ I be an indexed family of subsets of a set X.


Then the intersection of ⟨ S_i ⟩ is defined as:

:⋂_i ∈ I S_i := { x ∈ X: ∃ i ∈ I: x ∈ S_i }
where i is a bound variable.

=== Countable Intersection ===
Let 𝕊 be a set of sets.

Let ⟨ S_n ⟩_n ∈ℕ be a sequence in 𝕊.

Let S be the intersection of ⟨ S_n ⟩_n ∈ℕ:
:S = ⋂_n ∈ℕ S_n


Then S is a countable intersection of sets in 𝕊.

=== Finite Intersection ===
Let S = S_1 ∩ S_2 ∩…∩ S_n.

Then:
:S = ⋂_i ∈ℕ^*_n S_i := { x: ∀ i ∈ℕ^*_n: x ∈ S_i }
where ℕ^*_n = { 1, 2, 3, …, n }.


If it is clear from the context that i ∈ℕ^*_n, we can also write ⋂_ℕ^*_n S_i."
Definition:Intersection (Geometry),Intersection,"The intersection of two lines AB and CD is denoted by AB ∩ CD.

Thus we can define the power to a positive rational number:

Let r =  p q ∈ℚ be a positive rational number where p ∈ℤ_≥ 0, q ∈ℤ_> 0.

Then x^r is defined as:

This definition is an extension of the definition for rational r.

Category:Definitions/Abstract Machines"
Definition:Unlimited Register Machine,Machine,"An unlimited register machine, abbreviated URM, is an abstract machine with the following characteristics:


=== Registers ===
A URM has a sequence of registers which can store natural numbers: { 0, 1, 2, …}.

Any given URM program may make use of only a finite number of these registers.


Registers are usually referred to by the subscripted uppercase letters R_1, R_2, R_3, ….

The number held at any one time by a register is usually referred to by the corresponding lowercase letter r_1, r_2, r_3, ….


The registers are unlimited in the following two senses:
:(1): Although a URM program may make use of only a finite number of registers, there is no actual upper bound on how many a particular URM program can actually use.
:(2): There is no upper bound on the size of the natural numbers that may be stored in any register.


=== Index of Register ===
The subscript (which is a natural number) appended to a URM register is called the index of that register.

Hence, for example, the index of register R_5 is 5.

=== Program ===
The numbers held in the registers of a URM are manipulated according to a program.

A URM program is a finite sequence of basic instructions.


=== Basic Instruction ===
The basic instructions of a URM program form a finite sequence and hence can be considered a set indexed by the (positive) integer 1, 2, 3, ….


The basic instructions are as follows:


Name     	Notation          	Effect                     	Description
Zero     	Z (   )n        	0 → R_n                	Replace the number in R_n by 0.
Successor	S (   )n        	r_n + 1 → R_n          	Add 1 to the number in R_n.
Copy     	C (   )m, n   	r_m → R_n              	Replace the number in R_n by the number in R_m (leaving the one in R_m as it was).
Jump     	J (   )m, n, q	r_m = r_n ? ⇒ q	If the numbers in R_m and R_n are equal, go to instruction number q, otherwise go to the next instruction.



=== Execution ===
The operation of carrying out a basic URM instruction is referred to as execution.

=== Execution ===
The operation of carrying out a basic URM instruction is referred to as execution.

=== Line Number ===
For historical reasons, the index of an instruction in a given URM program is called its line number.

We can refer either to the line of the program or the line in the URM.

=== Set of All URM Programs ===
It is convenient to use U to stand for the set of all URM programs.

=== Length of Program ===
Let U denote the set of all URM programs.

Let P ∈ U be a URM program.

By definition, P is a finite sequence of basic instructions.


We define the function λ:  U →ℕ as follows:
:∀ P ∈ U: λ(   )P = the number of basic instructions that comprise P

Thus λ(   )P is referred to as the length of P.

=== Highest Register ===
Let U denote the set of all URM programs.

Let P ∈ U be a URM program.

By definition, P uses a finite number of registers.


We define the function ρ:  U →ℕ as follows:
:∀ P ∈ U: ρ(   )P = the highest register number used by P

That is, in any URM program P, no instruction refers to any register with index greater than ρ(   )P.

=== Highest Register ===
Let U denote the set of all URM programs.

Let P ∈ U be a URM program.

By definition, P uses a finite number of registers.


We define the function ρ:  U →ℕ as follows:
:∀ P ∈ U: ρ(   )P = the highest register number used by P

That is, in any URM program P, no instruction refers to any register with index greater than ρ(   )P.

=== Termination ===
A URM program terminates when there are no more instructions to execute.

This can happen in either of two ways:
:(1): If the program executes the last instruction, and this does not involve a Jump to an earlier instruction, the program will stop.
:(2): If the program executes a Jump instruction to a non-existent instruction, the program will stop.


=== Exit Jump ===
 

Such a Jump instruction is known as an exit jump .

=== Exit Line ===
 

The line on which a particular run of a URM program stops is called the exit line.


=== Endless Loop ===
 

If a URM program, when running, never reaches a state where it terminates, then it is said to be in an endless loop and will never terminate.

 

Note that whether a program terminates or not may depend on its input.

It may terminate perfectly well for one input, but go into an endless loop on another.

=== Input ===

The input to a URM program is:
:either an ordered k-tuple ( n_1, n_2, …, n_k ) ∈ℕ^k
:or a natural number n ∈ℕ.


In the latter case, it is convenient to consider a single natural number as an ordered 1-tuple ( n_1 ) ∈ℕ^1 = ℕ.

Hence we can discuss inputs to URM programs solely as instances of tuples, and not be concerned with cumbersome repetition for the cases where k = 1 and otherwise.


The convention usually used is for a URM program P to start computation with:
:the input (n_1, n_2, …, n_k) in registers R_1, R_2, …, R_k
:0 in all other registers used by P.


That is, the initial state of the URM is:
:∀ i ∈[ 1  . . ]k: r_i = n_i
:∀ i > k: r_i = 0.


It is usual for the input (either all or part) to be overwritten during the course of the operation of a program. That is, at the end of a program, R_1, R_2, …, R_k are not guaranteed still to contain n_1, n_2, …, n_k unless the program has been explicitly written so as to ensure that this is the case.


=== Output ===

At the end of the running of a URM program, the output will be found in register R_1.

=== Operation ===
When a URM runs a program, it always starts by executing the first instruction of the program.

When it has executed an instruction, it moves to the next instruction and executes that one, unless required otherwise by a Jump instruction.


=== Execution ===
The operation of carrying out a basic URM instruction is referred to as execution.

=== Instruction Pointer ===
The line number of the instruction which is currently about to be executed is known as the instruction pointer.

It can be imagined as a special-purpose register in the URM whose purpose is to hold that line number.

=== Stage of Computation ===
The stage of computation (or just stage) of a URM program is the count of how many instructions have been executed.

Thus each stage corresponds to the processing of one instruction.

=== State ===
The state of a URM program at a particular stage is defined as:
:(1): the value of the instruction pointer
:(2): the values contained by each of the registers that are used by the URM program.

=== State ===
The state of a URM program at a particular stage is defined as:
:(1): the value of the instruction pointer
:(2): the values contained by each of the registers that are used by the URM program.

=== Input ===

The input to a URM program is:
:either an ordered k-tuple ( n_1, n_2, …, n_k ) ∈ℕ^k
:or a natural number n ∈ℕ.


In the latter case, it is convenient to consider a single natural number as an ordered 1-tuple ( n_1 ) ∈ℕ^1 = ℕ.

Hence we can discuss inputs to URM programs solely as instances of tuples, and not be concerned with cumbersome repetition for the cases where k = 1 and otherwise.


The convention usually used is for a URM program P to start computation with:
:the input (n_1, n_2, …, n_k) in registers R_1, R_2, …, R_k
:0 in all other registers used by P.


That is, the initial state of the URM is:
:∀ i ∈[ 1  . . ]k: r_i = n_i
:∀ i > k: r_i = 0.


It is usual for the input (either all or part) to be overwritten during the course of the operation of a program. That is, at the end of a program, R_1, R_2, …, R_k are not guaranteed still to contain n_1, n_2, …, n_k unless the program has been explicitly written so as to ensure that this is the case.


=== Output ===

At the end of the running of a URM program, the output will be found in register R_1.


=== Null Program ===
The null URM program is a URM program which contains no instructions.

That is, a URM program whose length is zero."
Definition:Turing Machine,Machine,"A Turing machine is an abstract machine which works by manipulating symbols on an imaginary piece of paper by means of a specific set of algorithmic rules.

To simplify things, the piece of paper being worked on is in the form of a series of boxes on a one-dimensional ""tape"" divided into squares.

Each square can be either blank or can contain a symbol taken from a finite set, e.g. s_1, s_2, …, s_α.


The machine examines one square at a time, and carries out an action determined by both:
:(1): the symbol in the square
:(2): the current internal state of the machine.

The internal state of the machine is a way of providing a device that can keep track of the symbols in other squares.

There can be only a finite set of these states, say q_1, q_2, …, q_β.


The actions that the machine can take are as follows:
:(1): Replace the symbol in the square with another symbol
:(2): Move to examine the square in the immediate left of the current square being looked at
:(3): Move to examine the square in the immediate right of the current square being looked at.

After carrying out an action, the machine may change to a different internal state.


The program for the machine is a set of instructions which specify:
:(1): what action to take in some possible combinations of the internal state and symbol in the square currently being read
:(2): which internal state the machine moves into after carrying out that action.

Thus the instructions have the following form:
:q_i    s_j    A    q_t
which is interpreted as:

""If:
:* the machine is in internal state q_i
: the symbol in the square currently being examined is s_j
then:
: Carry out action A
: Move into internal state q_t.


The actions can be abbreviated to:
: L: Move one square to the left
: R: Move one square to the right
: s_k: Replace the symbol in the square currently being read with symbol s_k.


The computation stops when there is no instruction which specifies what should be done in the current combination of internal state and symbol being read.


=== Formal Definition ===

 

A Turing machine is a 7-tuple ( Q, x3a3, Γ, δ, q_0, B, F ) that satisfies the following:
* Q is a finite set, the states of the Turing machine.
* x3a3 is a finite set, the input symbols.
* Γ⊋x3a3 is a finite superset of the input symbols, called the tape symbols.
** For convenience, we also require that Γ and Q are disjoint.
* δ : Q ×Γ→ Q ×Γ×{ L, R } is a partial mapping, the transition function.
** L and R are arbitrary constants called directions.
* q_0 ∈ Q is a distinguished state called the start state.
* B ∈Γ is a distinguished tape symbol called the blank symbol. B must not be an element of x3a3.
* F ⊂ Q be a designated subset of the states called accepting states.


An instantaneous description of a Turing machine is a finite sequence of elements of Γ∪ Q, subject to the following conditions:
* There is exactly one element of Q in the sequence.
* The first entry in the sequence is not B.
* The last entry in the sequence is not in Q.
* If the last entry in the sequence is B, then the second-to-last is in Q.

By this definition, an instantaneous description can always be written as:
:X_m X_m-1… X_2 X_1 q Y Z_1 Z_2 … Z_n-1 Z_n
where m or n may be 0; X_i, Y, and Z_j are all elements of Γ; and q is an element of Q.

Additionally, X_m and Z_n are not B if they exist; that is, if m and n are not 0, respectively.


A move reduces one instantaneous description into another by applying the transition function.

We write A ⊢ B if a machine with instantaneous description A has, after a single move, instantaneous description B.

:X_m … X_1 q Y Z_1 Z_2 … Z_n ⊢ X_m … X_1 Y' q' Z_1 Z_2 … Z_n

* If d = R and n > 0, but m = 0 and Y' = B then:
:q Y Z_1 Z_2 … Z_n ⊢ q' Z_1 Z_2 … Z_n

* If d = R but n = 0, and either m > 0 or Y' ≠ B then:

A machine M halts on an input w, using the same special case for the null string as above,  if and only if  for some α, β∈Γ^*, X ∈Γ, and q ∈ Q:
:q_0 w ⊢^* α q X β

Definition:Nondeterministic Turing Machine,Machine,"A nondeterministic Turing machine (NTM) is a variation of the classical Turing machine that relaxes the restriction that all the steps in the machine must be definite.

That is, given a single internal state and a single character being read on the tape the machine may have more than one possible response.

If any sequence of choices puts the machine into a halting state, then the machine stops after n steps, where n is the minimum number of steps needed to put the machine into a halting state.

A move reduces one instantaneous description into another by applying the transition function. There may be many possible moves from any given instantaneous description.

We write A ⊢ B if a machine with instantaneous description A may have, after a single move, instantaneous description B.

Then (T, +_T, ∘_T)_K is a (vector) subspace of (S, +, ∘)_K.


When considering Hilbert spaces, one wants to deal with projections onto subspaces.

These projections however require the linear subspace to be closed in topological sense in order to be well-defined.

Therefore, in treatises of Hilbert spaces, one encounters the terminology linear manifold for the concept of vector subspace defined above.

The adapted definition of linear subspace is then that it is a topologically closed linear manifold."

That is, to find out the geometric mean of a set of n numbers, multiply them together and take the nth root.


=== Mean Proportional ===
In the language of  , the geometric mean of two magnitudes is called the mean proportional.

Thus the mean proportional of a and b is defined as that magnitude c such that:

This means that elements of S with a larger weight contribute more to the weighted mean than those with a smaller weight.


If we write:

we can write this weighted mean as:
:x̅ := w_1 x_1 + w_2 x_2 + ⋯ + w_n x_nw_1 + w_2 + ⋯ + w_n


From the definition of the weight function, none of the weights can be negative.

Let ( a_1, a_2, …, a_n ) ∈ S^n be an ordered n-tuple in S.


The composite is called the continued product of ( a_1, a_2, …, a_n ), and is written:

:∏_j  = 1^n a_j = ( a_1 × a_2 ×⋯× a_n )

Let ( S, ×) be an algebraic structure where the operation × is an operation derived from, or arising from, the multiplication operation on the natural numbers.

=== Definition by Propositional Function ===
Let ( S, ×) be an algebraic structure where the operation × is an operation derived from, or arising from, the multiplication operation on the natural numbers.

Let ( a_1, a_2, …, a_n ) ∈ S^n be an ordered n-tuple in S.


Let R (   )j be a propositional function of j.

Then we can write:

:∏_R (   )j a_j =  the product of all a_j such that R (   )j holds.


If more than one propositional function is written under the product sign, they must all hold.


Such an operation on an ordered tuple is known as a continued product.


Note that the definition by inequality form 1 ≤ j ≤ n is a special case of such a propositional function.

Also note that the definition by index form ∏_j  = 1^n is merely another way of writing ∏_1 ≤ j ≤ n.

Hence all instances of a continued product can be expressed in terms of a propositional function.

The cartesian product S × T of S and T is the set of ordered pairs ( x, y ) with x ∈ S and y ∈ T:

Another way of defining it is by:

:( x, y ) ∈ S × T  x ∈ S, y ∈ T

:∀ p: ( p ∈ S × T ∃ x: ∃ y: x ∈ S  y ∈ T  p = ( x, y )  )


S × T can be voiced S cross T.


=== Class Theory ===
Let A and B be classes.


The cartesian product A × B of A and B is the class of ordered pairs ( x, y ) with x ∈ A and y ∈ B:

=== Finite Cartesian Product ===
Let ⟨ S_n ⟩ be a sequence of sets.

It is also denoted S_1 × S_2 ×⋯× S_n.

Thus S_1 × S_2 ×⋯× S_n is the set of all ordered n-tuples ( x_1, x_2, …, x_n ) with x_k ∈ S_k.


In particular:
:∏_k  = 1^2 S_k = S_1 × S_2

=== Countable Cartesian Product ===

The same notation can be used to define the (countable) cartesian product of an infinite sequence:

Let ⟨ S_n ⟩_n ∈ℕ be an infinite sequence of sets. 

The cartesian product of ⟨ S_n ⟩ is defined as:

:∏_k  = 1^∞ S_k = {( x_1, x_2, …, x_n, …): ∀ k ∈ℕ: x_k ∈ S_k }


It defines the concept:
:S_1 × S_2 ×⋯× S_n ×⋯

Let P be the point on C in the first quadrant such that θ is the angle made by OP with the x-axis.

Let a tangent line be drawn to touch C at A = ( 1, 0 ).

Identify the x-axis with the real number line such that:
:0 is identified with the origin O
:1 is identified with the point P

The orientation of the x-axis is determined by the relative positions of O and P.

:to the right of the origin, the numbers on the x-axis are positive
:to the left of the origin, the numbers on the x-axis are negative.

:1 is identified with the point P'


The orientation of the y-axis is determined by the position of P' relative to O.

It is conventional to locate P' such that, if one were to imagine being positioned at O and facing along the x-axis towards P, then P' is on the left. 

Hence with the conventional orientation of the x-axis as horizontal and increasing to the right:

The Cartesian space of S indexed by I is defined and denoted as:
:S^I := { f: ( f: I → S ) ( ∀ i ∈ I: ( f (   )i ∈ S )  )  }

=== Real Cartesian Space ===

When S is the set of real numbers ℝ, the cartesian product takes on a special significance.

Let n ∈ℕ_>0.

Then ℝ^n is the cartesian product defined as follows:

:ℝ^n = ℝ×ℝ×⋯×ℝ_n times = ∏_k  = 1^n ℝ


Similarly, ℝ^n can be defined as the set of all real n-tuples:

:ℝ^n = {( x_1, x_2, …, x_n ): x_1, x_2, …, x_n ∈ℝ}


=== Cartesian Plane ===

The Cartesian plane is a Cartesian coordinate system of 2 dimensions.

Every point on the plane can be identified uniquely by means of an ordered pair of real coordinates ( x, y ), as follows:


Identify one distinct point on the plane as the origin O.

Select a point P on the plane different from O.

Construct an infinite straight line through O and P and call it the x-axis.


Identify the x-axis with the real number line such that:
:0 is identified with the origin O
:1 is identified with the point P

The orientation of the x-axis is determined by the relative positions of O and P.

It is conventional to locate P to the right of O, so as to arrange that:

:to the right of the origin, the numbers on the x-axis are positive
:to the left of the origin, the numbers on the x-axis are negative.


Construct an infinite straight line through O perpendicular to the x-axis and call it the y-axis.

Identify the point P' on the y-axis such that OP' = OP.

Identify the y-axis with the real number line such that:
:0 is identified with the origin O
:1 is identified with the point P'


The orientation of the y-axis is determined by the position of P' relative to O.

It is conventional to locate P' such that, if one were to imagine being positioned at O and facing along the x-axis towards P, then P' is on the left. 

Hence with the conventional orientation of the x-axis as horizontal and increasing to the right:

:going vertically ""up"" the page or screen from the origin, the numbers on the y-axis are positive
:going vertically ""down"" the page or screen from the origin, the numbers on the y-axis are negative.


=== Cartesian Coordinate Pair ===


Hence:
:the point P is identified with the coordinates ( 1, 0 )
:the point P' is identified with the coordinates ( 0, 1 ).


=== x Coordinate ===
Consider a Cartesian coordinate system C with an x-axis.

Let a point Q be positioned in C.


Let x be the length of the line segment from the origin O to the foot of the perpendicular from Q to the x-axis.

Then x is known as the x coordinate.

If Q is in the positive direction along the real number line that is the x-axis, then x is positive.

If Q is in the negative direction along the real number line that is the x-axis, then x is negative.

=== y Coordinate ===
Consider a Cartesian coordinate system C with a y-axis.

Let a point Q be positioned in C.


Let y be the length of the line segment from the origin O to the foot of the perpendicular from Q to the y-axis.

Then y is known as the y coordinate.

If Q is in the positive direction along the real number line that is the y-axis, then y is positive.

If Q is in the negative direction along the real number line that is the y-axis, then y is negative.

Construct an infinite straight line through O perpendicular to both the x-axis and they-axis and call it the z-axis.

Identify the point P' ' on the z-axis such that OP' ' = OP.

Identify the z-axis with the real number line such that:
:0 is identified with the origin O
:1 is identified with the point P


=== Orientation ===


Consider a Cartesian 3-Space.

Select a point P on the x-axis different from O.

Let P be identified with the coordinate pair ( 1, 0 ) in the x-y plane.

Identify the point P' on the y-axis such that OP' = OP.

Identify the point P' ' on the z-axis such that OP' ' = OP.

Let ( a_1, a_2, …, a_n ) ∈ S^n be an ordered n-tuple in S.


The composite is called the summation of ( a_1, a_2, …, a_n ), and is written:

:∑_j  = 1^n a_j = ( a_1 + a_2 + ⋯ + a_n )

=== Multiple Indices ===

=== Definition by Propositional Function ===
Let ( S, + ) be an algebraic structure where the operation + is an operation derived from, or arising from, the addition operation on the natural numbers.

Let ( a_1, a_2, …, a_n ) ∈ S^n be an ordered n-tuple in S.


Let R (   )j be a propositional function of j.

Then we can write the summation as:

:∑_R (   )j a_j =  The sum of all a_j such that R (   )j holds.


If more than one propositional function is written under the summation sign, they must all hold.


Such an operation on an ordered tuple is known as a summation.


Note that the definition by inequality form 1 ≤ j ≤ n is a special case of such a propositional function.

Also note that the definition by index form ∑_j  = 1^n is merely another way of writing ∑_1 ≤ j ≤ n.

Hence all instances of a summation can be expressed in terms of a propositional function.

This is because:

Definition:Valid Argument,Valid,"A valid argument is a logical argument in which the premises provide conclusive reasons for the conclusion.

If all the premises of a valid argument are true, then the conclusion must also therefore be true.

It is not possible for the premises of a valid argument to be true, but for the conclusion to be false.

A proof is a valid argument whose premises are all true.


Hence a valid argument that has one or more false premises is not a proof.
