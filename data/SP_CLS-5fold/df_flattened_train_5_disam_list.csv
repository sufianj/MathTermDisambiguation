Definition:Complementary Angles,Complement,":

Let ∠ BAC be a right angle.

Let ∠ BAD + ∠ DAC = ∠ BAC.

That is:
:∠ DAC = ∠ BAC - ∠ BAD


Then ∠ DAC is the complement of ∠ BAD.


Hence, for any angle α (whether less than a right angle or not), the complement of α is π 2 - α.

Measured in degrees, the complement of α is 90^∘ - α.


If α is the complement of β, then it follows that β is the complement of α.

Hence we can say that α and β are complementary.


It can be seen from this that the complement of an angle greater than a right angle is negative.


Thus complementary angles are two angles whose measures add up to the measure of a right angle.

That is, their measurements add up to 90 degrees or π 2 radians."

=== Informal Definition ===
A complex number is a number in the form a + b i or a + i b where:
:a and b are real numbers
:i is a square root of -1, that is, i = √(-1).

=== Formal Definition ===
A complex number is an ordered pair ( x, y ) where x, y ∈ℝ are real numbers, on which the operations of addition and multiplication are defined as follows:


=== Complex Addition ===
Let ( x_1, y_1 ) and ( x_2, y_2 ) be complex numbers.

Then + is a binary operation defined as:

:( x_1, y_1 ) + ( x_2, y_2 ):= ( x_1 + x_2, y_1 + y_2 )

=== Complex Multiplication ===
Let ( x_1, y_1 ) and ( x_2, y_2 ) be complex numbers.


Then ( x_1, y_1 ) ( x_2, y_2 ) is defined as:

:( x_1, y_1 ) ( x_2, y_2 ) := ( x_1 x_2 - y_1 y_2, x_1 y_2 + y_1 x_2 )

=== Scalar Product ===
Let ( x, y ) be a complex number.

Let m ∈ℝ be a real number.


Then m ( x, y ) is defined as:

:m ( x, y ) := ( m x, m y )

=== Construction from Cayley-Dickson Construction ===
The complex numbers can be defined by the Cayley-Dickson construction from the set of real numbers ℝ.

From Real Numbers form Algebra, ℝ forms a nicely normed *-algebra.

Let a, b ∈ℝ.

Then ( a, b ) ∈ℂ, where:

:( a, b ) ( c, d ) = ( a c - d b, a d + c b )
:( a, b )  = ( a, -b )
where:
:a is the conjugate of a
and 
:( a, b ) is the conjugation operation on ℂ.

From Real Numbers form Algebra, a = a and so the above translate into:

:( a, b ) ( c, d ) = ( a c - d b, a d + c b )
:( a, b )  = ( a, -b )


It is clear by direct comparison with the formal definition that this construction genuinely does generate the complex numbers."

Then the (complex) conjugate of z is denoted z and is defined as:

: ·: ℂ→ℂ: z ↦z.
where z is the complex conjugate of z.


That is, it maps a complex number to its complex conjugate.

If e ∈ E is an arc joining the vertex u to the vertex v, it is denoted u v.

The endvertices of e are the vertices u and v.

As can be seen, in this general definition it is allowable for an arc to go in both directions between a given pair of vertices.


=== Formal Definition ===



A directed graph or digraph D is a non-empty set V together with an antireflexive relation E on V.

The elements of E are the arcs.


Thus the above digraph can be defined as:

:D = ( V, E ):
::V = { v_1, v_2, v_3, v_4 }
::E = {( v_1, v_2 ), ( v_2, v_4 ), ( v_4, v_3 ), ( v_4, v_1 ), ( v_1, v_4 )  }

=== Symmetric Digraph ===

Then D is called a symmetric digraph.


It follows from the definition of a (simple) graph that a symmetric digraph is in fact the same thing as an undirected graph.

=== Simple Digraph ===
Let D = ( V, E ) be a digraph.

If the relation E in D is also specifically asymmetric, then D is called a simple digraph.

That is, in a simple digraph there are no pairs of arcs (like there are between v_1 and v_4 in the diagram above) which go in both directions between two vertices."

: there exists a bijective differentiable strictly increasing real function:
:: ϕ: [c  . .  d] →[a  . .  b]

The conventional notation for x is a divisor of y is ""x | y"", but there is a growing trend to follow the notation ""x \ y"", as espoused by   etc.

From  :
:The notation 'm | n' is actually much more common than 'm \ n' in current mathematics literature. But vertical lines are overused – for absolute values, set delimiters, conditional probabilities, etc. – and backward slashes are underused. Moreover, 'm \ n' gives an impression that m is the denominator of an implied ratio. So we shall boldly let our divisibility symbol lean leftward.


An unfortunate unwelcome side-effect of this notational convention is that to indicate non-divisibility, the conventional technique of implementing / through the notation looks awkward with \, so \ is eschewed in favour of ∤.


Some sources use | -10mu  3pt - or similar to denote non-divisibility.

A common method of constructing isomorphisms and elementary embeddings in proofs is to recursively define them a finite number of elements at a time.  For this  purpose, it is useful to have a definition of embeddings using functions which are only defined on a subset of M:

Definition:Set Intersection,Intersection,"Let S and T be sets.


The (set) intersection of S and T is written S ∩ T.

It means the set which consists of all the elements which are contained in both of S and T:

:x ∈ S ∩ T  x ∈ S  x ∈ T

or, more formally:

:A = S ∩ T ∀ z: ( z ∈ A  z ∈ S  z ∈ T )


We can write:

:S ∩ T := { x: x ∈ S  x ∈ T }

and can voice it S intersect T.


It can be seen that, in this form, ∩ is a binary operation which acts on sets.


One often says that two sets intersect  if and only if  they have non-empty intersection.


=== Set of Sets ===
Let S be a set of sets.

The intersection of S is:

=== In the context of the Universal Set ===

In treatments of set theory in which the concept of the universal set is recognised, this can be expressed as follows.

Let 𝕌 be a universal set.

Let I be an indexing set.

Let ⟨ S_i ⟩_i ∈ I be an indexed family of subsets of 𝕌.


Then the intersection of ⟨ S_i ⟩ is defined and denoted as:

:⋂_i ∈ I S_i := { x ∈𝕌: ∀ i ∈ I: x ∈ S_i }

=== Subsets of General Set ===
This definition is the same when the universal set 𝕌 is replaced by any set X, which may or may not be a universal set:

Let I be an indexing set.

Let ⟨ S_i ⟩_i ∈ I be an indexed family of subsets of a set X.


Then the intersection of ⟨ S_i ⟩ is defined as:

:⋂_i ∈ I S_i := { x ∈ X: ∃ i ∈ I: x ∈ S_i }
where i is a bound variable.

=== Countable Intersection ===
Let 𝕊 be a set of sets.

Let ⟨ S_n ⟩_n ∈ℕ be a sequence in 𝕊.

Let S be the intersection of ⟨ S_n ⟩_n ∈ℕ:
:S = ⋂_n ∈ℕ S_n


Then S is a countable intersection of sets in 𝕊.

=== Finite Intersection ===
Let S = S_1 ∩ S_2 ∩…∩ S_n.

Then:
:S = ⋂_i ∈ℕ^*_n S_i := { x: ∀ i ∈ℕ^*_n: x ∈ S_i }

If it is clear from the context that i ∈ℕ^*_n, we can also write ⋂_ℕ^*_n S_i."

That is:

:there exists a bounded linear transformation B : U → V such that: 

::A ∘ B = I_U
::B ∘ A = I_V

Definition:Power (Algebra),Involution,"=== Natural Numbers ===
Let ℕ denote the natural numbers.


For each m ∈ℕ, recursively define e_m: ℕ→ℕ to be the mapping:
:e_m (   )n =  1     : n = 0 
 m × e_m (   )x     : n = x + 1
where:
:+ denotes natural number addition.
:× denotes natural number multiplication.


e_m (   )n is then expressed as a binary operation in the form:
:m^n := e_m (   )n

and is called m to the power of n.

=== Integers ===
Let x ∈ℝ be a real number.

Let n ∈ℤ be an integer.

The expression x^n is called x to the power of n.

x^n is defined recursively as:


:x^n =  1     : n = 0 
   
 x × x^n - 1    : n > 0 
   
x^n + 1 x     : n < 0

where x^n + 1 x denotes division.


=== Even Power ===

Let n ∈ℤ be an even integer.

=== Rational Numbers ===
Let x ∈ℝ be a real number such that x > 0.

Let m ∈ℤ be an integer.

Let y = √(x) be the mth root of x.


Then we can write y = x^1/m which means the same thing as y = √(x).


Thus we can define the power to a positive rational number:

Let r =  p q ∈ℚ be a positive rational number where p ∈ℤ_≥ 0, q ∈ℤ_> 0.

Then x^r is defined as:
:x^r = x^p/q = ( √(x))^p = √(( x^p ) )


When r = -p q ∈ℚ: r < 0 we define:
:x^r = x^-p/q =  1 x^p/q
analogously for the negative integer definition.

=== Real Numbers ===
Let x ∈ℝ_>0 be a (strictly) positive real number.

Let r ∈ℝ be a real number.


We define x^r as:

:x^r := exp(   )r ln x
where exp denotes the exponential function.


This definition is an extension of the definition for rational r.

This follows from Logarithms of Powers and Exponential of Natural Logarithm: it can be seen that:
:∀ r ∈ℚ: exp(   )r ln x = exp(   )ln(   )x^r = x^r

 

=== Complex Numbers ===
Let z, k ∈ℂ be complex numbers.


z to the power of k is defined as the multifunction:

:z^k := e^k ln( z )

where:
:e^z is the exponential function
:ln is the  natural logarithm multifunction.


=== Principal Branch ===
The principal branch of a complex number raised to a complex power is defined as:

:z^k = e^k Ln z

where Ln z is the principal branch of the natural logarithm.


=== Positive Real Base ===
Let t > 0 be a real number and let k be a complex number.


The principal branch of a positive real number raised to a complex power is defined as:

:t^k = e^k ln t

where ln is the natural logarithm of a positive real number.

Then x^k is defined as:

:x^k := ∏_j  = 1^n x_j^k_j
where the powers on the   are integer powers.


Category:Definitions/Analysis

=== Power of Zero ===
Let r ∈ℝ be a real number.

(This includes the situation where r ∈ℤ or r ∈ℚ.)

When x=0, x^r is defined as follows:

:0^r =  1     : r = 0 
 0     : r > 0 
Undefined    : r < 0

This takes account of the awkward case 0^0: it is ""generally accepted"" that 0^0 = 1 as this convention agrees with certain general results which would otherwise need a special case."

Category:Definitions/Abstract Machines"
Definition:Unlimited Register Machine,Machine,"An unlimited register machine, abbreviated URM, is an abstract machine with the following characteristics:


=== Registers ===
A URM has a sequence of registers which can store natural numbers: { 0, 1, 2, …}.

Any given URM program may make use of only a finite number of these registers.


Registers are usually referred to by the subscripted uppercase letters R_1, R_2, R_3, ….

The number held at any one time by a register is usually referred to by the corresponding lowercase letter r_1, r_2, r_3, ….


The registers are unlimited in the following two senses:
:(1): Although a URM program may make use of only a finite number of registers, there is no actual upper bound on how many a particular URM program can actually use.
:(2): There is no upper bound on the size of the natural numbers that may be stored in any register.


=== Index of Register ===
The subscript (which is a natural number) appended to a URM register is called the index of that register.

Hence, for example, the index of register R_5 is 5.

=== Program ===
The numbers held in the registers of a URM are manipulated according to a program.

A URM program is a finite sequence of basic instructions.


=== Basic Instruction ===
The basic instructions of a URM program form a finite sequence and hence can be considered a set indexed by the (positive) integer 1, 2, 3, ….


The basic instructions are as follows:


Name     	Notation          	Effect                     	Description
Zero     	Z (   )n        	0 → R_n                	Replace the number in R_n by 0.
Successor	S (   )n        	r_n + 1 → R_n          	Add 1 to the number in R_n.
Copy     	C (   )m, n   	r_m → R_n              	Replace the number in R_n by the number in R_m (leaving the one in R_m as it was).
Jump     	J (   )m, n, q	r_m = r_n ? ⇒ q	If the numbers in R_m and R_n are equal, go to instruction number q, otherwise go to the next instruction.



=== Execution ===
The operation of carrying out a basic URM instruction is referred to as execution.

=== Execution ===
The operation of carrying out a basic URM instruction is referred to as execution.

=== Line Number ===
For historical reasons, the index of an instruction in a given URM program is called its line number.

We can refer either to the line of the program or the line in the URM.

=== Set of All URM Programs ===
It is convenient to use U to stand for the set of all URM programs.

=== Length of Program ===
Let U denote the set of all URM programs.

Let P ∈ U be a URM program.

By definition, P is a finite sequence of basic instructions.


We define the function λ:  U →ℕ as follows:
:∀ P ∈ U: λ(   )P = the number of basic instructions that comprise P

Thus λ(   )P is referred to as the length of P.

=== Highest Register ===
Let U denote the set of all URM programs.

Let P ∈ U be a URM program.

By definition, P uses a finite number of registers.


We define the function ρ:  U →ℕ as follows:
:∀ P ∈ U: ρ(   )P = the highest register number used by P

That is, in any URM program P, no instruction refers to any register with index greater than ρ(   )P.

=== Highest Register ===
Let U denote the set of all URM programs.

Let P ∈ U be a URM program.

By definition, P uses a finite number of registers.


We define the function ρ:  U →ℕ as follows:
:∀ P ∈ U: ρ(   )P = the highest register number used by P

That is, in any URM program P, no instruction refers to any register with index greater than ρ(   )P.

=== Termination ===
A URM program terminates when there are no more instructions to execute.

This can happen in either of two ways:
:(1): If the program executes the last instruction, and this does not involve a Jump to an earlier instruction, the program will stop.
:(2): If the program executes a Jump instruction to a non-existent instruction, the program will stop.


=== Exit Jump ===
 

Such a Jump instruction is known as an exit jump .

=== Exit Line ===
 

The line on which a particular run of a URM program stops is called the exit line.


=== Endless Loop ===
 

If a URM program, when running, never reaches a state where it terminates, then it is said to be in an endless loop and will never terminate.

 

Note that whether a program terminates or not may depend on its input.

It may terminate perfectly well for one input, but go into an endless loop on another.

=== Input ===

The input to a URM program is:
:either an ordered k-tuple ( n_1, n_2, …, n_k ) ∈ℕ^k
:or a natural number n ∈ℕ.


In the latter case, it is convenient to consider a single natural number as an ordered 1-tuple ( n_1 ) ∈ℕ^1 = ℕ.

Hence we can discuss inputs to URM programs solely as instances of tuples, and not be concerned with cumbersome repetition for the cases where k = 1 and otherwise.


The convention usually used is for a URM program P to start computation with:
:the input (n_1, n_2, …, n_k) in registers R_1, R_2, …, R_k
:0 in all other registers used by P.


That is, the initial state of the URM is:
:∀ i ∈[ 1  . . ]k: r_i = n_i
:∀ i > k: r_i = 0.


It is usual for the input (either all or part) to be overwritten during the course of the operation of a program. That is, at the end of a program, R_1, R_2, …, R_k are not guaranteed still to contain n_1, n_2, …, n_k unless the program has been explicitly written so as to ensure that this is the case.


=== Output ===

At the end of the running of a URM program, the output will be found in register R_1.

=== Operation ===
When a URM runs a program, it always starts by executing the first instruction of the program.

When it has executed an instruction, it moves to the next instruction and executes that one, unless required otherwise by a Jump instruction.


=== Execution ===
The operation of carrying out a basic URM instruction is referred to as execution.

=== Instruction Pointer ===
The line number of the instruction which is currently about to be executed is known as the instruction pointer.

It can be imagined as a special-purpose register in the URM whose purpose is to hold that line number.

=== Stage of Computation ===
The stage of computation (or just stage) of a URM program is the count of how many instructions have been executed.

Thus each stage corresponds to the processing of one instruction.

=== State ===
The state of a URM program at a particular stage is defined as:
:(1): the value of the instruction pointer
:(2): the values contained by each of the registers that are used by the URM program.

=== Instruction Pointer ===
The line number of the instruction which is currently about to be executed is known as the instruction pointer.

It can be imagined as a special-purpose register in the URM whose purpose is to hold that line number.

=== Input ===

The input to a URM program is:
:either an ordered k-tuple ( n_1, n_2, …, n_k ) ∈ℕ^k
:or a natural number n ∈ℕ.


In the latter case, it is convenient to consider a single natural number as an ordered 1-tuple ( n_1 ) ∈ℕ^1 = ℕ.

Hence we can discuss inputs to URM programs solely as instances of tuples, and not be concerned with cumbersome repetition for the cases where k = 1 and otherwise.


The convention usually used is for a URM program P to start computation with:
:the input (n_1, n_2, …, n_k) in registers R_1, R_2, …, R_k
:0 in all other registers used by P.


That is, the initial state of the URM is:
:∀ i ∈[ 1  . . ]k: r_i = n_i
:∀ i > k: r_i = 0.


It is usual for the input (either all or part) to be overwritten during the course of the operation of a program. That is, at the end of a program, R_1, R_2, …, R_k are not guaranteed still to contain n_1, n_2, …, n_k unless the program has been explicitly written so as to ensure that this is the case.


=== Output ===

At the end of the running of a URM program, the output will be found in register R_1.


=== Null Program ===
The null URM program is a URM program which contains no instructions.

That is, a URM program whose length is zero."
Definition:Turing Machine,Machine,"A Turing machine is an abstract machine which works by manipulating symbols on an imaginary piece of paper by means of a specific set of algorithmic rules.

To simplify things, the piece of paper being worked on is in the form of a series of boxes on a one-dimensional ""tape"" divided into squares.

Each square can be either blank or can contain a symbol taken from a finite set, e.g. s_1, s_2, …, s_α.


The machine examines one square at a time, and carries out an action determined by both:
:(1): the symbol in the square
:(2): the current internal state of the machine.

The internal state of the machine is a way of providing a device that can keep track of the symbols in other squares.

There can be only a finite set of these states, say q_1, q_2, …, q_β.


The actions that the machine can take are as follows:
:(1): Replace the symbol in the square with another symbol
:(2): Move to examine the square in the immediate left of the current square being looked at
:(3): Move to examine the square in the immediate right of the current square being looked at.

After carrying out an action, the machine may change to a different internal state.


The program for the machine is a set of instructions which specify:
:(1): what action to take in some possible combinations of the internal state and symbol in the square currently being read
:(2): which internal state the machine moves into after carrying out that action.

Thus the instructions have the following form:
:q_i    s_j    A    q_t
which is interpreted as:

""If:
:* the machine is in internal state q_i
: the symbol in the square currently being examined is s_j
then:
: Carry out action A
: Move into internal state q_t.

=== Formal Definition ===

 

A Turing machine is a 7-tuple ( Q, x3a3, Γ, δ, q_0, B, F ) that satisfies the following:
* Q is a finite set, the states of the Turing machine.
* x3a3 is a finite set, the input symbols.
* Γ⊋x3a3 is a finite superset of the input symbols, called the tape symbols.
** For convenience, we also require that Γ and Q are disjoint.
* δ : Q ×Γ→ Q ×Γ×{ L, R } is a partial mapping, the transition function.
** L and R are arbitrary constants called directions.
* q_0 ∈ Q is a distinguished state called the start state.
* B ∈Γ is a distinguished tape symbol called the blank symbol. B must not be an element of x3a3.
* F ⊂ Q be a designated subset of the states called accepting states.


An instantaneous description of a Turing machine is a finite sequence of elements of Γ∪ Q, subject to the following conditions:
* There is exactly one element of Q in the sequence.
* The first entry in the sequence is not B.
* The last entry in the sequence is not in Q.
* If the last entry in the sequence is B, then the second-to-last is in Q.

By this definition, an instantaneous description can always be written as:
:X_m X_m-1… X_2 X_1 q Y Z_1 Z_2 … Z_n-1 Z_n
where m or n may be 0; X_i, Y, and Z_j are all elements of Γ; and q is an element of Q.

Additionally, X_m and Z_n are not B if they exist; that is, if m and n are not 0, respectively.


A move reduces one instantaneous description into another by applying the transition function.

We write A ⊢ B if a machine with instantaneous description A has, after a single move, instantaneous description B.

Let δ(   )q, Y = ( q', Y', d ).

Then there are seven cases to consider:

* If d = L and m > 0, and either n > 0 or Y' ≠ B then:
:X_m … X_2 X_1 q Y Z_1 … Z_n ⊢ X_m … X_2 q' X_1 Y' Z_1 … Z_n

* If d = L and m > 0, but n = 0 and Y' = B then:
:X_m … X_2 X_1 q Y ⊢ X_m … X_2 q' X_1

* If d = L but m = 0, and either n > 0 or Y' ≠ B then:
:q Y Z_1 … Z_n ⊢ q' B Y' Z_1 … Z_n

* If d = R and n > 0, and either m > 0 or Y' ≠ B then:
:X_m … X_1 q Y Z_1 Z_2 … Z_n ⊢ X_m … X_1 Y' q' Z_1 Z_2 … Z_n

* If d = R and n > 0, but m = 0 and Y' = B then:
:q Y Z_1 Z_2 … Z_n ⊢ q' Z_1 Z_2 … Z_n

* If d = R but n = 0, and either m > 0 or Y' ≠ B then:
:X_m … X_1 q Y ⊢ X_m … X_1 Y' q' B

* If m = 0, n = 0, and Y' = B then regardless of d:
:q Y ⊢ q' B


Let A ⊢^* B indicate that there exists a finite sequence ⟨ A_i ⟩_0 ≤ i ≤ n such that:
:A = A_0 ⊢ A_1 ⊢ A_2 ⊢…⊢ A_n = B


The language L (   )M accepted by the machine M is the set of strings w ∈x3a3^* for which, for some α, β∈Γ^* and p ∈ F:
:q_0 w ⊢^* α p β

As a special case, the null string is in the language  if and only if  the above holds for w = B.


A machine M halts on an input w, using the same special case for the null string as above,  if and only if  for some α, β∈Γ^*, X ∈Γ, and q ∈ Q:
:q_0 w ⊢^* α q X β
where δ(   )q, X is undefined."
Definition:Nondeterministic Turing Machine,Machine,"A nondeterministic Turing machine (NTM) is a variation of the classical Turing machine that relaxes the restriction that all the steps in the machine must be definite.

That is, given a single internal state and a single character being read on the tape the machine may have more than one possible response.

If any sequence of choices puts the machine into a halting state, then the machine stops after n steps, where n is the minimum number of steps needed to put the machine into a halting state.

In the diagram below, BAC is a sector. 

:


In fact there are two sectors, together making up the whole of the circle.

When describing a sectors by means of its three defining points (as in BAC above), the convention is to report them in the following order:

:(1): The point on the circumference at the end of the clockwise radius
:(2): The point at the center of the circle
:(3): The point on the circumference at the end of the anticlockwise radius

Thus in the sector above, BAC describes the sector indicated by θ, while the sector comprising the rest of the circle is described by CAB.

Let ( S, + ) be an algebraic structure where the operation + is an operation derived from, or arising from, the addition operation on the natural numbers.

Let ( a_1, a_2, …, a_n ) ∈ S^n be an ordered n-tuple in S.

If more than one propositional function is written under the summation sign, they must all hold.


Such an operation on an ordered tuple is known as a summation.


Note that the definition by inequality form 1 ≤ j ≤ n is a special case of such a propositional function.

Also note that the definition by index form ∑_j  = 1^n is merely another way of writing ∑_1 ≤ j ≤ n.

Definition:Valid Argument,Valid,"A valid argument is a logical argument in which the premises provide conclusive reasons for the conclusion.


When an argument is valid, we may say one of the following:

* The premises entail the conclusion;
* The conclusion is true on the strength of the premises;
* The conclusion is drawn from the premises;
* The conclusion is deduced from the premises;
* The conclusion is derived from the premises.


=== Proof ===

If all the premises of a valid argument are true, then the conclusion must also therefore be true.

It is not possible for the premises of a valid argument to be true, but for the conclusion to be false.

A proof is a valid argument whose premises are all true.


Hence a valid argument that has one or more false premises is not a proof.


Suppose P is a proposition whose truth or falsehood is to be determined.

Constructing a valid argument upon a set of premises, all of which have previously been established as being true, is called proving P.

:∀ n ∈ S: 0 ≼ n"
Definition:Zero Element,Zero,"Let ( S, ∘) be an algebraic structure.


=== Left Zero ===
Let ( S, ∘) be an algebraic structure.

An element z_L ∈ S is called a left zero element (or just left zero)  if and only if :
:∀ x ∈ S: z_L ∘ x = z_L

=== Right Zero ===
Let ( S, ∘) be an algebraic structure.

An element z_R ∈ S is called a right zero element (or just right zero)  if and only if :
:∀ x ∈ S: x ∘ z_R = z_R

=== Zero ===

An element z ∈ S is called a two-sided zero element (or simply zero element or zero)  if and only if  it is both a left zero and a right zero:
:∀ x ∈ S: x ∘ z = z = z ∘ x"
