Definition:Proof System,System,"Let ℒ be a formal language.


A proof system 𝒫 for ℒ comprises:

* Axioms and/or axiom schemata;
* Rules of inference for deriving theorems.


It is usual that a proof system does this by declaring certain arguments concerning ℒ to be valid.

Informally, a proof system amounts to a precise account of what constitutes a (formal) proof.


=== Rule of Inference ===
Let ℒ be a formal language.

Part of defining a proof system 𝒫 for ℒ is to specify its rules of inference.


A rule of inference is a specification of a valid means to conclude new theorems in 𝒫 from given theorems and axioms of 𝒫.

Often, the formulation of rules of inference also appeals to the notion of provable consequence to be able to deal with assumptions as part of a proof.

=== Axiom ===
Let ℒ be a formal language.

Part of defining a proof system 𝒫 for ℒ is to specify its axioms.


An axiom of 𝒫 is a well-formed formula of ℒ that 𝒫 approves of by definition.


=== Axiom Schema ===
Let ℒ be a formal language.

Part of defining a proof system 𝒫 for ℒ is to specify its axiom schemata.


An axiom schema is a well-formed formula ϕ of ℒ, except for it containing one or more variables which are outside ℒ itself.

This formula can then be used to represent an infinite number of individual axioms in one statement.


Namely, each of these variables is allowed to take a specified range of values, most commonly WFFs.

Each WFF ψ that results from ϕ by a valid choice of values for all the variables is then an axiom of 𝒫.

=== Formal Proof ===
Let 𝒫 be a proof system for a formal language ℒ.


Let ϕ be a WFF of ℒ.

A formal proof of ϕ in 𝒫 is a collection of axioms and rules of inference of 𝒫 that leads to the conclusion that ϕ is a theorem of 𝒫.


The term formal proof is also used to refer to specific presentations of such collections.

For example, the term applies to tableau proofs in natural deduction."
Definition:Independent Proof System,System,"Let ℒ be a logical language.

Let ( R, +, ∘) be a ring.

Let 𝐀 = [ a ]_m n be an m × n matrix over R.

Let 𝐁 = [ b ]_n p be an n × p matrix over R.

Then the matrix product of 𝐀 and 𝐁 is written 𝐀𝐁 and is defined as follows.

Let 𝐀𝐁 = 𝐂 = [ c ]_m p.


Then:
:∀ i ∈[ 1  . . ]m, j ∈[ 1  . . ]p: c_i j = ∑_k  = 1^n a_i k∘ b_k j


Thus [ c ]_m p is the m × p matrix where each entry c_i j is built by forming the (ring) product of each entry in the i'th row of 𝐀 with the corresponding entry in the j'th column of 𝐁 and adding up all those products.


This operation is called matrix multiplication, and 𝐂 is the matrix product of 𝐀 with 𝐁.


It follows that matrix multiplication is defined whenever the first matrix has the same number of columns as the second matrix has rows.

Let λ𝐀 = 𝐂.

Then:
:∀ i ∈[ 1  . . ]m, j ∈[ 1  . . ]n: c_i j = λ a_i j

λ𝐀 is the scalar product of λ and 𝐀.


Thus 𝐂 = [ c ]_m n is the m × n matrix composed of the product of λ with the corresponding elements of 𝐀.

Let 𝐂 be a metacategory.

Let 𝒞 be any collection of objects of 𝐂.
