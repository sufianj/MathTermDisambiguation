Definition:Major (Euclidean),Major,"Let a, b ∈ℝ_>0 in the forms:
:a = ρ√(2)√(1 +  k √(1 + k^2))
:b = ρ√(2)√(1 -  k √(1 + k^2))

where:
: ρ is a rational number
: k is a rational number whose square root is irrational.


Then a + b is a major.


 "
Definition:Ellipse/Major Axis/Semi-Major Axis,Major,":

Consider an ellipse K.


A semi-major axis of K is either half of the major axis of K from its midpoint to its endpoint.


In the above diagram, O V_1 and O V_2 are the semi-major axes of K."
Definition:Lemniscate of Bernoulli/Major Axis,Major,"Consider the lemniscate of Bernoulli defined as the locus M described by the equation:
:P_1 M × P_2 M = ( P_1 P_2 2 )^2


:


The line P_1 P_2 is the major axis of the lemniscate.

Definition:Lemniscate of Bernoulli/Major Semiaxis,Major,"Consider the lemniscate of Bernoulli defined as the locus M described by the equation:
:P_1 M × P_2 M = ( P_1 P_2 2 )^2
where O is the point at the center where the branches cross.


:


Each of the lines O P_1 and O P_2 is a major semiaxis of the lemniscate.

Definition:Categorical Syllogism/Premises/Major Premise,Major,"The major premise of a categorical syllogism is conventionally stated first.

It is a categorical statement which expresses the logical relationship between the primary term and the middle term of the syllogism."
