Definition:Torsion Subgroup,Torsion,"Let G be an abelian group.


Its torsion subgroup T (   )G is the subgroup of all torsion elements."
Definition:Torsion Group,Torsion,"Let G be a group.


Then G is a torsion group  if and only if  all its elements are torsion elements."
Definition:Torsion Element of Module,Torsion,"Let R be a commutative ring with unity.

Let M be a unitary module over R.

Let m ∈ M.


Then m is a torsion element  if and only if  there exists a regular element a ∈ R with a m = 0."
Definition:Torsion Submodule,Torsion,"Let R be a commutative ring with unity.

Let M be a unitary module over R.


The torsion submodule T(M) of M is the submodule of all torsion elements of M."
