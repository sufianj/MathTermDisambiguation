:a fat horizontal wedge shape, to indicate the digit 10
arranged in groups to indicate the digits 2 to 9 and 20 to 50.


:


At 59 the pattern stops, and the number 60 is represented by the digit 1 once again.

Thus these groupings were placed side by side:

:the one to the left of that would indicate a number from 60 × 1 to 60 × 59
and so on, each grouping further to the left indicating another multiplication by 60


For fractional numbers there was no actual radix point. Instead, the distinction was inferred by context.


The fact that they had no symbol to indicate the zero digit means that this was not a true positional number system as such.

Definition:Set Intersection,Intersection,"Let S and T be sets.


The (set) intersection of S and T is written S ∩ T.

It means the set which consists of all the elements which are contained in both of S and T:

:x ∈ S ∩ T  x ∈ S  x ∈ T

or, more formally:

:A = S ∩ T ∀ z: ( z ∈ A  z ∈ S  z ∈ T )


We can write:

:S ∩ T := { x: x ∈ S  x ∈ T }

and can voice it S intersect T.


It can be seen that, in this form, ∩ is a binary operation which acts on sets.


One often says that two sets intersect  if and only if  they have non-empty intersection.


=== Set of Sets ===
Let S be a set of sets.

The intersection of S is:
:⋂ S := { x: ∀ S ∈ S: x ∈ S }

Then the intersection of ⟨ S_i ⟩ is defined as:

:⋂_i ∈ I S_i := { x: ∀ i ∈ I: x ∈ S_i }


=== In the context of the Universal Set ===

In treatments of set theory in which the concept of the universal set is recognised, this can be expressed as follows.

Let 𝕌 be a universal set.

Let I be an indexing set.

Let ⟨ S_i ⟩_i ∈ I be an indexed family of subsets of 𝕌.


Then the intersection of ⟨ S_i ⟩ is defined and denoted as:

:⋂_i ∈ I S_i := { x ∈𝕌: ∀ i ∈ I: x ∈ S_i }

=== Subsets of General Set ===
This definition is the same when the universal set 𝕌 is replaced by any set X, which may or may not be a universal set:

Let I be an indexing set.

Let ⟨ S_i ⟩_i ∈ I be an indexed family of subsets of a set X.


Then the intersection of ⟨ S_i ⟩ is defined as:

:⋂_i ∈ I S_i := { x ∈ X: ∃ i ∈ I: x ∈ S_i }
where i is a bound variable.

=== Countable Intersection ===
Let 𝕊 be a set of sets.

Let ⟨ S_n ⟩_n ∈ℕ be a sequence in 𝕊.

Let S be the intersection of ⟨ S_n ⟩_n ∈ℕ:
:S = ⋂_n ∈ℕ S_n


Then S is a countable intersection of sets in 𝕊.

=== Finite Intersection ===
Let S = S_1 ∩ S_2 ∩…∩ S_n.

Then:
:S = ⋂_i ∈ℕ^*_n S_i := { x: ∀ i ∈ℕ^*_n: x ∈ S_i }
where ℕ^*_n = { 1, 2, 3, …, n }.


If it is clear from the context that i ∈ℕ^*_n, we can also write ⋂_ℕ^*_n S_i."

=== Riemann Integral ===
Let [ a  . . ]b be a closed real interval.

Let f: [ a  . . ]b →ℝ be a real function.

Let Δ be a finite subdivision of [ a  . . ]b, Δ = { x_0, …, x_n }, x_0 = a and x_n = b.

Let there for Δ be a corresponding sequence C of sample points c_i, C = ( c_1, …, c_n ), where c_i ∈[ x_i - 1 . . ]x_i for every i ∈{ 1, …, n }.

Let H ⊆ S.


=== Definition from Closure and Interior ===
Let T = ( S, τ) be a topological space.

Let H ⊆ S.


The boundary of H consists of all the points in the closure of H which are not in the interior of H.

Thus, the boundary of H is defined as:
:∂ H := H^- ∖ H^∘

=== Definition from Neighborhood ===

x ∈ S is a boundary point of H  if and only if  every neighborhood N of x satisfies:

The boundary of H consists of all the boundary point of H.

=== Definition from Intersection of Closure with Closure of Complement ===
Let T = ( S, τ) be a topological space.

Let H ⊆ S.


The boundary of H is the intersection of the closure of H with the closure of the complement of H in T:

=== Definition from Closure and Exterior ===
Let T = ( S, τ) be a topological space.

In the above digraph, the vertices are v_1, v_2, v_3 and v_4.


=== Arc ===
Let G = ( V, E ) be a digraph.

The arcs are the elements of E.

Informally, an arc is a line that joins one vertex to another.


If e ∈ E is an arc joining the vertex u to the vertex v, it is denoted u v.


=== Endvertex ===
Let D = ( V, E ) be a digraph.

Let e = u v be an arc of D, that is, e ∈ E.


The endvertices of e are the vertices u and v.


=== Initial Vertex ===
Let D = ( V, E ) be a digraph.

Let e = u v be an arc of D, that is, e ∈ E.


The initial vertex of e is the endvertex u which e is incident from.

=== Final Vertex ===
Let D = ( V, E ) be a digraph.

Let e = u v be an arc of D, that is, e ∈ E.


The final vertex of e is the endvertex v which e is incident to.

In the above graph, the arcs are v_1 v_2, v_2 v_4, v_4 v_3, v_4 v_1 and v_1 v_4.


As can be seen, in this general definition it is allowable for an arc to go in both directions between a given pair of vertices.


=== Formal Definition ===



A directed graph or digraph D is a non-empty set V together with an antireflexive relation E on V.

The elements of E are the arcs.


Thus the above digraph can be defined as:

::E = {( v_1, v_2 ), ( v_2, v_4 ), ( v_4, v_3 ), ( v_4, v_1 ), ( v_1, v_4 )  }

=== Symmetric Digraph ===
Let D = ( V, E ) be a digraph such that the relation E in D is symmetric.

Then D is called a symmetric digraph.


It follows from the definition of a (simple) graph that a symmetric digraph is in fact the same thing as an undirected graph.

=== Simple Digraph ===
Let D = ( V, E ) be a digraph.

If the relation E in D is also specifically asymmetric, then D is called a simple digraph.

That is, in a simple digraph there are no pairs of arcs (like there are between v_1 and v_4 in the diagram above) which go in both directions between two vertices."

Consider an annulus A; that is, a domain whose boundary consists of two Jordan curves.

Then the modulus A is the extremal length of the family of curves in A that connect the two boundary components of A.

Equivalently, there is a round annulus Ã = { z ∈ℂ: r < | z | < R } that is conformally equivalent to A.

Then:
:A :=  1 2 πln(   ) R r

The modulus of A can also be denoted M (   )R."

Definition:Valid Argument,Valid,"A valid argument is a logical argument in which the premises provide conclusive reasons for the conclusion.

* The conclusion is drawn from the premises;
* The conclusion is deduced from the premises;

If all the premises of a valid argument are true, then the conclusion must also therefore be true.

It is not possible for the premises of a valid argument to be true, but for the conclusion to be false.

A proof is a valid argument whose premises are all true.


Hence a valid argument that has one or more false premises is not a proof.


Suppose P is a proposition whose truth or falsehood is to be determined.

Constructing a valid argument upon a set of premises, all of which have previously been established as being true, is called proving P.

Hence, for any angle α (whether less than a right angle or not), the complement of α is π 2 - α.

If α is the complement of β, then it follows that β is the complement of α.

From Sine and Cosine are Periodic on Reals, it follows that if θ is an argument of z, then so is θ + 2 k π where k ∈ℤ is any integer.


Thus, the argument of a complex number z is a continuous multifunction.

 


=== Principal Range ===
It is understood that the argument of a complex number z is unique only up to multiples of 2 k π.

With this understanding, we can limit the choice of what θ can be for any given z by requiring that θ lie in some half open interval of length 2 π.

The most usual of these are:
:[ 0  . . )2 π
:( -π . . ]π

but in theory any such interval may be used.

This interval is known as the principal range.

=== Principal Argument ===
Let R be the principal range of the complex numbers ℂ.

The unique value of θ in R is known as the principal argument, of z.

This is denoted Arg( z ).

Note the capital A.

The standard practice is for R to be ( -π . . ]π.

This ensures that the principal argument is continuous on the real axis for positive numbers.

Thus, if z is represented in the complex plane, the principal argument Arg( z ) is intuitively defined as the angle which z yields with the real (y = 0) axis.


 "
Definition:Logical Argument,Argument,"A logical argument (or just argument) is a process of creating a new statement from one or more existing statements.

An argument proceeds from a set of premises to a conclusion, by means of logical implication, via a procedure called logical inference.


An argument may have more than one premise, but only one conclusion.


While statements may be classified as either true or false, an argument may be classified as either valid or invalid.


Loosely speaking, a valid argument is one that leads unshakeably from true statements to other true statements, whereas an invalid argument is one that can lead you to, for example, a false statement from one which is true.


Thus:
:An argument may be valid, even though its premises are false.
:An argument may be invalid, even though its premises are true.
:An argument may be invalid and its premises false.

It is even possible for the conclusion of an argument to be true, even though the argument is invalid and its premises are false.


To be sure of the truth of a conclusion, it is necessary to make sure both that the premises are true and that the argument is valid.


However, while you may not actually know whether a statement is true or not, you can investigate the consequences of it being either true or false, and see what effect that has on the truth value of the proposition(s) of which it is a part. That, in short, is what the process of logical argument consists of.


An argument may be described symbolically by means of sequents, which specify the flow of an argument.


=== Finitary Argument ===
A finitary argument is a logical argument which starts with a finite number of axioms, and can be translated into a finite number of statements."
Definition:Preimage/Mapping/Element,Argument,"Let f: S → T be a mapping.

The preimage of an element t ∈ T is defined as:

:f^-1(   )t := { s ∈ S: f (   )s = t }


This can also be expressed as:
:f^-1(   )t := { s ∈Img( f^-1): ( t, s ) ∈ f^-1}

=== Elementary Knot ===
Circle knots can often be quite wild and unwieldy - most of modern knot theory concerns itself with a specific kind of knot.

These knots are described as a finite set of points in ℝ^3 called { x_1, x_2, …, x_n }, together with line segments from x_i to x_i + 1 and a line segment from x_n to x_1.

The union of all these line segments is clearly a circle knot, or an unknot, an embedding of the circle which is homotopic to a circle.

Definition:Continued Product,Product,"Let ( S, ×) be an algebraic structure where the operation × is an operation derived from, or arising from, the multiplication operation on the natural numbers.

Let ( a_1, a_2, …, a_n ) ∈ S^n be an ordered n-tuple in S.


=== Definition by Index ===
Let ( S, ×) be an algebraic structure where the operation × is an operation derived from, or arising from, the multiplication operation on the natural numbers.

Let ( a_1, a_2, …, a_n ) ∈ S^n be an ordered n-tuple in S.


The composite is called the continued product of ( a_1, a_2, …, a_n ), and is written:

:∏_j  = 1^n a_j = ( a_1 × a_2 ×⋯× a_n )

=== Definition by Inequality ===
Let ( S, ×) be an algebraic structure where the operation × is an operation derived from, or arising from, the multiplication operation on the natural numbers.

Let ( a_1, a_2, …, a_n ) ∈ S^n be an ordered n-tuple in S.


The continued product of ( a_1, a_2, …, a_n ) can be written:
:∏_1 ≤ j ≤ n a_j = ( a_1 × a_2 ×⋯× a_n )

=== Definition by Propositional Function ===
Let ( S, ×) be an algebraic structure where the operation × is an operation derived from, or arising from, the multiplication operation on the natural numbers.

Let ( a_1, a_2, …, a_n ) ∈ S^n be an ordered n-tuple in S.


Let R (   )j be a propositional function of j.

Then we can write:

:∏_R (   )j a_j =  the product of all a_j such that R (   )j holds.


If more than one propositional function is written under the product sign, they must all hold.


Such an operation on an ordered tuple is known as a continued product.


Note that the definition by inequality form 1 ≤ j ≤ n is a special case of such a propositional function.

Also note that the definition by index form ∏_j  = 1^n is merely another way of writing ∏_1 ≤ j ≤ n.

Hence all instances of a continued product can be expressed in terms of a propositional function.


=== Iverson's Convention ===
Let ∏_R (   )j a_j be the continued product over all a_j such that j satisfies R.


This can also be expressed:
:∏_j ∈ℤ a_j^[ R (   )j ]
where [ R (   )j ] is Iverson's convention."
Definition:Cartesian Product,Product,"Let S and T be sets.


The cartesian product S × T of S and T is the set of ordered pairs ( x, y ) with x ∈ S and y ∈ T:

:S × T = {( x, y ): x ∈ S  y ∈ T }


Another way of defining it is by:

:( x, y ) ∈ S × T  x ∈ S, y ∈ T

More specifically:
:∀ p: ( p ∈ S × T ∃ x: ∃ y: x ∈ S  y ∈ T  p = ( x, y )  )


S × T can be voiced S cross T.


=== Class Theory ===
Let A and B be classes.


The cartesian product A × B of A and B is the class of ordered pairs ( x, y ) with x ∈ A and y ∈ B:

:A × B = {( x, y ): x ∈ A  y ∈ B }


Thus:
:∀ p: ( p ∈ A × B ∃ x: ∃ y: x ∈ A  y ∈ B  p = ( x, y )  )


A × B can be voiced A cross B.

=== Diagram ===


=== Finite Cartesian Product ===
Let ⟨ S_n ⟩ be a sequence of sets. 

The (finite) cartesian product of ⟨ S_n ⟩ is defined as:

:∏_k  = 1^n S_k = {( x_1, x_2, …, x_n ): ∀ k ∈ℕ^*_n: x_k ∈ S_k }


It is also denoted S_1 × S_2 ×⋯× S_n.

Thus S_1 × S_2 ×⋯× S_n is the set of all ordered n-tuples ( x_1, x_2, …, x_n ) with x_k ∈ S_k.


In particular:
:∏_k  = 1^2 S_k = S_1 × S_2

=== Countable Cartesian Product ===

The same notation can be used to define the (countable) cartesian product of an infinite sequence:

Let ⟨ S_n ⟩_n ∈ℕ be an infinite sequence of sets. 

The cartesian product of ⟨ S_n ⟩ is defined as:

:∏_k  = 1^∞ S_k = {( x_1, x_2, …, x_n, …): ∀ k ∈ℕ: x_k ∈ S_k }


It defines the concept:
:S_1 × S_2 ×⋯× S_n ×⋯

Thus ∏_k  = 1^∞ S_k is the set of all infinite sequences ( x_1, x_2, …, x_n, …) with x_k ∈ S_k.

=== Family of Sets ===
Let I be an indexing set.

Let ⟨ S_i ⟩_i ∈ I be a family of sets indexed by I.

The cartesian product of ⟨ S_i ⟩_i ∈ I is the set of all families ⟨ s_i ⟩_i ∈ I with s_i ∈ S_i for each i ∈ I.


This can be denoted ∏_i ∈ I S_i or, if I is understood, ∏_i S_i."

Take the indexed supremum:

Suppose that there are no values of j for which Φ(   )j is true.

Then sup_Φ(   )j a_j is defined as being -∞.

This supremum is called a vacuous supremum.


This is because:
:∀ a ∈ℝ: sup{ a, -∞} = a

Definition:Tableau Proof (Formal Systems),Tableau,"A tableau proof for a proof system is a technique for presenting a logical argument in the form of a formal proof in a straightforward, standard form.

On  , the proof system is usually natural deduction.


A tableau proof is a sequence of lines specifying the order of premises, assumptions, inferences and conclusion in support of an argument.


Each line of a tableau proof has a particular format. It consists of the following parts:

* Line: The line number of the proof. This is a simple numbering from 1 upwards.
* Pool: The list of all the lines containing the pool of assumptions for the formula introduced on this line.
* Formula: The propositional formula introduced on this line.
* Rule: The justification for introducing this line. This should be the rule of inference being used to derive this line.
* Depends on: The lines (if any) upon which this line directly depends. For premises and assumptions, this field will be empty.


Optionally, a comment may be added to explicitly point out possible intricacies.

If any assumptions are discharged on a certain line, for the sake of clarity it is preferred that such be mentioned explicitly in a comment.


At the end of a tableau proof, the only lines upon which the proof depends may be those which contain the premises.

It allows one to specify that a logical formula should (temporarily) be regarded as being a single entity, being on the same level as a statement variable.

Typically, a formal language, in defining its formal grammar, ensures by means of parenthesis that all of its well-formed words are uniquely readable.


Generally, brackets are used to indicate that certain formulas are in parenthesis.

However, there are problems with the  . If we allow it to be used without any restrictions at all, paradoxes arise, the most famous example probably being Russell's Paradox.

Definition:Line/Segment,Segment,"A line segment is any line (straight or not) which terminates at two points.


=== Straight Line Segment ===
A straight line segment is a line segment which is straight.


 
:A straight line segment can be drawn joining any two points.
 


Thus a definition for straight line which is frequently encountered is:
:A straight line is the shortest distance between two points.
This is all very well but it assumes that the line in question terminates at two particular endpoints.

=== Endpoint ===
Each of the points at either end of a line segment is called an endpoint of that line segment.

Similarly, the point at which an infinite half-line terminates is called the endpoint of that line.

where:
:s = ⌊ x ⌋, the floor of x
:it is not the case that there exists m ∈ℕ such that d_M = 9 for all M ≥ m.
(That is, the sequence of digits does not end with an infinite sequence of 9s.)


=== Decimal Point ===
Let x ∈ℝ have a decimal expansion:
:n. d_1 d_2 d_3 …


The dot that separates the integer part from the fractional part of x is called the decimal point.

That is, it is the radix point when used specifically for a base 10 representation.

A number x such that | x | < 1 has a units digit which is zero.

Such a number may be expressed either with or without the zero, for example:
:0  568

Definition:Basis Expansion,Expansion,"=== Positive Real Numbers ===
Let x ∈ℝ be a real number such that x ≥ 0.

b ( x - ⌊ x ⌋)     : n = 1 

b ( f_n - 1 - ⌊ f_n - 1⌋)     : n > 1

Then we define:
:∀ n ∈ℕ: n ≥ 1: ⟨ d_n ⟩ = ⌊ f_n ⌋


It follows from the method of construction and the definition of the floor function that:

:∀ n: 0 ≤ f_n < b and hence ∀ n: 0 ≤ d_n ≤ b - 1
:∀ n: f_n = 0  f_n + 1 = 0 and hence d_n + 1 = 0.


Hence we can express x = ⌊ x ⌋ + ∑_j ≥ 1d_j/b^j as:
:[ s  d_1 d_2 d_3 …]_b

:s = ⌊ x ⌋
:it is not the case that there exists m ∈ℕ such that d_M = b - 1 for all M ≥ m.

=== Partial Embedding ===

A common method of constructing isomorphisms and elementary embeddings in proofs is to recursively define them a finite number of elements at a time.  For this  purpose, it is useful to have a definition of embeddings using functions which are only defined on a subset of M:

A finite state machine operates as follows:

:(1): At the beginning, the current state s of the finite state machine is I.
:(2): One by one, the input (a sequence of symbols from x3a3) is fed into the machine.
:(3): After each input symbol σ, the current state s is set to the result of T(s, σ).

Category:Definitions/Abstract Machines"
Definition:Unlimited Register Machine,Machine,"An unlimited register machine, abbreviated URM, is an abstract machine with the following characteristics:


=== Registers ===
A URM has a sequence of registers which can store natural numbers: { 0, 1, 2, …}.

Any given URM program may make use of only a finite number of these registers.


Registers are usually referred to by the subscripted uppercase letters R_1, R_2, R_3, ….

The number held at any one time by a register is usually referred to by the corresponding lowercase letter r_1, r_2, r_3, ….


The registers are unlimited in the following two senses:
:(1): Although a URM program may make use of only a finite number of registers, there is no actual upper bound on how many a particular URM program can actually use.
:(2): There is no upper bound on the size of the natural numbers that may be stored in any register.


=== Index of Register ===
The subscript (which is a natural number) appended to a URM register is called the index of that register.

Hence, for example, the index of register R_5 is 5.

=== Program ===
The numbers held in the registers of a URM are manipulated according to a program.

A URM program is a finite sequence of basic instructions.


=== Basic Instruction ===
The basic instructions of a URM program form a finite sequence and hence can be considered a set indexed by the (positive) integer 1, 2, 3, ….


The basic instructions are as follows:


Name     	Notation          	Effect                     	Description
Zero     	Z (   )n        	0 → R_n                	Replace the number in R_n by 0.
Successor	S (   )n        	r_n + 1 → R_n          	Add 1 to the number in R_n.
Copy     	C (   )m, n   	r_m → R_n              	Replace the number in R_n by the number in R_m (leaving the one in R_m as it was).
Jump     	J (   )m, n, q	r_m = r_n ? ⇒ q	If the numbers in R_m and R_n are equal, go to instruction number q, otherwise go to the next instruction.



=== Execution ===
The operation of carrying out a basic URM instruction is referred to as execution.

=== Execution ===
The operation of carrying out a basic URM instruction is referred to as execution.

=== Line Number ===
For historical reasons, the index of an instruction in a given URM program is called its line number.

We can refer either to the line of the program or the line in the URM.

=== Set of All URM Programs ===
It is convenient to use U to stand for the set of all URM programs.

=== Length of Program ===
Let U denote the set of all URM programs.

Let P ∈ U be a URM program.

By definition, P is a finite sequence of basic instructions.


We define the function λ:  U →ℕ as follows:
:∀ P ∈ U: λ(   )P = the number of basic instructions that comprise P

Thus λ(   )P is referred to as the length of P.

=== Highest Register ===
Let U denote the set of all URM programs.

Let P ∈ U be a URM program.

By definition, P uses a finite number of registers.


We define the function ρ:  U →ℕ as follows:
:∀ P ∈ U: ρ(   )P = the highest register number used by P

That is, in any URM program P, no instruction refers to any register with index greater than ρ(   )P.

=== Highest Register ===
Let U denote the set of all URM programs.

Let P ∈ U be a URM program.

By definition, P uses a finite number of registers.


We define the function ρ:  U →ℕ as follows:
:∀ P ∈ U: ρ(   )P = the highest register number used by P

That is, in any URM program P, no instruction refers to any register with index greater than ρ(   )P.

=== Termination ===
A URM program terminates when there are no more instructions to execute.

This can happen in either of two ways:
:(1): If the program executes the last instruction, and this does not involve a Jump to an earlier instruction, the program will stop.
:(2): If the program executes a Jump instruction to a non-existent instruction, the program will stop.


=== Exit Jump ===
 

Such a Jump instruction is known as an exit jump .

=== Exit Line ===
 

The line on which a particular run of a URM program stops is called the exit line.


=== Endless Loop ===
 

If a URM program, when running, never reaches a state where it terminates, then it is said to be in an endless loop and will never terminate.

 

Note that whether a program terminates or not may depend on its input.

It may terminate perfectly well for one input, but go into an endless loop on another.

=== Input ===

The input to a URM program is:
:either an ordered k-tuple ( n_1, n_2, …, n_k ) ∈ℕ^k
:or a natural number n ∈ℕ.


In the latter case, it is convenient to consider a single natural number as an ordered 1-tuple ( n_1 ) ∈ℕ^1 = ℕ.

Hence we can discuss inputs to URM programs solely as instances of tuples, and not be concerned with cumbersome repetition for the cases where k = 1 and otherwise.


The convention usually used is for a URM program P to start computation with:
:the input (n_1, n_2, …, n_k) in registers R_1, R_2, …, R_k
:0 in all other registers used by P.


That is, the initial state of the URM is:
:∀ i ∈[ 1  . . ]k: r_i = n_i
:∀ i > k: r_i = 0.


It is usual for the input (either all or part) to be overwritten during the course of the operation of a program. That is, at the end of a program, R_1, R_2, …, R_k are not guaranteed still to contain n_1, n_2, …, n_k unless the program has been explicitly written so as to ensure that this is the case.


=== Output ===

At the end of the running of a URM program, the output will be found in register R_1.

=== Operation ===
When a URM runs a program, it always starts by executing the first instruction of the program.

When it has executed an instruction, it moves to the next instruction and executes that one, unless required otherwise by a Jump instruction.


=== Execution ===
The operation of carrying out a basic URM instruction is referred to as execution.

=== Instruction Pointer ===
The line number of the instruction which is currently about to be executed is known as the instruction pointer.

It can be imagined as a special-purpose register in the URM whose purpose is to hold that line number.

=== Stage of Computation ===
The stage of computation (or just stage) of a URM program is the count of how many instructions have been executed.

Thus each stage corresponds to the processing of one instruction.

=== State ===
The state of a URM program at a particular stage is defined as:
:(1): the value of the instruction pointer
:(2): the values contained by each of the registers that are used by the URM program.

=== Instruction Pointer ===
The line number of the instruction which is currently about to be executed is known as the instruction pointer.

It can be imagined as a special-purpose register in the URM whose purpose is to hold that line number.

=== Stage of Computation ===
The stage of computation (or just stage) of a URM program is the count of how many instructions have been executed.

=== State ===
The state of a URM program at a particular stage is defined as:
:(1): the value of the instruction pointer
:(2): the values contained by each of the registers that are used by the URM program.

=== Input ===

The input to a URM program is:
:either an ordered k-tuple ( n_1, n_2, …, n_k ) ∈ℕ^k
:or a natural number n ∈ℕ.


In the latter case, it is convenient to consider a single natural number as an ordered 1-tuple ( n_1 ) ∈ℕ^1 = ℕ.

Hence we can discuss inputs to URM programs solely as instances of tuples, and not be concerned with cumbersome repetition for the cases where k = 1 and otherwise.


The convention usually used is for a URM program P to start computation with:
:the input (n_1, n_2, …, n_k) in registers R_1, R_2, …, R_k
:0 in all other registers used by P.


That is, the initial state of the URM is:
:∀ i ∈[ 1  . . ]k: r_i = n_i
:∀ i > k: r_i = 0.


It is usual for the input (either all or part) to be overwritten during the course of the operation of a program. That is, at the end of a program, R_1, R_2, …, R_k are not guaranteed still to contain n_1, n_2, …, n_k unless the program has been explicitly written so as to ensure that this is the case.


=== Output ===

At the end of the running of a URM program, the output will be found in register R_1.


=== Null Program ===
The null URM program is a URM program which contains no instructions.

That is, a URM program whose length is zero."
Definition:Turing Machine,Machine,"A Turing machine is an abstract machine which works by manipulating symbols on an imaginary piece of paper by means of a specific set of algorithmic rules.

To simplify things, the piece of paper being worked on is in the form of a series of boxes on a one-dimensional ""tape"" divided into squares.

Each square can be either blank or can contain a symbol taken from a finite set, e.g. s_1, s_2, …, s_α.


The machine examines one square at a time, and carries out an action determined by both:
:(1): the symbol in the square
:(2): the current internal state of the machine.

The internal state of the machine is a way of providing a device that can keep track of the symbols in other squares.

There can be only a finite set of these states, say q_1, q_2, …, q_β.


The actions that the machine can take are as follows:
:(1): Replace the symbol in the square with another symbol
:(2): Move to examine the square in the immediate left of the current square being looked at
:(3): Move to examine the square in the immediate right of the current square being looked at.

After carrying out an action, the machine may change to a different internal state.


The program for the machine is a set of instructions which specify:
:(1): what action to take in some possible combinations of the internal state and symbol in the square currently being read
:(2): which internal state the machine moves into after carrying out that action.

Thus the instructions have the following form:
:q_i    s_j    A    q_t
which is interpreted as:

""If:
:* the machine is in internal state q_i
: the symbol in the square currently being examined is s_j
then:
: Carry out action A
: Move into internal state q_t.


The actions can be abbreviated to:
: L: Move one square to the left
: R: Move one square to the right
: s_k: Replace the symbol in the square currently being read with symbol s_k.


The computation stops when there is no instruction which specifies what should be done in the current combination of internal state and symbol being read.


=== Formal Definition ===

 

A Turing machine is a 7-tuple ( Q, x3a3, Γ, δ, q_0, B, F ) that satisfies the following:
* Q is a finite set, the states of the Turing machine.
* x3a3 is a finite set, the input symbols.
* Γ⊋x3a3 is a finite superset of the input symbols, called the tape symbols.
** For convenience, we also require that Γ and Q are disjoint.
* δ : Q ×Γ→ Q ×Γ×{ L, R } is a partial mapping, the transition function.
** L and R are arbitrary constants called directions.
* q_0 ∈ Q is a distinguished state called the start state.
* B ∈Γ is a distinguished tape symbol called the blank symbol. B must not be an element of x3a3.
* F ⊂ Q be a designated subset of the states called accepting states.


An instantaneous description of a Turing machine is a finite sequence of elements of Γ∪ Q, subject to the following conditions:
* There is exactly one element of Q in the sequence.
* The first entry in the sequence is not B.
* The last entry in the sequence is not in Q.
* If the last entry in the sequence is B, then the second-to-last is in Q.

By this definition, an instantaneous description can always be written as:
:X_m X_m-1… X_2 X_1 q Y Z_1 Z_2 … Z_n-1 Z_n
where m or n may be 0; X_i, Y, and Z_j are all elements of Γ; and q is an element of Q.

Additionally, X_m and Z_n are not B if they exist; that is, if m and n are not 0, respectively.


A move reduces one instantaneous description into another by applying the transition function.

We write A ⊢ B if a machine with instantaneous description A has, after a single move, instantaneous description B.

Let δ(   )q, Y = ( q', Y', d ).

Then there are seven cases to consider:

* If d = L and m > 0, and either n > 0 or Y' ≠ B then:
:X_m … X_2 X_1 q Y Z_1 … Z_n ⊢ X_m … X_2 q' X_1 Y' Z_1 … Z_n

* If d = L and m > 0, but n = 0 and Y' = B then:
:X_m … X_2 X_1 q Y ⊢ X_m … X_2 q' X_1

* If d = L but m = 0, and either n > 0 or Y' ≠ B then:
:q Y Z_1 … Z_n ⊢ q' B Y' Z_1 … Z_n

* If d = R and n > 0, and either m > 0 or Y' ≠ B then:
:X_m … X_1 q Y Z_1 Z_2 … Z_n ⊢ X_m … X_1 Y' q' Z_1 Z_2 … Z_n

* If d = R and n > 0, but m = 0 and Y' = B then:
:q Y Z_1 Z_2 … Z_n ⊢ q' Z_1 Z_2 … Z_n

* If d = R but n = 0, and either m > 0 or Y' ≠ B then:
:X_m … X_1 q Y ⊢ X_m … X_1 Y' q' B

* If m = 0, n = 0, and Y' = B then regardless of d:
:q Y ⊢ q' B


Let A ⊢^* B indicate that there exists a finite sequence ⟨ A_i ⟩_0 ≤ i ≤ n such that:
:A = A_0 ⊢ A_1 ⊢ A_2 ⊢…⊢ A_n = B


The language L (   )M accepted by the machine M is the set of strings w ∈x3a3^* for which, for some α, β∈Γ^* and p ∈ F:
:q_0 w ⊢^* α p β

As a special case, the null string is in the language  if and only if  the above holds for w = B.


A machine M halts on an input w, using the same special case for the null string as above,  if and only if  for some α, β∈Γ^*, X ∈Γ, and q ∈ Q:
:q_0 w ⊢^* α q X β
where δ(   )q, X is undefined."
Definition:Nondeterministic Turing Machine,Machine,"A nondeterministic Turing machine (NTM) is a variation of the classical Turing machine that relaxes the restriction that all the steps in the machine must be definite.

That is, given a single internal state and a single character being read on the tape the machine may have more than one possible response.

If any sequence of choices puts the machine into a halting state, then the machine stops after n steps, where n is the minimum number of steps needed to put the machine into a halting state.

 

=== Formal Definition ===

A nondeterministic Turing machine is a 7-tuple ( Q, x3a3, Γ, δ, q_0, B, F ) that satisfies the following:
* Q is a finite set, the states of the machine.
* x3a3 is a finite set, the input symbols.
* Γ⊋x3a3 is a finite superset of the input symbols, called the tape symbols.
** For convenience, we also require that Γ and Q are disjoint.
* δ : Q ×Γ→𝒫( Q ×Γ×{ L, R }) is a mapping, the transition function.
** L and R are arbitrary constants called directions.
* q_0 ∈ Q is a distinguished state called the start state.
* B ∈Γ is a distinguished tape symbol called the blank symbol. B must not be an element of x3a3.
* F ⊂ Q be a designated subset of the states called accepting states.


An instantaneous description of a nondeterministic Turing machine is a finite sequence of elements of Γ∪ Q, subject to the following conditions:
* There is exactly one element of Q in the sequence.
* The first entry in the sequence is not B.
* The last entry in the sequence is not in Q.
* If the last entry in the sequence is B, then the second-to-last is in Q.

By this definition, an instantaneous description can always be written as:

Additionally, X_m and Z_n are not B if they exist; that is, if m and n are not 0, respectively.


A move reduces one instantaneous description into another by applying the transition function. There may be many possible moves from any given instantaneous description.

We write A ⊢ B if a machine with instantaneous description A may have, after a single move, instantaneous description B.

Let ( q', Y', d ) ∈δ(   )q, Y.

:∑_R (   )j a_j =  The sum of all a_j such that R (   )j holds.


If more than one propositional function is written under the summation sign, they must all hold.


Such an operation on an ordered tuple is known as a summation.


Note that the definition by inequality form 1 ≤ j ≤ n is a special case of such a propositional function.

Also note that the definition by index form ∑_j  = 1^n is merely another way of writing ∑_1 ≤ j ≤ n.

Hence all instances of a summation can be expressed in terms of a propositional function.


=== Iverson's Convention ===
Let ∑_R (   )j a_j be the summation over all a_j such that j satisfies R.


This can also be expressed:
:∑_j ∈ℤ a_j [ R (   )j ]
where [ R (   )j ] is Iverson's convention.

The conventional notation for x is a divisor of y is ""x | y"", but there is a growing trend to follow the notation ""x \ y"", as espoused by   etc.

From  :
:The notation 'm | n' is actually much more common than 'm \ n' in current mathematics literature. But vertical lines are overused – for absolute values, set delimiters, conditional probabilities, etc. – and backward slashes are underused. Moreover, 'm \ n' gives an impression that m is the denominator of an implied ratio. So we shall boldly let our divisibility symbol lean leftward.


An unfortunate unwelcome side-effect of this notational convention is that to indicate non-divisibility, the conventional technique of implementing / through the notation looks awkward with \, so \ is eschewed in favour of ∤.


Some sources use | -10mu  3pt - or similar to denote non-divisibility.
