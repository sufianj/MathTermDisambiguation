Definition:Quintal System,System,"A quintal system  is a number system in which the base is 5.


=== Quintal Notation ===
Quintal notation is the positional number system whose base is 5.

That is, every number x ∈ℝ is expressed in the form:
:x = ∑_j ∈ℤ r_j 5^j
where:
:∀ j ∈ℤ: r_j ∈{ 0, 1, 2, 3, 4 }"
Definition:Decimal System,System,"A decimal system  is a number system in which the base is 10.


=== Decimal Notation ===
Decimal notation is the quotidian technique of expressing numbers in base 10.

Every number x ∈ℝ is expressed in the form:
:x = ∑_j ∈ℤ r_j 10^j
where:
:∀ j ∈ℤ: r_j ∈{ 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 }

=== Decimal System of Measurement ===
A decimal system (of measurement) is a system of measurement in which the standard multiples and fractions of the units of measurement are powers of 10."
Definition:Vigesimal System,System,"A vigesimal system is a number system in which the base is 20.


In conventional base 20 notation, every number x ∈ℝ is expressed in the form:
:x = ∑_j ∈ℤ r_j 20^j
where:
:∀ j ∈ℤ: r_j ∈{ 0, 1, …, 19 }"
Definition:Sexagesimal System,System,A sexagesimal system is a number system in which the base is 60.
Definition:Golden Mean Number System,System,"The golden mean number system is a system for representing a non-negative real number x by a sequence of zeroes and  ones using the golden mean ϕ as a number base.


=== Equivalent Representations ===
Let x ∈ℝ_≥ 0 have two representations S_1 and S_2 in the golden mean number system.

Then S_1 and S_2 are equivalent representations.


Category:Definitions/Golden Mean Number System

=== Simplest Form ===
Let x ∈ℝ_≥ 0 have a representation S in the golden mean number system.

Then S is the simplest form for x  if and only if :

:(1): No two adjacent 1s appear in S
:(2):    S does not end with the infinite sequence … 010101 …

=== Simplification ===
Consider the golden mean number system.

Let x ∈ℝ_≥ 0 have a representation which includes the string 011, say:
:x = p011q

where p and q are strings in {0, 1}.


From 100 in Golden Mean Number System is Equivalent to 011, x can also be written as:
:x = p100q


The expression p100q is a simplification of p011q.

=== Expansion ===
Consider the golden mean number system.

Let x ∈ℝ_≥ 0 have a representation which includes the string 100, say:
:x = p100q

where p and q are strings in {0, 1}.


From 100 in Golden Mean Number System is Equivalent to 011, x can also be written as:
:x = p011q


The expression p011q is an expansion of p011q."
Definition:Factorial Number System,System,The factorial number system is a mixed radix positional number system in which the digit in the ith column from the right is of base i.
Definition:Combinatorial Number System,System,"The combinatorial number system is a system for representing a positive integer m by a sequence of digits which are the upper coefficient of a sequence of n binomial coefficients for some n ∈ℤ_>0:

:m := k_1 k_2 k_3 … k_n

where:
:m = k_1 1 + k_2 2 + k_3 3 + ⋯ + k_n n
:0 ≤ k_1 < k_2 < ⋯ < k_n"
Definition:Zeckendorf Representation,System,"Zeckendorf representation is a system for representing a positive integer m by a sequence of digits which are the indices of a sequence of r Fibonacci numbers:

:n := k_1 k_2 k_3 … k_r

where:
:n = F_k_1 + F_k_2 + F_k_3 + ⋯ + F_k_r
:k_1 ≫ k_2 ≫ k_3 ≫⋯≫ k_r ≫ 0

where n ≫ k denotes that n ≥ k + 2."
Definition:Number-Naming System,System,"There are various number-naming systems for naming large numbers (that is: greater than 1   000   000).


=== Short Scale ===
The short scale system is the number-naming system which uses:
:the word million for 10^6 = 1   000   000
:the Latin-derived prefixes bi-, tri-, quadri-, quint-, etc. for each further multiple of 1   000, appended to the root -(i)llion, corresponding to the indices 2, 3, 4, 5, …


Thus:

 
 
 
 
 
 

Thus one n-illion equals 1000 × 10^3 n or 10^3 n + 3

=== Long Scale ===
The long scale system is the number-naming system which uses:
:the word million for 10^6 = 1   000   000
:the Latin-derived prefixes bi-, tri-, quadri-, quint-, etc. for each further multiple of 1   000   000, appended to the root -(i)llion, corresponding to the indices 2, 3, 4, 5, …


Thus:

 
 
 
 
 
 

Thus one n-illion equals 10^6 n.


Additional terms are occasionally found to fill some of the gaps, but these are rare nowadays:
