Definition:Complex Number,Complex,"
=== Informal Definition ===
A complex number is a number in the form a + b i or a + i b where:
:a and b are real numbers
:i is a square root of -1, that is, i = √(-1).

=== Formal Definition ===
A complex number is an ordered pair ( x, y ) where x, y ∈ℝ are real numbers, on which the operations of addition and multiplication are defined as follows:


=== Complex Addition ===
Let ( x_1, y_1 ) and ( x_2, y_2 ) be complex numbers.

Then + is a binary operation defined as:

:( x_1, y_1 ) + ( x_2, y_2 ):= ( x_1 + x_2, y_1 + y_2 )

=== Complex Multiplication ===
Let ( x_1, y_1 ) and ( x_2, y_2 ) be complex numbers.


Then ( x_1, y_1 ) ( x_2, y_2 ) is defined as:

:( x_1, y_1 ) ( x_2, y_2 ) := ( x_1 x_2 - y_1 y_2, x_1 y_2 + y_1 x_2 )

=== Scalar Product ===
Let ( x, y ) be a complex number.

Let m ∈ℝ be a real number.


Then m ( x, y ) is defined as:

:m ( x, y ) := ( m x, m y )

=== Construction from Cayley-Dickson Construction ===
The complex numbers can be defined by the Cayley-Dickson construction from the set of real numbers ℝ.

From Real Numbers form Algebra, ℝ forms a nicely normed *-algebra.

Let a, b ∈ℝ.

Then ( a, b ) ∈ℂ, where:

:( a, b ) ( c, d ) = ( a c - d b, a d + c b )
:( a, b )  = ( a, -b )
where:
:a is the conjugate of a
and 
:( a, b ) is the conjugation operation on ℂ.

From Real Numbers form Algebra, a = a and so the above translate into:

:( a, b ) ( c, d ) = ( a c - d b, a d + c b )
:( a, b )  = ( a, -b )


It is clear by direct comparison with the formal definition that this construction genuinely does generate the complex numbers."
Definition:Complex Function,Complex,"A complex function is a function whose domain and codomain are subsets of the set of complex numbers ℂ.


=== Independent Variable ===
Let f: ℂ→ℂ be a complex function.

Let f (   )z = w.


Then z is referred to as an independent variable (of f).

=== Dependent Variable ===
Let f: ℂ→ℂ be a complex function.

Let f (   )z = w.


Then w is referred to as the dependent variable (of f)."
Definition:Complex Conjugate,Complex,"Let z = a + i b be a complex number.


Then the (complex) conjugate of z is denoted z and is defined as:

:z := a - i b


That is, you get the complex conjugate of a complex number by negating its imaginary part.


=== Complex Conjugation ===
The operation of complex conjugation is the mapping:
: ·: ℂ→ℂ: z ↦z.
where z is the complex conjugate of z.


That is, it maps a complex number to its complex conjugate.

Definition:Subset Product,Complex,"Let ( S, ∘) be an algebraic structure.


We can define an operation on the power set 𝒫( S ) as follows:

:∀ A, B ∈𝒫( S ): A ∘_𝒫 B = { a ∘ b: a ∈ A, b ∈ B }


This is called the operation induced on 𝒫( S ) by ∘, and A ∘_𝒫 B is called the subset product of A and B.


It is usual to write A ∘ B for A ∘_𝒫 B.


=== Subset Product with Singleton ===

When one of the subsets in a subset product is a singleton, we can (and often do) dispose of the set braces. Thus:
Let ( S, ∘) be an algebraic structure.


Let A ⊆ S be a subset of S.

Then:
:(1):    a ∘ S := { a }∘ S
:(2):    S ∘ a := S ∘{ a }

where { a }∘ S and S ∘{ a } denote the subset product of { a } with S.


That is:
:a ∘ S = { a ∘ s: s ∈ S }
:S ∘ a = { s ∘ a: s ∈ S }"

Definition:Indexing Set/Term,Term,"Let I and S be sets.

Let x: I → S be a mapping.

Let x_i denote the image of an element i ∈ I of the domain I of x.

Let ⟨ x_i ⟩_i ∈ I denote the set of the images of all the element i ∈ I under x.


The image of x at an index i is referred to as a term of the (indexed) family, and is denoted x_i.


=== Notation ===
The family of elements x of S indexed by I is often seen with one of the following notations:

:⟨ x_i ⟩_i ∈ I

:( x_i )_i ∈ I

:{ x_i }_i ∈ I


There is little consistency in the literature, but ( x_i )_i ∈ I is perhaps most common.

The preferred notation on   is ⟨ x_i ⟩_i ∈ I.

The subscripted i ∈ I is often left out, if it is obvious in the particular context.


Note the use of x_i to denote the image of the index i under the indexing function x.

As x is actually a mapping, one would expect the conventional notation x (   )i.

However, this is generally not used, and x_i is used instead.

Let ℕ denote the natural numbers.


For each m ∈ℕ, recursively define e_m: ℕ→ℕ to be the mapping:
:e_m (   )n =  1     : n = 0 
 m × e_m (   )x     : n = x + 1
where:
:+ denotes natural number addition.
:× denotes natural number multiplication.


e_m (   )n is then expressed as a binary operation in the form:
:m^n := e_m (   )n

and is called m to the power of n.

=== Integers ===

Let m ∈ℤ be an integer.

Let y = √(x) be the mth root of x.


Then we can write y = x^1/m which means the same thing as y = √(x).


Thus we can define the power to a positive rational number:

Let r =  p q ∈ℚ be a positive rational number where p ∈ℤ_≥ 0, q ∈ℤ_> 0.

Then x^r is defined as:
:x^r = x^p/q = ( √(x))^p = √(( x^p ) )


When r = -p q ∈ℚ: r < 0 we define:
:x^r = x^-p/q =  1 x^p/q
analogously for the negative integer definition.

=== Real Numbers ===
Let x ∈ℝ_>0 be a (strictly) positive real number.

Let r ∈ℝ be a real number.


We define x^r as:

:x^r := exp(   )r ln x
where exp denotes the exponential function.


This definition is an extension of the definition for rational r.

This follows from Logarithms of Powers and Exponential of Natural Logarithm: it can be seen that:
:∀ r ∈ℚ: exp(   )r ln x = exp(   )ln(   )x^r = x^r

 

=== Complex Numbers ===
Let z, k ∈ℂ be complex numbers.


z to the power of k is defined as the multifunction:

=== Power of Zero ===
Let r ∈ℝ be a real number.

(This includes the situation where r ∈ℤ or r ∈ℚ.)

When x=0, x^r is defined as follows:

:0^r =  1     : r = 0 
 0     : r > 0 
Undefined    : r < 0

This takes account of the awkward case 0^0: it is ""generally accepted"" that 0^0 = 1 as this convention agrees with certain general results which would otherwise need a special case."

=== Definition from Circle ===
=== First Quadrant ===
Consider a unit circle C whose center is at the origin of a cartesian plane.


:


Let P be the point on C in the first quadrant such that θ is the angle made by OP with the x-axis.

Let a tangent line be drawn to touch C at A = ( 1, 0 ).

Let OP be produced to meet this tangent line at B.


Then the secant of θ is defined as the length of OB.

=== Second Quadrant ===
Consider a unit circle C whose center is at the origin of a cartesian plane.


:


Let P be the point on C in the second quadrant such that θ is the angle made by OP with the x-axis.

Let a tangent line be drawn to touch C at A = ( 1, 0 ).

Let OP be produced to meet this tangent line at B.


Then the secant of θ is defined as the length of OB.

The Cartesian plane is a Cartesian coordinate system of 2 dimensions.

Construct an infinite straight line through O and P and call it the x-axis.


Identify the x-axis with the real number line such that:
:0 is identified with the origin O
:1 is identified with the point P

The orientation of the x-axis is determined by the relative positions of O and P.

It is conventional to locate P to the right of O, so as to arrange that:

:to the right of the origin, the numbers on the x-axis are positive
:to the left of the origin, the numbers on the x-axis are negative.


Construct an infinite straight line through O perpendicular to the x-axis and call it the y-axis.

Identify the point P' on the y-axis such that OP' = OP.

Identify the y-axis with the real number line such that:
:0 is identified with the origin O
:1 is identified with the point P'


The orientation of the y-axis is determined by the position of P' relative to O.

It is conventional to locate P' such that, if one were to imagine being positioned at O and facing along the x-axis towards P, then P' is on the left. 

Hence with the conventional orientation of the x-axis as horizontal and increasing to the right:

:going vertically ""up"" the page or screen from the origin, the numbers on the y-axis are positive
:going vertically ""down"" the page or screen from the origin, the numbers on the y-axis are negative.

 m × e_m (   )x     : n = x + 1

:x^n =  1     : n = 0

x^n + 1 x     : n < 0

=== Rational Numbers ===
Let x ∈ℝ be a real number such that x > 0.

Let m ∈ℤ be an integer.

Let y = √(x) be the mth root of x.


Then we can write y = x^1/m which means the same thing as y = √(x).


Thus we can define the power to a positive rational number:

Let r =  p q ∈ℚ be a positive rational number where p ∈ℤ_≥ 0, q ∈ℤ_> 0.

Then x^r is defined as:
:x^r = x^p/q = ( √(x))^p = √(( x^p ) )


When r = -p q ∈ℚ: r < 0 we define:
:x^r = x^-p/q =  1 x^p/q
analogously for the negative integer definition.

=== Real Numbers ===
Let x ∈ℝ_>0 be a (strictly) positive real number.

Let r ∈ℝ be a real number.


We define x^r as:

:x^r := exp(   )r ln x
where exp denotes the exponential function.


This definition is an extension of the definition for rational r.

This follows from Logarithms of Powers and Exponential of Natural Logarithm: it can be seen that:
:∀ r ∈ℚ: exp(   )r ln x = exp(   )ln(   )x^r = x^r

 

=== Complex Numbers ===
Let z, k ∈ℂ be complex numbers.


z to the power of k is defined as the multifunction:

:z^k := e^k ln( z )

where:
:e^z is the exponential function
:ln is the  natural logarithm multifunction.


=== Principal Branch ===
The principal branch of a complex number raised to a complex power is defined as:

:z^k = e^k Ln z

where Ln z is the principal branch of the natural logarithm.


=== Positive Real Base ===
Let t > 0 be a real number and let k be a complex number.


The principal branch of a positive real number raised to a complex power is defined as:

:t^k = e^k ln t

where ln is the natural logarithm of a positive real number.

:x^k := ∏_j  = 1^n x_j^k_j
where the powers on the   are integer powers.


Category:Definitions/Analysis

=== Power of Zero ===
Let r ∈ℝ be a real number.

(This includes the situation where r ∈ℤ or r ∈ℚ.)

When x=0, x^r is defined as follows:

:0^r =  1     : r = 0 
 0     : r > 0 
Undefined    : r < 0

This takes account of the awkward case 0^0: it is ""generally accepted"" that 0^0 = 1 as this convention agrees with certain general results which would otherwise need a special case."
