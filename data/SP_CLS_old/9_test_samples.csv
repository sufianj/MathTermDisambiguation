Definition:Boundary (Geometry),Boundary," 

For example, the endpoints of a line segment are its boundaries.


=== Containment ===
A geometric figure is said to be contained by its boundary or boundaries.

Definition:Boundary (Topology),Boundary,"Let T = ( S, τ) be a topological space.

Let H ⊆ S.


=== Definition from Closure and Interior ===
Let T = ( S, τ) be a topological space.

Let H ⊆ S.


The boundary of H consists of all the points in the closure of H which are not in the interior of H.

Thus, the boundary of H is defined as:
:∂ H := H^- ∖ H^∘
where H^- denotes the closure and H^∘ the interior of H.

=== Definition from Neighborhood ===
Let T = ( S, τ) be a topological space.

Let H ⊆ S.


 

x ∈ S is a boundary point of H  if and only if  every neighborhood N of x satisfies:
:H ∩ N ∅
and
:H∩ N ∅
where H is the complement of H in S.

The boundary of H consists of all the boundary point of H.

=== Definition from Intersection of Closure with Closure of Complement ===
Let T = ( S, τ) be a topological space.

Let H ⊆ S.


The boundary of H is the intersection of the closure of H with the closure of the complement of H in T:

:∂ H = H^- ∩( H)^-

=== Definition from Closure and Exterior ===
Let T = ( S, τ) be a topological space.

Let H ⊆ S.


The boundary of H consists of all the points in H which are not in either the interior or exterior of H.

Thus, the boundary of H is defined as:
:∂ H := H ∖( H^∘∪ H^e )
where:
:H^∘ denotes the interior of H
:H^e denotes the exterior of H."
Definition:Boundary (Graph Theory),Boundary,"=== Simple Graph ===
Let G = ( V, E ) be a simple graph.

Let v ∈ V be a vertex of G.


Then the boundary of v is the set of all vertices of G which are adjacent to v:
:B (   )v = { u ∈ V: { u, v }∈ E }"
Definition:Right (Direction),Right,"The direction right is that way:
:→"
Definition:Right Angle,Right,"A right angle is an angle that is equal to half of a straight angle.


=== Measurement of Right Angle ===
 "
Definition:Right Hand Side,Right,"In an equation:
:Expression 1 = Expression 2
the term Expression 2 is the right hand side."
Definition:Right-Total Relation,Right,"Let ℛ⊆ S × T be a relation.


Then ℛ is right-total  if and only if :
:∀ t ∈ T: ∃ s ∈ S: ( s, t ) ∈ℛ


That is,  if and only if  every element of T is related to by some element of S.


That is,  if and only if :
:Img( ℛ) = T
where Img( ℛ) denotes the image of ℛ."
Definition:Right Quasi-Reflexive Relation,Right,"Let ℛ⊆ S × S be a relation in S.


=== Definition 1 ===
Let ℛ⊆ S × S be a relation in S.


ℛ is right quasi-reflexive  if and only if :

:∀ x, y ∈ S: ( x, y ) ∈ℛ( y, y ) ∈ℛ

=== Definition 2 ===
Let ℛ⊆ S × S be a relation in S.


ℛ is right quasi-reflexive  if and only if :

:∀ y ∈Img( ℛ): ( y, y ) ∈ℛ

where Img( ℛ) denotes the image set of ℛ."
Definition:Euclidean Relation/Right-Euclidean,Right,"Let ℛ⊆ S × S be a relation in S.


ℛ is right-Euclidean  if and only if :

:( x, y ) ∈ℛ( x, z ) ∈ℛ( y, z ) ∈ℛ"
