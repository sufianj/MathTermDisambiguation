Sun et al. Journal of Inequalities and Applications ( 2015) 2015:256 Page 2 of 7 Theorem 𝐃 Letf be a transcendental meromorphic function in the complex plane. Let k be a positive integer. Let L⁢[f]=ak⁢f(k)+ak-1⁢f(k-1)+⋯+a0⁢f, where a0,a1,…,ak are small functions and aj(≢0)(j=1,2,…,k). For c≠0,∞, let F=fn⁢L⁢[f]-c, where n is a positive integer. Then, for n≥2,F=fn⁢L⁢[f]-c has infinitely many zeros. From Theorem D, we immediately obtain the following result. Corollary D Let f be a transcendental meromorphic function in the complex plane. Let c be a finite complex number such that c≠0. Let n,k be two positive integers. Then, for n≥1+1+4⁢k⁢(k+1)22⁢k,fn⁢f(k)-c has infinitely many zeros.

It is natural to ask whether Corollary D can be improved by the idea of sharing values similarly with Theorem C. In this paper we investigate the problem and obtain the following result.

Theorem 1 Let ℱ be a family of meromorphic functions in D. Let n,k be two positive integers such that n≥1+1+2⁢k⁢(k+1)22⁢k. Let a be a complex number such that a≠0. For each f∈ℱ,f has only zeros of multiplicity at least k. If fn⁢f(k) and gn⁢g(k) share a in D for every pair of functionsf,g∈ℱ, then ℱ is normal in D.

Remark 1 From Theorem 1, it is easy to see 1+1+4⁢k⁢(k+1)22⁢k≥2 for any positive integer k. Example 1 Let D={z:|z|<1},n,k∈N with n≥1+1+2⁢k⁢(k+1)22⁢k and n be a positive integer; for k=2, let

	
ℱ={fm⁢(z)=m⁢zk-1,z∈D,m=1,2,…}
	

Obviously, for any functions fm and gm in ℱ, we have fmn⁢fm(k)=0, obviously fmn⁢fm(k) and gmn⁢gm(k) share any a≠0 in D. But ℱ is not normal in D.

Example 2 Let D={z:|z|<1},n,k∈N with n≥1+1+2⁢k⁢(k+1)22⁢k and n is a positive integer, and let

	
ℱ={fm⁢(z)=em⁢z,z∈D,m=1,2,…}.
	

Obviously, for any fm and gm in ℱ, we have fmn⁢fm(k)=mk⁢e(m⁢n+m)⁢z, obviously fmn⁢fm(k) and gmn⁢gm(k) share 0 in D. But ℱ is not normal in D.

Example 3 Let D={z:|z|<1},n,k∈N with n≥1+1+2⁢k⁢(k+1)22⁢k, and n be a positive integer, let

	
ℱ={fm⁢(z)=m⁢(z+1m),z∈D,m=1,2,…}.
	

For functions fm and gm in ℱ, we have fm⁢fm′=m⁢z+1. Obviously fm⁢fm′ and gm⁢gm′ share 1 in D. But ℱ is not normal in D.

Sun et al. Journal of Inequalities and Applications ( 2015) 2015:256 Page 3 of 7 Remark 2 Example 1 shows that the condition that f has only zeros of multiplicity at least k is necessary in Theorem 1 . Example 2 shows that the condition a≠0 in Theorem 1 is inevitable. Example 3 shows that Theorem 1 is not true for n=1. 2 Lemmas In order to prove our theorem, we need the following lemmas. Lemma 2.1 (Zalcman’s lemma, see [6]) Let ℱ be a family of meromorphic functions in the unit disc Δ with the property that, for each f∈ℱ, all zeros of multiplicity are at least k. Suppose that there exists a number A≥1 such that |f(k)⁢(z)|≤A whenever f∈ℱ and f=0. If ℱ is not normal in Δ, then for 0≤α≤k, there exist: 1. a number r∈(0,1); 2. a sequence of complex numbers zn,|zn|<r; 3. a sequence of functions fn∈ℱ; 4. a sequence of positive numbers ρn→0+ such that gn⁢(ξ)=ρn-α⁢fn⁢(zn+ρn⁢ξ) ) locally uniformly converges (with respect to the spherical metric) to a non-constant meromorphic function g⁢(ξ) on ℂ, and, moreover, the zeros of g⁢(ξ) are of multiplicity at least k,g♯⁢(ξ)≤g♯⁢(0)=k⁢A+1. In particular, g has order at most 2 . Lemma 2.2 Let n,k be two positive integers such that n≥1+1+4⁢k⁢(k+1)22⁢k, and let a≠0 be a finite complex number. Iff is a rational but not a polynomial meromorphic function and f has only zeros of multiplicity at least k, then fn⁢f(k) - a has at least two distinct zeros. Proof If fn⁢f(k)-a has zeros and has exactly one zero. We set

	
f=A⁢(z-α1)m1⁢(z-α2)m2⁢⋯⁢(z-αs)ms(z-β1)n1⁢(z-β2)n2⁢⋯⁢(z-βt)nt,
	

where A is a non-zero constant. Because the zeros of f are at least k, we obtain mi≥k (i=1,2,…,s),nj≥1⁢(j=1,2,…,t). For simplicity, we denote

	
m1+m2+⋯+ms=m≥k⁢s,
n1+n2+⋯+nt=n≥t.
	

From (2.1), we obtain

	
f(k)=(z-α1)m1-k⁢(z-α2)m2-k⁢⋯⁢(z-αs)ms-k⁢g⁢(z)(z-β1)n1+k⁢(z-β2)n2+k⁢⋯⁢(z-βt)nt+k,
	

where g is a polynomial of degree at most k⁢(s+t-1). From (2.1) and (2.4), we obtain

	
fn⁢f(k)=An⁢(z-α1)M1⁢(z-α2)M2⁢⋯⁢(z-αs)Ms⁢g⁢(z)(z-β1)N1⁢(z-β2)N2⁢⋯⁢(z-βt)Nt=pq.
	

Here p and q are polynomials of degree M and N, respectively. Also p and q have no common factor, where Mi=(n+1)⁢mi-k and Nj=(n+1)⁢nj+k. By (2.2) and (2.3), we

Sun et al. Journal of Inequalities and Applications ( 2015) 2015:256 Page 4 of 7 deduce Mi=(n+1)⁢mi-k≥k⁢(n+1)-k=n⁢k,Nj=(n+1)⁢nj+k≥n+k+1. For simplicity, we denote

	deg⁡P	=M=∑i=1sMi+deg⁡(g)≥n⁢k⁢s+k⁢(s+t-1)	
		=(n⁢k⁢s+k⁢s)+k⁢(t-1)≥(n⁢k+k)⁢s,	
	deg⁡q	=N=∑j=1tNj≥(k+1+n)⁢t.	

Since fn⁢f(k)-a=0 has just a unique zero z0, from (2.5) we obtain

	
fn⁢f(k)=a+B⁢(z-z0)l(z-β1)N1⁢(z-β2)N2⁢⋯⁢(z-βt)Nt=pq.
	

By a≠0, we obtain z0≠αi⁢(i=1,…,s), where B is a non-zero constant. From (2.5), we obtain

	
[fn⁢f(k)]′=(z-α1)M1-1⁢(z-α2)M2-1⁢⋯⁢(z-αs)Ms-1⁢g1⁢(ξ)(z-β1)N1+1⁢⋯⁢(z-βt)Nt+1,
	

where g1⁢(ξ) is a polynomial of degree at most (k+1)⁢(s+t-1). From (2.8), we obtain

	
[fn⁢f(k)]′=(z-z0)l-1⁢g2⁢(z)(z-β1)N1+1⁢⋯+(z-βt)Nt+1
	

where g2⁢(ξ)=B⁢(l-N)⁢zt+B1⁢zt-1+⋯+Bt is a polynomial (B1,…,Bt are constants). Now we distinguish two cases. Case 1 . If l≠N, by (2.8), then we obtain deg⁡p≥deg⁡q. So M≥N. By (2.9) and (2.10), we obtain ∑i=1s(Mi-1)≤deg⁡g2=t. So M-s-deg⁡(g)≤t, and M≤s+t+deg(g)≤(k+1)(s+ t)-k<(k+1)(s+t). By (2.6) and (2.7), we obtain

	
M<(k+1)⁢(s+t)≤(k+1)⁢[Mn⁢k+k+Nn+k+1]≤(k+1)⁢[1n⁢k+k+1n+k+1]⁢M
	

By n≥1+1+4⁢k⁢(k+1)22⁢k, we deduce M<M, which is impossible. Case 2. If l=N, then we distinguish two subcases. Subcase 2.1. If M≥N, by (2.9) and (2.10), we obtain ∑i=1s(Mi-1)≤deg⁡g2=t. So M- s-deg⁡(g)≤t, and M≤s+t+deg⁡(g)≤(k+1)⁢(s+t)-k<(k+1)⁢(s+t), then we can proceed similarly to Case 1 . This is impossible.

Subcase 2.2. If M<N, by (2.9) and (2.10), we obtain l-1≤deg⁡g1≤(s+t-1)⁢(k+1), and then

	N=l	≤deg⁡g1+1≤(k+1)⁢(s+t)-k<(k+1)⁢(s+t)	
		≤(k+1)⁢[1n⁢k+k+1n+k+1]⁢N≤N.	

By n≥1+1+4⁢k⁢(k+1)22⁢k, we deduce N<N. This is impossible.

Sun et al. Journal of Inequalities and Applications ( 2015) 2015:256 Page 5 of 7 If fn⁢f(k)-a≠0 and we know f is rational but not a polynomial, then fn⁢f(k) also is rational but not a polynomial. At this moment, l=0 for (2.8), and proceeding as in Case 1 , we have a contradiction. Lemma 2.2 is proved. 3 Proof of Theorem 1 We may assume that D={|z|<1}. Suppose that ℱ is not normal in D. Without loss of generality, we assume that ℱ is not normal at z0=0. Then, by Lemma 2.1, there exist: 1. a number r∈(0,1); 2. a sequence of complex numbers zj,zj→0⁢(j→∞); 3. a sequence of functions fj∈ℱ; 4. a sequence of positive numbers ρj→0+ such that gj⁢(ξ)=ρj-kn+1⁢fj⁢(zj+ρj⁢ξ) converges uniformly with respect to the spherical metric to a non-constant meromorphic function g⁢(ξ) in C. Moreover, g⁢(ξ) is of order at most 2 . By Hurwitz’s theorem, the zeros of g⁢(ξ) are at least k multiple. On every compact subset of ℂ which contains no poles of g, we see that

	
fjn⁢(zj+ρj⁢ξ)⁢fj(k)⁢(zj+ρj⁢ξ)-a=gjn⁢(ξ)⁢(gj(k)⁢(ξ))-a
	

converges uniformly with respect to the spherical metric to gn⁢(ξ)⁢(g(k)⁢(ξ))-a. If gn⁢(ξ)⁢(g(k)⁢(ξ))≡a⁢(a≠0) and g has only zeros of multiplicity at least k, then g has no zeros. From the gn⁢g(k) having no zeros and the gn⁢(ξ)⁢(g(k)⁢(ξ))≡a, we know g has no poles. Because the g⁢(ξ) is a non-constant meromorphic function in ℂ and g has order at most 2 . We obtain g⁢(ξ)=ed⁢ξ2+h⁢ξ+c, where d,h,c are constants and d⁢h≠0. So gn⁢(ξ)⁢(g(k)⁢(ξ))≢a, which is a contradiction. When gn⁢(ξ)⁢(g(k)⁢(ξ))-a≠0,(a≠0), we distinguish three cases. Case 1. If g is a transcendental meromorphic function, by Corollary D, this is a contradiction.

Case 2. If g is a polynomial and the zeros of g⁢(ξ) are at least k multiple, and n≥ 1+1+4⁢k⁢(k+1)22⁢k, then gn⁢(ξ)⁢(g(k)⁢(ξ))-a=0 must have zeros, which is a contradiction. Case 3 . If g is a non-polynomial ration function, by Lemma 2.2, this is a contradiction. Next we will prove that gn⁢g(k)-a has just a unique zero. To the contrary, let ξ0 and ξ0* be two distinct solutions of gn⁢g(k)-a, and choose δ(>0) small enough such that D⁢(ξ0,δ)∩ D⁢(ξ0*,δ)=∅ where D⁢(ξ0,δ)={ξ:|ξ-ξ0|<δ} and D⁢(ξ0*,δ)={ξ:|ξ-ξ0*|<δ}. From (3.1), by Hurwitz’s theorem, there exist points ξj∈D⁢(ξ0,δ),ξj*∈D⁢(ξ0*,δ) such that for sufficiently large j,

	
fjn⁢(zj+ρj⁢ξj)⁢(fj(k)⁢(zj+ρj⁢ξj))-a=0,
fjn⁢(zj+ρj⁢ξj)⁢(fj(k)⁢(zj+ρj⁢ξj))-a=0.
	

By the hypothesis that for each pair of functions f and g in ℱ,fn⁢f(k) and gn⁢g(k) share a in D, we know that for any positive integer m

	
fmn⁢(zj+ρj⁢ξj)⁢(fm(k)⁢(zj+ρj⁢ξj))-a=0,
fmn⁢(zj+ρj⁢ξj)⁢(fm(k)⁢(zj+ρj⁢ξj))-a=0.
	




Sun et al. Journal of Inequalities and Applications (2015) 2015:256 Page 6 of 7 Fix m, take j→∞, and note zj+ρj⁢ξj→0,zj+ρj⁢ξj*→0, then

	
fmn⁢(0)⁢(fm(k)⁢(0))-a=0.
	

Since the zeros of fmn⁢(0)⁢(fm(k)⁢(0))-a have no accumulation point, so zj+ρj⁢ξj=0,zj+ ρj⁢ξj*=0 Hence

	
ξj=-zjρj,ξj*=-zjρj
	

This contradicts with ξj∈D⁢(ξ0,δ),ξj*∈D⁢(ξ0*,δ), and D⁢(ξ0,δ)∩D⁢(ξ0*,δ)=∅. So gn⁢g(k)-a has just a unique zero, which can be denoted by ξ0.

From the above, we know gn⁢g(k)-a has just a unique zero. If g is a transcendental meromorphic function, by Corollary D, then gn⁢g(k)-a=0 has infinitely many solutions, which is a contradiction.

From the above, we know gn⁢g(k)-a has just a unique zero. If g is a polynomial, then we set gn⁢g(k)-a=K⁢(z-z0)l, where K is a non-zero constant, l is a positive integer. Because the zeros of g⁢(ξ) are at least k multiple, and n≥1+1+2⁢k⁢(k+1)22⁢k, we obtain l≥3. Then [gn⁢g(k)]′= K⁢l⁢(z-z0)l-1⁢(l-1≥2). But [gn⁢g(k)]′ has exactly one zero, so gn⁢g(k) has the same zero z0 too. Hence gn⁢g(k)⁢(z0)=0, which contradicts gn⁢g(k)⁢(z0)=a≠0.

If g is a rational function but not a polynomial, by Lemma 2.2, then gn⁢g(k)-a=0 at least has two distinct zeros, which is a contradiction. Theorem 1 is proved. 4 Discussion In 2013, Yang and Nevo [4] has proved the following. Theorem E Let ℱ be a family of meromorphic functions in D,n be a positive integer and a,b be two constants such that a≠0,∞ and b≠∞.

Let L⁢[f]=ak⁢f(k)+ak-1⁢f(k-1)+⋯+a0⁢f, where a0,a1,…,ak are small functions and aj(≢0)(j=1,2,…,k). For c≠0,∞, let F=fn⁢L⁢[f]-c, where n is a positive integer. Then, for n≥2,F=fn⁢L⁢[f]-c has infinitely many zeros. From Theorem D, we immediately obtain the following result. Corollary D Let f be a transcendental meromorphic function in the complex plane. Let c be a finite complex number such that c≠0. Let n,k be two positive integers. Then, for n≥1+1+4⁢k⁢(k+1)22⁢k,fn⁢f(k)-c has infinitely many zeros.

From Corollary D, it is natural to ask whether Corollary D can be improved by the idea of sharing values similarly with Theorem C ? In this paper we investigate the problem and obtain the following result.

Theorem 1 Let ℱ be a family of meromorphic functions in D. Let n,k be two positive integers such that n≥1+1+4⁢k⁢(k+1)22⁢k. Let a be a finite complex number such that a≠0. If, for each f∈ℱ,f has only zeros of multiplicity at least k. If fn⁢f(k) and gn⁢g(k) share a in D for every pair of functions f,g∈ℱ, then ℱ is normal in D.

Remark 1 From Theorem 1, it is easy to see 1+1+4⁢k⁢(k+1)22⁢k≥2 for any positive integer k. Example 1 Let D={z:|z|<1},n,k∈N with n≥1+1+4⁢k⁢(k+1)22⁢k and n be a positive integer, for k=2, let

	
ℱ={fm⁢(z)=m⁢zk-1,z∈D,m=1,2,…}.
	

For any fm and gm in ℱ, we have fmn⁢fm(k)=0, obviously fmn⁢fm(k) and gmn⁢gm(k) share any a≠0 in D. But ℱ is not normal in D.

Example 2 Let D={z:|z|<1},n,k∈N with n≥1+1+4⁢k⁢(k+1)22⁢k and n be a positive integer, and let

	
ℱ={fm⁢(z)=em⁢z,z∈D,m=1,2,…}.
	

For any fm and gm in ℱ, we have fmn⁢fm(k)=mk⁢e(m⁢n+m)⁢z, obviously fmn⁢fm(k) and gmn⁢gm(k) share 0 in D. But ℱ is not normal in D.

Example 3 Let D={z:|z|<1},n,k∈N with n≥1+1+4⁢k⁢(k+1)22⁢k, and n be a positive integer, let

	
ℱ={fm⁢(z)=m⁢(z+1m),z∈D,m=1,2,…}.
	

For any fm and gm in ℱ, we have fm⁢fm′=m⁢z+1. Obviously fm⁢fm′ and gm⁢gm′ share 1 in D. But ℱ is not normal in D.

Yan and Ychussie Advances in Difference Equations ( 2015) 2015:226 Page 3 of 8 Remark 2 Example 1 shows that f has only zeros of multiplicity at least k is necessary in Theorem 1. Example 2 shows that a≠0 in Theorem 1 is inevitable. Example 3 shows that Theorem 1 is not true for n=1. 2 Lemmas In order to prove our theorem, we need the following lemmas. Lemma 2.1 Zalcman’s lemma (see [7,8] ) Let ℱ be a family of meromorphic functions in D with the property that for each f∈ℱ, all zeros are of multiplicity at least k. Suppose that there exists a number A≥1 such that |f(k)⁢(z)|≤A whenever f∈ℱ and f=0. If ℱ is not normal in D, then for 0≤α≤k, there exist (1) a number r∈(0,1); (2) a sequence of complex numbers zn,|zn|<r; (3) a sequence of functions fn∈ℱ; (4) a sequence of positive numbers ρn→0+; such that gn(ξ)=ρn-αfn(zn+ρnξ ) locally uniformly (with respect to the spherical metric) converges to a non-constant meromorphic function g⁢(ξ) on ℂ, and moreover, the zeros of g⁢(ξ) are of multiplicity at least k,g♯⁢(ξ)≤g♯⁢(0)=k⁢A+1, where g♯⁢(z)=|g′⁢(z)|1+|g⁢(z)|2.In particular, g has order at most 2.

Lemma 2.2 Let n,k be two positive integers such that n≥1+1+4⁢k⁢(k+1)22⁢k, and let a≠0 be a finite complex number. Iff is a rational but not a polynomial meromorphic function and f has only zeros of multiplicity at least k, then fn⁢f(k)-a has at least two distinct zeros. Proof If fn⁢f(k)-a has zeros and has exactly one zero. We set

	
f=A⁢(z-α1)m1⁢(z-α2)m2⁢⋯⁢(z-αs)ms(z-β1)n1⁢(z-β2)n2⁢⋯⁢(z-βt)nt,
	

where A is a non-zero constant. Because the zeros of f are at least k, we obtain mi≥k (i=1,2,…,s),nj≥1⁢(j=1,2,…,t). For simplicity, we denote

	
m1+m2+⋯+ms=m≥k⁢s
	

and

	
n1+n2+⋯+nt=n≥t.
	

From (2.1), we obtain

	
f(k)=(z-α1)m1-k⁢(z-α2)m2-k⁢⋯⁢(z-αs)ms-k⁢g⁢(z)(z-β1)n1+k⁢(z-β2)n2+k⁢⋯⁢(z-βt)nt+k,
	

where g is a polynomial of degree at most k⁢(s+t-1).

Yan and Ychussie Advances in Difference Equations ( 2015) 2015:226 Page 4 of 8 From (2.1) and (2.4), we obtain

	
fn⁢f(k)=An⁢(z-α1)M1⁢(z-α2)M2⁢⋯⁢(z-αs)Ms⁢g⁢(z)(z-β1)N1⁢(z-β2)N2⁢⋯⁢(z-βt)Nt=pq
	

where p and q are polynomials of degree M and N, respectively. Also p and q have no common factor, where Mi=(n+1)⁢mi-k and Nj=(n+1)⁢nj+k. By (2.2) and (2.3), we deduce Mi=(n+1)⁢mi-k≥k⁢(n+1)-k=n⁢k and Nj=(n+1)⁢nj+k≥n+k+1. For simplicity, we denote

	deg⁡p	=M=∑i=1sMi+deg⁡(g)≥n⁢k⁢s+k⁢(s+t-1)	
		=(n⁢k⁢s+k⁢s)+k⁢(t-1)≥(n⁢k+k)⁢s	
	deg⁡q	=N=∑j=1tNj≥(k+1+n)⁢t.	

and Since fn⁢f(k)-a=0 has just a unique zero z0, from (2.5) we obtain

By a≠0, we obtain z0≠αi⁢(i=1,…,s), where B is a non-zero constant. From (2.5), we obtain

	
[fn⁢f(k)]′=(z-α1)M1-1⁢(z-α2)M2-1⁢⋯⁢(z-αs)Ms-1⁢g1⁢(ξ)(z-β1)N1+1⁢⋯⁢(z-βt)Nt+1

By (2.9) and (2.10), we obtain ∑i=1s(Mi-1)≤deg⁡g2=t. So M-s-deg⁡(g)≤t and M≤s+t+deg(g)≤(k+1)(s+ t)-k<(k+1)(s+t). By (2.6) and (2.7), we obtain

	M	<(k+1)(s+t)≤(k+1)[Mn⁢k+k+	
		≤(k+1)⁢[1n⁢k+k+1n+k+1]⁢M	

By n≥1+1+4⁢k⁢(k+1)22⁢k, we deduce M<M, which is impossible.

Yan and Ychussie Advances in Difference Equations ( 2015) 2015:226 Page 5 of 8 Case 2 . If l=N, then we distinguish two subcases. Subcase 2.1. If M≥N, by (2.9) and (2.10), we obtain ∑i=1s(Mi-1)≤deg⁡g2=t. So M-s- deg⁡(g)≤t and M≤s+t+deg⁡(g)≤(k+1)⁢(s+t)-k<(k+1)⁢(s+t), then this is impossible, which is similar to Case 1 .

Subcase 2.2. If M<N, by (2.9) and (2.10), we obtain l-1≤deg⁡g1≤(s+t-1)⁢(k+1), then

	
N=l≤deg⁡g1+1≤(k+1)⁢(s+t)-k<(k+1)⁢(s+t)
	
	
≤(k+1)⁢[1n⁢k+k+1n+k+1]⁢N≤N
	

By n≥1+1+4⁢k⁢(k+1)22⁢k, we deduce N<N, which is impossible. If fn⁢f(k)-a≠0. We know f is rational but not a polynomial, then fn⁢f(k) is rational but not a polynomial. At this moment, l=0 for (2.8), proceeding as above in Case 1 , we have a contradiction. 3 Proof of Theorem 1 We may assume that D={|z|<1}. Suppose that ℱ is not normal in D. Without loss of generality, we assume that ℱ is not normal at z0=0. Then, by Lemma 2.1, there exist (1) a number r∈(0,1); (2) a sequence of complex numbers zj,zj→0⁢(j→∞); (3) a sequence of functions fj∈ℱ; (4) a sequence of positive numbers ρj→0+ such that gj⁢(ξ)=ρj-kn+1⁢fj⁢(zj+ρj⁢ξ) converges uniformly with respect to the spherical metric to a non-constant meromorphic function g⁢(ξ) in ℂ. Moreover, g⁢(ξ) is of order at most 2 . By Hurwitz’s theorem, the zeros of g⁢(ξ) are at least k multiple. On every compact subset of ℂ which contains no poles of g, we have

	
fjn⁢(zj+ρj⁢ξ)⁢fj(k)⁢(zj+ρj⁢ξ)-a=gjn⁢(ξ)⁢(gj(k)⁢(ξ))-a,
	

which converges uniformly with respect to the spherical metric to gn⁢(ξ)⁢(g(k)⁢(ξ))-a. If gn⁢(ξ)⁢(g(k)⁢(ξ))≡a(≠0) and g has only zeros of multiplicity at least k, then g has no zeros. From gn⁢g(k) having no zeros and gn⁢(ξ)⁢(g(k)⁢(ξ))≡a, we know that g has no poles. Because g⁢(ξ) is a non-constant meromorphic function in ℂ and g has order at most 2 , we obtain g⁢(ξ)=ed⁢ξ2+h⁢ξ+c, where d,h,c are constants and d⁢h≠0. So gn⁢(ξ)⁢(g(k)⁢(ξ))≢a, which is a contradiction. When gn⁢(ξ)⁢(g(k)⁢(ξ))-a≠0,(a≠0), we distinguish three cases. Case 1. If g is a transcendental meromorphic function, by Corollary D, this is a contradiction.

Case 2 . If g is a polynomial, the zeros of g⁢(ξ) are at least k multiple and n≥1+1+4⁢k⁢(k+1)22⁢k, then gn⁢(ξ)⁢(g(k)⁢(ξ))-a=0 must have zeros, which is a contradiction.

Case 3. If g is a non-polynomial rational function, by Lemma 2.2, which is a contradiction.

Next we will prove that gn⁢g(k)-a has just a unique zero. To the contrary, let ξ0 and ξ0* be two distinct solutions of gn⁢g(k)-a, and choose δ(>0) small enough such that D⁢(ξ0,δ)∩ D⁢(ξ0*,δ)=∅, where D⁢(ξ0,δ)={ξ:|ξ-ξ0|<δ} and D⁢(ξ0*,δ)={ξ:|ξ-ξ0*|<δ}. From (3.1), by

Yan and Ychussie Advances in Difference Equations ( 2015) 2015:226 Page 6 of 8 Hurwitz’s theorem, there exist points ξj∈D⁢(ξ0,δ),ξj*∈D⁢(ξ0*,δ) such that for sufficiently large j,

	
fjn⁢(zj+ρj⁢ξj)⁢(fj(k)⁢(zj+ρj⁢ξj))-a=0
	

and

	
fjn⁢(zj+ρj⁢ξj)⁢(fj(k)⁢(zj+ρj⁢ξj))-a=0.
	

By the hypothesis that for each pair of functions f and g in ℱ,fn⁢f(k) and gn⁢g(k) share a in D, we know for any positive integer m

	
fmn⁢(zj+ρj⁢ξj)⁢(fm(k)⁢(zj+ρj⁢ξj))-a=0
	

and

	
fmn⁢(zj+ρj⁢ξj)⁢(fm(k)⁢(zj+ρj⁢ξj))-a=0.
	

Fix m, take j→∞ and note zj+ρj⁢ξj→0,zj+ρj⁢ξj*→0, then we have

	
fmn⁢(0)⁢(fm(k)⁢(0))-a=0
	

Since the zeros of fmn⁢(0)⁢(fm(k)⁢(0))-a have no accumulation point, we have zj+ρj⁢ξj=0 and zj+ρj⁢ξj*=0 Hence

	
ξj=-zjρj,ξj*=-zjρj.
	

This contradicts with ξj∈D⁢(ξ0,δ),ξj*∈D⁢(ξ0*,δ) and D⁢(ξ0,δ)∩D⁢(ξ0*,δ)=∅. So gn⁢g(k)-a has just a unique zero, which can be denoted by ξ0.

From the above, we know gn⁢g(k)-a has just a unique zero. If g is a transcendental meromorphic function, by Corollary D, then gn⁢g(k)-a=0 has infinitely many solutions, which is a contradiction.

From the above, we know gn⁢g(k)-a has just a unique zero. If g is a polynomial, then we set gn⁢g(k)-a=K⁢(z-z0)l, where K is a non-zero constant and l is a positive integer. Because the zeros of g⁢(ξ) are at least k multiple and n≥1+1+4⁢k⁢(k+1)22⁢k, then we obtain l≥3. Then [gn⁢g(k)]′=K⁢l⁢(z-z0)l-1⁢(l-1≥2). But [gn⁢g(k)]′ has exactly one zero, so gn⁢g(k) has the same zero z0 too. Hence gn⁢g(k)⁢(z0)=0, which redcontradicts with gn⁢g(k)⁢(z0)=a≠0.

If g is a rational function but not a polynomial, by Lemma 2.2, then gn⁢g(k)-a=0 at least has two distinct zeros, which is a contradiction. 4 Discussion In 2013, Ren [9] proved the following theorem.

Let B⁢(P) denote the neighborhood of P and SR=B⁢(O,R) for simplicity. The unit sphere and the upper half unit sphere in 𝐑n are denoted by 𝐒1 and 𝐒1+, respectively. For simplicity, a point (1,Θ) on 𝐒1 and the set {Θ;(1,Θ)∈Γ} for a set Γ,Γ⊂𝐒1, are often identified with Θ and Γ, respectively. Let Λ×Γ denote the set {(r,Θ)∈𝐑n;r∈Λ,(1,Θ)∈Γ}, where Λ⊂𝐑+and Γ⊂𝐒1. We denote the set 𝐑+×𝐒1+={(X,xn)∈𝐑n;xn>0} by 𝐓n, which is called the half space. We shall also write h1≈h2 for two positive functions h1 and h2 if and only if there exists a positive constant a such that a-1⁢h1≤h2≤a⁢h1. We denote max⁡{u⁢(r,Θ),0} and max⁡{-u⁢(r,Θ),0} by u+⁢(r,Θ) and u-⁢(r,Θ), respectively. The set 𝐑+×Γ in 𝐑n is called a cone. We denote it by ℭn⁢(Γ), where Γ⊂𝐒1. The sets I×Γ and I×∂⁡Γ with an interval on 𝐑 are denoted by ℭn⁢(Γ;I) and 𝔖n⁢(Γ;I), respectively. We denote ℭn⁢(Γ)∩SR and 𝔖n⁢(Γ;(0,+∞)) by 𝔖n⁢(Γ;R) and 𝔖n⁢(Γ), respectively.

Furthermore, we denote by d⁢σ (resp. dSR) the (n-1)-dimensional volume elements induced by the Euclidean metric on ∂⁡ℭn⁢(Γ) (resp. SR ) and by d⁢w the elements of the Euclidean volume in 𝐑n. It is well known (see, e.g. [1], p.41) that Δ*⁢φ⁢(Θ)+λ⁢φ⁢(Θ)=0  in Γ, φ⁢(Θ)=0 on ∂⁡Γ, where Δ* is the Laplace-Beltrami operator.

Let B⁢(P) denote the neighborhood of P and SR=B⁢(O,R) for simplicity. The unit sphere and the upper half unit sphere in 𝐑n are denoted by 𝐒1 and 𝐒1+, respectively. For simplicity, a point (1,Θ) on 𝐒1 and the set {Θ;(1,Θ)∈Γ} for a set Γ,Γ⊂𝐒1, are often identified with Θ and Γ, respectively. Let Λ×Γ denote the set {(r,Θ)∈𝐑n;r∈Λ,(1,Θ)∈Γ}, where Λ⊂𝐑+and Γ⊂𝐒1. We denote the set 𝐑+×𝐒1+={(X,xn)∈𝐑n;xn>0} by 𝐓n, which is called the half space. We shall also write h1≈h2 for two positive functions h1 and h2 if and only if there exists a positive constant a such that a-1⁢h1≤h2≤a⁢h1. We denote max⁡{u⁢(r,Θ),0} and max⁡{-u⁢(r,Θ),0} by u+⁢(r,Θ) and u-⁢(r,Θ), respectively.

The set 𝐑+×Γ in 𝐑n is called a cone. We denote it by ℭn⁢(Γ), where Γ⊂𝐒1. The sets I×Γ and I×∂⁡Γ with an interval on 𝐑 are denoted by ℭn⁢(Γ;I) and 𝔖n⁢(Γ;I), respectively. We denote ℭn⁢(Γ)∩SR and 𝔖n⁢(Γ;(0,+∞)) by 𝔖n⁢(Γ;R) and 𝔖n⁢(Γ), respectively. Furthermore, we denote by d⁢σ (resp. dSR) the (n-1)-dimensional volume elements induced by the Euclidean metric on ∂⁡ℭn⁢(Γ) (resp. SR ) and by d⁢w the elements of the Euclidean volume in 𝐑n. It is known (see, e.g., [1], p.41) that Δ*⁢φ⁢(Θ)+λ⁢φ⁢(Θ)=0  in Γ, φ⁢(Θ)=0 on ∂⁡Γ, where Δ* is the Laplace-Beltrami operator. We denote the least positive eigenvalue of this boundary value problem (1.1) by λ and the normalized positive eigenfunction corresponding to λ by φ⁢(Θ),∫Γφ2⁢(Θ)⁢𝑑S1=1. ( ) The Author(s) 2017.

"Theorem 4.1. The system (2.1) is globally asymptotically stable at equilibrium point (x¯,y¯,z¯), where x<x¯,y>y¯ and z>z¯. Proof. Let us consider a suitable Lyapunov function

	
v⁢(x,y,z)=x+h⁢y+k⁢z
	

where h=1/c1 and k=1/c2. Obviously v is a positive definite. Now take the derivative from the last Lyapunov system with respect to the time t. So we have

	
d⁢vd⁢t=d⁢xd⁢t+h⁢d⁢yd⁢t+k⁢d⁢zd⁢t
	

By substituting d⁢x/d⁢t,d⁢y/d⁢t and d⁢z/d⁢t in the system (2.1), we obtain the said derivative as follows:

	
d⁢vd⁢t=[a1⁢x-y⁢p1⁢(x)-z⁢p2⁢(x)]+h⁢[-γ1⁢y+c1⁢y⁢p1⁢(x)]+k⁢[-γ2⁢z+c2⁢z⁢p2⁢(x)]
	




Abstract and Applied Analysis 5 Since (x¯,y¯,z¯) is an equilibrium point for system (2.1), so we can add the zero equations to d⁢v/d⁢t as follows:

	d⁢vd⁢t=	[a1⁢x-y⁢p1⁢(x)-z⁢p2⁢(x)]+h⁢[-γ1⁢y+c1⁢y⁢p1⁢(x)]+k⁢[-γ2⁢z+c2⁢z⁢p2⁢(x)]

and by putting h=1/c1 and k=1/c2, we find out

	
d⁢vd⁢t=a1⁢(x-x¯)-γ1c1⁢(y-y¯)-γ2c2⁢(z-z¯).
	

Therefore, d⁢v/d⁢t<0 if x<x¯,y>y¯ and z>z¯. This completes the proof.","he system (4.1) is stable in equilibrium point (x¯,y¯,z¯). Proof: nsider Lyapunov function v()=c2⁢∫x¯xs-x¯s⁢𝑑s+c3⁢∫y¯yt-y¯t⁢𝑑t+∫z¯zv-z¯v⁢𝑑v Now by differentiate of above Lyapunov function with respect to variable t⁢d⁢vd⁢t is found out as follow:

	
d⁢vd⁢t=c2⁢x-x¯x⁢d⁢xd⁢t+c3⁢y-y¯y⁢d⁢yd⁢t+z-z¯z⁢d⁢zd⁢t
	

Now by instituted d⁢xd⁢t, d⁢yd⁢t and d⁢zd⁢t from system (4.1) d⁢vd⁢t is found out as follow:

As regarding, b1=b2=b and a1=a1=a and b⁢z=a and c2⁢b⁢x+c3

"Here we note that the choice of K and T^ depends only on T, ∥M∥C⁢([0,T];Hσ2), and ∥u0∥1. Next we show that the solution can be extended to the whole interval [0,T]. We first observe the inequality.

"For the example in Fig. 1.3, the occurrence of topological chaos depends on whether the second rod interchange is done in the clockwise or counterclockwise direction. It is the direction of interchange that is important, not the specific shape of the path. If this interchange is counterclockwise, so that the stirrer motion consists of R+followed by L-, then chaos is ”built in” the system in a way that does not depend on the detailed dynamics of the rods or the fluid. The braid representation of this motion is σ1-1⁢σ2. That is, in this case the stirred flow is topologically equivalent (i.e., isotopic) to a chaotic pseudo-Anosov map that has a dense collection of periodic orbits and a Markov partition with irreducible transition matrix M,

	
M=M1-1⁢M2=(2	1
0	1).
	

Except for a finite number of singularities, this pseudo-Anosov map stretches everywhere in the unstable directions by a factor λ=12⁢(3+5)>1, the dominant eigenvalue of M, and contracts everywhere in the stable directions by a factor 1/λ=12⁢(3-5). According to Handel’s isotopy stability theorem [65], this complicated behavior is preserved under isotopy, i.e., under any continuous deformation in which the stirrers remain fixed, so that in a subdomain of the real fluid this stirring motion produces exponential stretching at a rate that is at least λ. (See, e.g., Ref. [17, 144] for a more complete discussion of isotopy in a fluid mechanics context.) The size of the subdomain is not predicted by the ThurstonNielsen theorem, but the experimental results indicate that this region is on the scale of stirrer motions. Thus, if a stirrer motion is of pseudo-Anosov type, a small amount of rough topological data enables prediction of a quantitative lower bound on complexity in the dynamics of the flow. The existing work demonstrates that this prediction is of practical importance in almost all cases considered thus far, the one exception being steady, threedimensional flow in a duct with a ”stirring rod” insert [44]. If the second interchange is instead clockwise, so that the stirrer motion consists of R+

Jie Chen Chapter 1. Introduction 15 followed by L+, the braid in (2+1)-dimensional space-time looks like in Fig. 1.4(b), then the net effect of this motion is simply to twist the fluid around the rods. This motion can be represented as σ1⁢σ2, and the matrix representation is

	
M=M1⁢M2=(1	-1
0	1).
	

Thus, M3=-𝟏, where 1 is the 2×2 unit matrix. Hence, M6 is the identity and this motion is of finite order type. Finite order motions such as this are topologically trivial and the Thurston-Nielsen theorem does not provide any lower bound on complexity in the resulting flow. However, the experimental results show that the corresponding fluid motion can be nontrivial, and even chaotic, but this complexity is due to the dynamics of the flow, not the topology of the boundary motions, and can thus be removed by varying parameters such as the shape of the domain or the speed of the boundaries. Furthermore, qualitative comparison of the experimental results shows the advantage of using a pseudo-Anosov motion to stir the fluid. These two stirring protocols are energetically equivalent, but the stirring produced with the pseudo-Anosov motion is significantly more efficient than that with the finite order motion.","In the example presented in Fig. 1, the appearance of topological chaos depends on the scenario according to which the left and central rods exchange their positions during the second stage of motion, i.e., L+or L-. If this exchange occurs counterclockwise, i.e., the complete period of rod motion consists of R+and L-, then topological chaos arises in the system, and, in this case, the flow of a viscous fluid is topologically equivalent (isotopic) to the chaotic pseudo-Anosov mapping, which is characterized by the dense accumulation of periodic orbits and Markov distribution with a transition matrix A. The pseudo-Anosov mapping is characterized by the exponential stretching of lines in the unstable directions with a coefficient λ>1 (λ is an eigenvalue of the matrix A ) and compression in all stable directions with a coefficient 1/λ.

Suppose that the exchange of rods occurs clockwise, and the complete period of rod motion consists of R+ and L+. Then we have here the regular case of motion, in the course of which the fluid appears to twist about the rods. In Fig. 1e, we show that, in this case, the advection of a viscous fluid can be nontrivial and even chaotic, but one cannot reach this by considering only the topology of motion of the boundaries, and it is necessary, in addition, to change, for example, the domain geometry or the velocity of motion of the boundaries. The qualitative comparison of experimental results in Fig. 1 demonstrates the advantage of using the case of pseudoAnosov motion of the rods for better stirring of the fluid. Two stirring protocols R+⁢L-and R+⁢L+are equivalent from the energy viewpoint, but stirring generated by the protocol of rod motion R+⁢L-, i.e., of the pseudoAnosov type, is more efficient as compared with protocol R+⁢L+.",1274.76184_source.tex,1274.76184.tex,Deletions; Different Presentation
"Three types of stirring motions as shown in Fig. 1.3 are applied here as in the stirring experiments [17]. As shown in Fig. 1.3(a), during the R+motion, the right and the center rods interchange their positions simultaneously along a circular path clockwise, while the left rod remains stationary. During the L+and L-motions, the right rod remains stationary while the left and center rods interchange their positions along a circular path either in the clockwise direction, as shown in Fig. 1.3(b), or in the counter-clockwise direction, as shown in Fig. 1.3(c), respectively.

"Topological entropy also serves as a way of quantifying chaos. In mathematics, the topological entropy of a dynamical system is a nonnegative real number that measures the complexity of the system. Topological entropy was first introduced in 1965 by Adler, Konheim and McAndrew [2]. In particular, the topological entropy is positive for chaotic systems and zero for non-chaotic systems [105]. For a system given by an iterated function, the topological entropy represents the exponential growth rate of the number of distinguishable orbits of the iterates. The Thurston-Nielsen theorem gives a quantitative lower bound on the topological entropy of a flow. This lower bound is referred to as hTN in this thesis. When the flow is of pseudo-Anosov type, the theorem guarantees that hTN>0. Topological entropy is the logarithm of the maximum stretching rate in the flow. Thus, when the flow

The topological entropy of a dynamic system is a nonnegative real number describing the degree of complexity of the system. For chaotic systems, their topological entropy is a positive number, whereas this number for nonchaotic systems is equal to zero. Since the flow of a yiscous fluid belongs to the pseudo-Anosov type, its topological entropy hT⁢N>0 according to the Thurston-Nielsen theorem, and, as shown in [6], hT⁢N=ln⁡[12⁢(3+5)]≈0.96  and λ=12⁢(3+5) ( λ is the value of stretching in the fluid).

Not only are the polynomials given in a simple form but all the Gauss quadrature nodes and the associated weights are also given in closed form.

x=2⁢∫f⁢(θ)⁢cos⁡θ⁢d⁢θ,

(f⁢(θ)≠0).
	

We construct the curve in the following way. Let C be an analytic plane curve

	
x=a⁢(s),y=b⁢(s) (α<s<β).
	

We assume that the radius of curvature is always positive. Let τ be the angle between the tangent of C and the x-a⁢x⁢i⁢s. s can be expressed as an analytic function of τ in (α,β) with d⁢sd⁢T>0. Then the bord line is

	
x=a⁢(s⁢(τ)),y=b⁢(s⁢(τ)),z=s⁢(τ)
	

and we have

	d⁢xd⁢τ	=s′⁢(τ)⁢cos⁡τ,	
	d⁢yd⁢τ	=s′⁢(τ)⁢sin⁡τ,	
	d⁢zd⁢τ	=s′⁢(τ)

{x=12⁢[a⁢(s⁢(θ-σ))+a⁢(s⁢(θ+σ))]
y=12⁢[b⁢(s⁢(θ-σ))+b⁢(s⁢(θ+σ))]
z=12⁢[s⁢(θ-σ)+s⁢(θ+σ)]
	

The extension can reach to σ=π2⁢(ρ→∞) and the corresponding tagential planes are parallel to the z-axis. The surface can be extended further so that σ will be valued in (π2,π). When σ→π, we obtain a curve

	
z=12⁢[s⁢(θ+π)+s⁢(θ-π)]
x=12[a(s(θ+π)+a(s(θ-π))]
y=12⁢[b⁢(s⁢(θ+π))+b⁢(s⁢(θ-π))]

σ=cosh-1⁡Iρ⁢(σ>0),ρ<1⁢. 
	

We can make the extension as big as possible. In particular, if s⁢(θ+i⁢σ) is an integral function such that s′⁢(θ+i⁢σ) does not vanish, the extension is valid for all ρ<1 except for ρ=0. We can construct the extension through the second bord line in a similar way.","We are interested in the construction of whole mixed extremal surfaces. First we assume |q|<|p|, it is convenient to start with a borderline of the space-like part and time-like part. The curve should be an analytic curve of null length

	
t=∫-f⁢(θ)⁢sh⁡θ⁢d⁢θ,x=∫f⁢(θ)⁢ch⁡θ⁢d⁢θ,y=∫f⁢(θ)⁢𝑑θ (f⁢(θ)≠0).
	

We construct the curve in the following way. Let L be an analytic plane curve

	
t=α⁢(s),x=β⁢(s) (a<s<b).
	

We assume that the radius of curvature is always positive. Let τ be the angle between the tangent of L and x-axis. s can be expressed as an analytic function of τ in (a,b) with d⁢sd⁢τ>0. Then the borderline is

	
t=α⁢(s⁢(τ)),x=β⁢(s⁢(τ)),y=s⁢(τ),
	

and we have

	
d⁢td⁢τ=-s′⁢(τ)⁢sh⁡τ,d⁢xd⁢τ=s′⁢(τ)⁢ch⁡τ,d⁢yd⁢τ=s′⁢(τ).
	

Actually, the curve is determined by the function s=s⁢(τ). Then the time-like surface extension from the borderline is

	x	=12⁢[β⁢(s⁢(θ-σ))+β⁢(s⁢(θ+σ))]	
	t	=12⁢[α⁢(s⁢(θ-σ))+α⁢(s⁢(θ+σ))]	
	y	=12⁢[s⁢(θ-σ)+s⁢(θ+σ)]	

with σ=ch-1⁡1ρ,ρ<1. Using similar procedures, we can get the biggest extension. In particular, if s is an integral function such that s′≠0, the extension is valid for all ρ<1 except for ρ=0.

As might be expected from physical consideration, the wave speed reaches its maximum value at the center of stenosis and gets smaller and smaller as one goes away from the center of the stenosis. The variations of radial displacement and the fluid pressure with the distance parameter are also examined numerically. The results seem to be consistent with physical intuition. 2. Basic equations and theoretical preliminaries In this section, we shall give the derivation of the field equations of an elastic tube, which is considered to be a model for an artery, and a Newtonian fluid of variable viscosity, which is assumed to be a model for blood. 2.1. Equations of tube In this sub-section, we shall derive the governing equations of an elastic tube filled with a Newtonian fluid of variable viscosity. Such a combination of a solid and a fluid is considered to be a model for blood flow in arteries.

For a healthy human being, the systolic pressure is about 120⁢m⁢m⁢H⁢g, and the diastolic pressure is around 80⁢m⁢m⁢H⁢g. This means that the arteries are subjected to a mean pressure P0=100⁢m⁢m⁢H⁢g, and in the course of blood flow, a dynamical pressure increment Δ⁢P=±20⁢m⁢m⁢H⁢g is added on this initial field. Moreover, experimental studies [2] revealed that the arteries are also subjected to an initial axial stretch λz, which is about λz=1.6. These observations show that the arteries are initially subjected to static deformation both in the radial and the axial directions, and a dynamical pressure (or a radial displacement u* ) is superimposed on this initial deformation. Due to the external tethering in the axial direction, the effect of axial displacement is neglected.

Now, we consider a thin and long tube of circular cross-section with radius R*⁢(Z*) in the cylindrical polar coordinates (R*,Θ,Z*). Then, the position vector of a point on the tube may be described by

	
𝐑=R*⁢(Z*)⁢𝐞r+Z*⁢𝐞𝐳,
	

where 𝐞𝐫,𝐞θ and 𝐞z are the unit base vectors in the cylindrical polar coordinates and Z* is the axial coordinates of a material point in the natural state. The arclengths along the meridional and circumferential curves are given by

	
d⁢SZ=[1+(d⁢R*d⁢Z*)2]1/2⁢d⁢Z*,d⁢SΘ=R*⁢(Z*)⁢d⁢Θ.
	




1136 T.K. Gaik, H. Demiray / Chaos, Solitons and Fractals 38 (2008) 1134-1145 Motivated with the experimental observations [2], we shall assume that the elastic tube is subjected to an axial stretch ratio λz, and the static pressure P0*⁢(Z*). Then, the deformation may be described by

	
𝐫0=r*⁢(z*)⁢𝐞𝐫+z*⁢𝐞𝐳,z*=λz⁢Z*,
	

where z* is the axial coordinate after static deformation, and r*⁢(z*) characterizes the variable radius after this static deformation. Then the arclengths after static deformation along the meridional and circumferential directions are given by

	
d⁢sz0=[1+(r*)2]1/2⁢d⁢z*,d⁢sθ=r*⁢(z*)⁢d⁢θ,

Upon this initial static deformation, we shall superimpose a finite dynamical radial displacement u*⁢(z*,t*), where t* is the time parameter, but, in view of the external tethering in the axial direction, the axial displacement is assumed to be negligible. Then, the position vector 𝐫 of a generic point on the tube may be described by

	
𝐫=[r*⁢(z*)+u*⁢(z*,t*)]⁢𝐞𝐫+z*⁢𝐞𝐳.
	

The arc lengths along the deformed meridional and circumferential curves are respectively given by

	
d⁢sz=[1+(r*′+∂⁡u*∂⁡z*)2]1/2⁢d⁢z*,d⁢sθ=[r*⁢(z*)+u*⁢(z*,t*)]⁢d⁢θ.
	

Then, the stretch ratios along the meridional and circumferential curves in the final configuration read, respectively, by

	
λ1=λz⁢[1+(r*′+∂^⁢u*∂⁡z*]2]1/2[1+λz2⁢(R*′)2]1/2,λ2=r*⁢(z*)+u*⁢(z*,t*)R*⁢(z*).
	

The unit tangent vector 𝐭 along the deformed meridional curve and the unit exterior normal vector 𝐧 to the deformed membrane are given by

	
𝐭=(r′′+∂⁡u*∂⁡z*)⁢𝐞𝐫+𝐞zΛ,𝐧=𝐞𝐫-(r*′+∂⁡u*∂⁡z*)⁢𝐞zΛ,
	

where the function Λ is defined by

	
[1+(rz′+∂⁡u*∂⁡z*)2]1/2⁢. 
	

The material that we shall consider is assumed to be incompressible. This condition imposes the following restriction on the thickness H, and h, before and after deformation, respectively

	
h=Hλ1⁢λ2.
	

Let T1 and T2 be the membrane forces along the meridional and circumferential curves, respectively. Then, the equation of the radial motion of a small tube element placed between the planes z*= const, z*+d⁢z*= const, θ= const and θ+d⁢θ= const may be given by

where ρ0 is the mass density of the membrane material, and Pr* is the radial fluid reaction forces on the inner surface of the tube.

Let μ⁢Σ be the strain energy density function of the tube material, where μ is the shear modulus. Then, the membrane forces T1 and T2 may be expressed in terms of the stretch ratios as

	
T1=μ⁢Hλ2⁢∂⁡Σ∂⁡λ1,T2=μ⁢Hλ1⁢∂⁡Σ∂⁡λ2.
	




T.K. Gaik, H. Demiray / Chaos, Solitons and Fractals 38 (2008) 1134-1145 1137 Introducing Eq. (12) into Eq. (11), the equation of motion of the tube in the radial direction takes the following form:

Moreover, due to high shear rate near the arterial wall the viscosity of blood is further reduced.

where α is a material constant and I1 is the first invariant of Finger deformation tensor defined by I1=λz2+λθ2+1/(λz2⁢λθ2). Introducing (61) into Eq. (42), the coefficients γ0,γ1,γ2⁢β0,β1 and β2 are obtained as

	
γ0=1λθ⁢λz⁢(λθ-1λθ3⁢λz2)⁢F⁢(λθ,λz),
γ1=1λθ⁢λz⁢[(1+3λθ4⁢λz2)+2⁢α⁢(λθ-1λθ3⁢λz2)2]⁢F⁢(λθ,λz),
γ2=12⁢λθ⁢λz⁢[-12⁢λθ5⁢λz2+6⁢α⁢(λθ-1λθ3⁢λz2)⁢(1+3λθ4⁢λz2)+4⁢α2⁢(λθ-1λθ3⁢λz2)3]⁢F⁢(λθ,λz),
β0=1λθ⁢(λz-1λθ2⁢λz3)⁢F⁢(λθ,λz),β1=γ1-γ0λθ,β2=γ2-β1λθ,
	

where the function F⁢(λθ,λz) is defined by

	
F⁢(λθ,λz)=exp⁡[α⁢(λθ2+λz2+1λθ2⁢λz2-3)].
	

Right now, we need the value of material constant α. For the static case, the present model was compared by Demiray [20] with the experimental measurements by Simon et al. [21] on canine abdominal artery with the characteristics Ri=0.31⁢cm,R0=0.38⁢cm and λz=1.53, and the value of the material constant α was found to be α=1.948. Using this numerical value of the coefficient α, and for the initial deformation λθ=λz=1.6, we obtain γ0=49.183,γ1=326.844,γ2=1176.561,β0=78.692,β1=296.105,β2=991.496,c=15.391,",1152.74336.tex,1213.35364.tex,Variation of subject; None

The above lemma is due to Dewan and Mir [2]. LEMMA 3. Let p⁢(z)=c0+∑v=μncv⁢zv,1⩽μ⩽n, be a polynomial of degree n having no zero in the disk |z|<k,k⩾1. Then

1n⁢|cn-1cn|⩽k.
	

Proof of Lemma 4. If p⁢(z) has all its zeros on |z|=k,k⩽1, then q⁢(z)= (zn⁢p⁢(1z¯)¯) has all its zeros on |z|=1k,1k⩾1. Now applying Lemma 3 for μ=1 to the polynomial q⁢(z), Lemma 4 follows.

GROWTH OF POLYNOMIALS WITH PRESCRIBED ZEROS 359 3. Proof of the Theorems Proof of Theorem 1. Let M⁢(p,1)=max|z|=1⁡|p⁢(z)|. Since p⁢(z) is a polynomial of degree n having all its zeros on |z|=k,k⩽1, therefore, by Lemma 1, we have

	
|p′⁢(z)|⩽nkn-1+kn⁢M⁢(p,1)⁢ for ⁢|z|=1⁢. 
	

Now applying inequality (1.1) to the polynomial p′⁢(z) which is of degree n-1 and noting (3.1), it follows that for all r⩾1 and 0⩽θ<2⁢π

	
|p′⁢(r⁢ei⁢θ)|⩽n⁢rn-1kn-1+kn⁢M⁢(p,1).
	

Also for each θ,0⩽θ<2⁢π and R⩾1, we obtain

	{p⁢(R⁢ei⁢θ)}s-{p⁢(ei⁢θ)}s	=∫1Rdd⁢t⁢{p⁢(t⁢ei⁢θ)}s⁢𝑑t	
		=∫1Rs⁢{p⁢(t⁢ei⁢θ)}s-1⁢p′⁢(t⁢ei⁢θ)⁢ei⁢θ⁢𝑑t	

This implies

	
|{p⁢(R⁢ei⁢θ)}s-{p⁢(ei⁢θ)}s|⩽s⁢∫1R|p⁢(t⁢ei⁢θ)|s-1⁢|p′⁢(t⁢ei⁢θ)|⁢𝑑t
	

which on combining with inequalities (3.2) and (1.1), we get

	|{p⁢(R⁢ei⁢θ)}s-{p⁢(ei⁢θ)}s|	⩽n⁢skn-1+kn⁢{M⁢(p,1)}s⁢∫1Rtn⁢s-1⁢𝑑t	
		=(Rn⁢s-1kn-1+kn)⁢{M⁢(p,1)}s	

Which implies

	|p⁢(R⁢ei⁢θ)|s	⩽|p⁢(ei⁢θ)|s+(Rn⁢s-1kn-1+kn)⁢{M⁢(p,1)}s	
		⩽{M⁢(p,1)}s+(Rn⁢s-1kn-1+kn)⁢{M⁢(p,1)}s	

Hence, from (3.3), we conclude that

	
{M⁢(p,R)}s⩽(kn-1+kn+Rn⁢s-1kn-1+kn)⁢{M⁢(p,1)}s.
	

This completes the proof of Theorem 1.

360 K. K. DEWAN AND A. AHUJA Proof of Theorem 2. The proof of Theorem 2 follows on the same lines as that of Theorem 1 by using Lemma 2 instead of Lemma 1 . But for the sake of completeness we give a brief outline of the proof. Since p⁢(z) is a polynomial of degree n having all its zeros on |z|=k,k⩽1, therefore, by Lemma 2 , we have

Now p′⁢(z) is a polynomial of degree n-1, therefore, it follows by (1.1) that for all r⩾1 and 0⩽θ<2⁢π

GROWTH OF POLYNOMIALS 137 3. PROOF OF THE THEOREMS Proof of Theorem 1. Let (p,1)=max|z|=1⁡|p⁢(z)|. Since p⁢(z) is a polynomial of degree n having all its zeros |z|=k,k≤1, therefore, by Lemma 1 , we have

	
max|z|=1⁡|p′⁢(z)|≤nkn-1+kn⁢M⁢(p,1)  for ⁢|z|=1.
	

Now applying inequality (1.1) to the polynomial p′⁢(z) which is of degree n-1 and noting (3.1), it follows that for all r≥1 and 0≤θ<2⁢π

	
|p′⁢(r⁢ei⁢θ)|≤n⁢rn-1kn-1+kn⁢M⁢(p,1).
	

Also for each θ,0≤θ<2⁢π and R≥1, we obtain

Which on combining with inequality (3.2) and (1.1), we get

Hence from (3.3) we conclude that

	
{M⁢(p,R)}s≤(kn-1+kn+Rn⁢s-rn⁢skn-1+kn)⁢{M⁢(p,1)}s.
	

This completes the proof of Theorem 1. Proof of Theorem 2. The proof of Theorem 2 follows on the same lines as that of Theorem 1 by using Lemma 2 instead of Lemma 1. But for the sake of completeness we give a brief outline of the proof. Since p⁢(z) is a polynomial of degree n having all its zeros on |z|=k,k≤1, therefore, by Lemma 2 , we have

	
|p′(z)|≤nkn[n⁢|cn|⁢k2+|cn-1|n⁢|cn|⁢(1+k2)+2⁢|cn-1|M(p,1)  for |z|=1.

W e introduce and investigate a framework for constructing algorithms to invert Laplace transforms numerically.

We examine three one-dimensional inversion routines in this framework: the Gaver-Stehfest algorithm, a version of the Fourier-series method with Euler summation, and a version of the Talbot algorithm, which is based on deforming the contour in the Bromwich inversion integral.

"One way to see the role of t-1 is to consider appropriate Abelian and Tauberian theorems, in particular, the familiar initial-value and final-value theorems; e.g., see Bingham et al. (1987), Doetsch (1974), or Feller (1971). In simple form, the initial-value theorem states that, when the two limits both exist,

	
limt↓0⁡f⁢(t)=limt↓0⁡1t⁢f^⁢(1t),

Moreover, other refined asymptotics agree when the transform is scaled in that way, e.g., see Heavyside’s theorem, Theorem 37.1 of Doetsch (1974).

8 Starting from the Bromwich Inversion Integral

We now start to review Wellekens’ (1970) argument, which begins with the Bromwich inversion integral. Since the Euler and Talbot algorithms also can be derived from the Bromwich inversion integral, this argument explains why they too fit in the framework (2).

Suppose that f is a real-valued function of a nonnegative real variable, which is continuous at t. The Bromwich inversion integral expresses f⁢(t) as the contour integral

	
f⁢(t)=12⁢π⁢i⁢∫Cf^⁢(s)⁢es⁢t⁢𝑑s,t>0,
	

where the contour C extends from c-i⁢∞ to c+i⁢∞ for c>0, falling to the right of all singularities of f^, under the usual regularity conditions; see Theorem 24.4 of Doetsch (1974).

Following Wellekens (1970), we make the change of variables z= st and rewrite the contour integral as

	
f⁢(t)=12⁢π⁢i⁢t⁢∫C′f^⁢(z/t)⁢ez⁢𝑑z,t>0,
	

where C′ is the same contour as a function of z. By that step alone, we see how t-1 appears both in the multiplicative constant and the argument of the transform f^. Indeed, almost any method of numerical integration (approximate quadrature) applied to the integral in (9) produces the representation (2); see Davis and Rabinowitz (1984).","ne way to see the role of t-1 is to consider appropriate Abelian and Tauberian theorems, in particular, the familiar initial-value and final-value theorems; e.g., see Bingham et al.

"To achieve the unified framework in (2) from (9), Wellekens (1970) approximated the exponential function ez in the integrand of (9) by a rational function. Indeed, both of the earlier approaches exploit rational approximations for the exponential function, so we digress to discuss that intermediate step now.

Writing the rational function in a partial-fraction representation (e.g., see p. 76 of Doetsch 1974), we have

	
ez≈∑k=0nωkαk-z,
	

where z is a complex variable and αk and ωk are complex numbers.

We will impose regularity conditions on the complex numbers αk and ωk appearing in (10): First, we will assume that the parameters αk are distinct, implying that the rational approximant in (10) has n+1 poles. We will require that the approximant be analytic for Re⁡(z)>0. Consequently, we assume that Re⁡(αk)<0 for all k. We also assume that the pairs of complex numbers (αk,ωk) occur in complex-conjugate pairs. (If s≡u+i⁢v, then its complex conjugate is s¯≡ u-i⁢v.) That is, if either αk or ωk has a non-zero imaginary part, then we also have the pair (α¯k,ω¯k) among the n terms in the sum (10). Since

	
ωkαk-z+ω¯kα¯k-z
	

is real for all real z, that condition guarantees that the approximating rational function is real-valued for all real z. Consequently, we can alternatively express (10) as

	
ez≈12⁢∑k=0n[ωkαk-z+ω¯kα¯k-z],
	

where Re⁡(αk)<0 for all k.

Of course, we want to choose the rational function in (10) or (11) so that we obtain a good approximation. A classic way to do that is to choose the complex numbers αk and ωk so as to match the MacLaurin series of the two functions as far as possible. That procedure is effective; indeed, that procedure is the classical method of Padé approximation; moreover, the exponential function was one of the first functions to be treated; see the Preface and Section 1.2 of Baker and Graves-Morris (1996). It should thus not be surprising that Zakian (1969, 1970, 1973) and Wellekens (1970) exploited Padé approximation when they approximated the exponential function, but of course there are many other possible rational approximations for the exponential function, with merits depending on the context.","To achieve the unified framework in (2) from (9), Wellekens (1970) approximated the exponential function ez in the integrand of (9) by a rational function.

We note that the prolonged covariant differentiation preserves the weights of the satellites.

A Kaehlerian Weyl space denoted by K⁢Wn is an n-dimensional (n=2⁢m) space with an almost complex structure Fij satisfying

		Fij⁢Fjk=-δik	
		gi⁢j⁢Fhi⁢Fkj=gh⁢k	
		∇˙k⁢Fij=0,( for all ⁢i,j,k)	
		Fi⁢j=gj⁢k⁢Fik=-Fj⁢i,	
	
Fi⁢j=gi⁢h⁢Fhj=-Fj⁢i.
	

The tensors Fi⁢j and Fi⁢j are of weight 2 and -2, respectively [9] .

The mixed curvature tensor Rj⁢k⁢li and the covariant curvature tensor Ri⁢j⁢k⁢l of Wn⁢(g,T) are given respectively,

	
Rj⁢k⁢li=∂∂⁡xlΓi-j⁢ki∂∂⁡xkΓj⁢li+Γh⁢liΓj⁢kh-Γh⁢kiΓj⁢lh
	

and Ri⁢j⁢k⁢l=gi⁢h⁢Rj⁢k⁢lh where Γj⁢ki ’s are defined in (6) .

The Ricci tensor and the scalar curvature of Wn⁢(g,T) are defined by

	
Ri⁢j⁢aa=Ri⁢j, and  R=gi⁢j⁢Ri⁢j.
	

Also, it can be seen that the anti-symmetric part of the Ricci tensor satisfies [6]

	
R[i⁢j]=n⁢∇[i⁡Tj].
	

Pure and hybrid tensors in Kaehlerian Weyl spaces are defined similar to the definitions in Riemannian spaces. Let T be a tensor field of type (0,2) on K⁢Wn. If T satisfies T⁢(J⁢X,J⁢Y)=T⁢(X,Y) for any vector fields X, Y and any almost complex structure J on K⁢Wn (in local coordinates Ts⁢r⁢Jjs⁢Jir=Tj⁢i ) then T is said to be a hybrid tensor with respect to j and i and if T⁢(J⁢X,J⁢Y)=-T⁢(X,Y) (in local coordinates Ts⁢r⁢Jjs⁢Jir=-Tj⁢i ), then T is said to be a pure tensor with respect to j and i in a Kaehlerian Weyl space [10].

Let

	
Hi⁢j=12⁢Ri⁢j⁢k⁢l⁢Fk⁢l,Mi⁢j=gk⁢i⁢Rjk,
	

where, Ri⁢j⁢k⁢l=gi⁢h⁢Rj⁢k⁢lh,Rjk=Rj⁢k⁢lh⁢gk⁢l. Then the following relations hold [10] :
a) Mi⁢j=(n-2n)⁢Ri⁢j+2n⁢Rj⁢i=Ri⁢j+2⁢n⁢(Rj⁢i-Ri⁢j)
b) Hi⁢j=-Mh⁢j⁢Fih=Mi⁢h⁢Fjh, c) Hh⁢i⁢Fjh=-Hj⁢h⁢Fih=Mj⁢i,

d) Hh⁢i⁢Fh⁢i=-Mh⁢i⁢gh⁢i=-R

e) Ri⁢j⁢k⁢l+Rj⁢i⁢k⁢l=4⁢∇[k⁡Tl]⁢gi⁢j.

f) Hi⁢j+Hj⁢i=0.

2 Generalized conformally Kaehlerian Weyl spaces

An n-dimensional Weyl space is called a generalized recurrent Weyl space if its curavture tensor Rl⁢i⁢j⁢k satisfies the condition

	
∇˙r⁢Rl⁢i⁢j⁢k=Ar⁢Rl⁢i⁢j⁢k+Br⁢(gl⁢j⁢gi⁢k-gl⁢k⁢gi⁢j),
	

where A and B are non-zero two 1-forms of weights 0 and -2, respectively, [11]. By putting Gl⁢i⁢j⁢k=gl⁢j⁢gi⁢k-gl⁢k⁢gi⁢j,(23) becomes

	
∇˙r⁢Rl⁢i⁢j⁢k=Ar⁢Rl⁢i⁢j⁢k+Br⁢Gl⁢i⁢j⁢k.
	

If the 1-form B is zero, then the Weyl space reduces to recurrent Weyl space [8].

Now, we introduce the following definitions on recurrent Kaehlerian Weyl spaces.

Definition 2.1. An n-dimensional (n=2⁢m)

Kaehlerian Weyl space is said to be a generalized recurrent if its curvature tensor Rlijk  of weight 2 satisfies the condition

Now we study the boundary behavior of ΠΩa⁢[g]⁢(P). Let Q′=(t′,Φ′)∈∂⁡Cn⁢(Ω) be any fixed point and L be any positive number such that L>max⁡{t′+1,45⁢R}. Let χS⁢(L) be the characteristic function of S(L)={Q=(t,Φ)∈∂Cn(Ω),t≤L} and write

Since limΘ→Φ′⁡φ⁢(Θ)=0,ΠΩ,2a⁢[g]⁢(P)=O⁢(rιk+⁢φ⁢(Θ)) and therefore tends to zero. So the function ΠΩa⁢[g]⁢(P) can be continuously extended to Cn⁢(Ω)¯ such that

Thus, by Krylov transitivity, there is an endomorphism of G mapping x to x+z and so, of course, there is a mapping ψ:x↦z. Moreover, UG⁢(z)=UG⁢(y) and so there is an endomorphism θ with z⁢θ=y.

H⁢(x+z)=H⁢(x+y-(y-z))=α0.
	

Since H⁢(x+y)>α0,H⁢(y-z)=α0. Therefore,

	
U⁢(x+z)=(α0,α1,α2,…)=U⁢(x).
	

Now by strong transitivity there is an endomorphism f′ of M such that f′⁢(x)=x+z and there is an endomorphism f which maps x onto z.

668 J. Li, J. Luo and Z. Wang We first prove that {xn} is bounded in H by contradiction. Assume that {xn} is unbounded. Let {zk} be an arbitrary sequence bounded in H. It follows from (3.2) that, for any k∈ℕ,

Thus

"1. INTRODUCTION Let 𝒜 denote the family of functions f which are analytic in the open unit disk 𝒰={z : |z|<1} and are normalized by

For 0≤α<1, let ℬ⁢(α) denote the class of functions f of the form (1.1) so that ℜ⁡(f′)>α in 𝒰. The functions in ℬ⁢(α) are called functions of bounded turning (c.f. [3, Vol. II]). By the Nashiro-Warschowski Theorem (see e.g. [3, Vol. I]) the functions in ℬ⁢(α) are univalent and also close-to-convex in 𝒰. For f of the form (1.1), the Libera integral operator F is given by

2 JAY M. JAHANGIRI AND K. FARAHMAND The n-th partial sums Fn⁢(z) of the Libera integral operator F⁢(z) are given by

	
Fn⁢(z)=z+∑k=2n2k+1⁢ak⁢zk.
	

In [5] it was shown that if f∈𝒜 is starlike of order α,α=0.294⁢…, then so is the Libera integral operator F. We also know that (see e.g. [1]), there are functions which are univalent or spiral-like in 𝒰 so that their Libera integral operators are not univalent or spiral-like in 𝒰. Li and Owa [4] proved that if f∈𝒜 is univalent in 𝒰, then Fn⁢(z) is starlike in |z|<38. The number 38 is sharp. In this paper we make use of a result of Gasper [2] to provide a simple proof for the following theorem. Theorem 1.1 (Main Theorem). If 14≤α<1 and f∈ℬ⁢(α), then Fn∈ℬ⁢(4⁢α-13). 2. Preliminary LeMMAS To prove our Main Theorem, we shall need the following three lemmas. The first lemma is due to Gasper ([2, Theorem 1]) and the third lemma is a well-known and celebrated result (c.f. [3, Vol. I]) which can be derived from Herglotz’s representation for positive real part functions. Lemma 2.1. Let θ be a real number and m and k be natural numbers. Then

	
13+∑k=1mcos⁡(k⁢θ)k+2≥0
	

Lemma 2.2. For z∈𝒰 we have

	
ℜ⁡(∑k=1mzkk+2)>-13.
	

Proof. For 0≤r<1 and for 0≤|θ|≤π write z=r⁢ei⁢θ=r⁢(cos⁡(θ)+i⁢sin⁡(θ)). By DeMoivre’s law and the minimum principle for harmonic functions, we have

	
ℜ⁡(∑k=1mzkk+2)=∑k=1mrk⁢cos⁡(k⁢θ)k+2>∑k=1mcos⁡(k⁢θ)k+2.
	

Now by Abel’s lemma (c.f. Titchmarsh [6]) and condition (2.1) of Lemma 2.1 we conclude that the right hand side of (2.2) is greater than or equal to -13.

Lemma 2.3. Let P⁢(z) be analytic in 𝒰,P⁢(0)=1, and ℜ⁡(P⁢(z))>12 in 𝒰. For functions Q analytic in 𝒰 the convolution function P*Q takes values in the convex hull of the image on 𝒰 under Q.

The operator ” * ” stands for the Hadamard product or convolution of two power series f⁢(z)= ∑k=1∞ak⁢zk and g⁢(z)=∑k=1∞bk⁢zk denoted by (f*g)⁢(z)=∑k=1∞ak⁢bk⁢zk. 3. PROOF OF THE MAIN THEOREM Let f be of the form (1.1) and belong to ℬ⁢(α) for 14≤α<1. Since ℜ⁡(f′⁢(z))>α we have

	
ℜ⁡(1+12⁢(1-α)⁢∑k=2∞k⁢ak⁢zk-1)>12.

PARTIAL SUMS OF FUNCTIONS OF BOUNDED TURNING 3 Applying the convolution properties of power series to Fn′⁢(z) we may write (3.2) Fn′⁢(z)=1+∑k=2n2⁢kk+1⁢ak⁢zk-1

	
=(1+12⁢(1-α)⁢∑k=2∞k⁢ak⁢zk-1)*(1+(1-α)⁢∑k=2n4k+1⁢zk-1)
=P⁢(z)*Q⁢(z)
	

From Lemma 2.2 for m=n-1 we obtain

	
ℜ⁡(∑k=2nzk-1k+1)>-13.
	

Applying a simple algebra to the above inequality (3.3) and Q⁢(z) in (3.2) yields

	
ℜ⁡(Q⁢(z))=ℜ⁡(1+(1-α)⁢∑k=2n4k+1⁢zk-1)>4⁢α-13.
	

On the other hand, the power series P⁢(z) in (3.2) in conjunction with the condition (3.1) yields ℜ⁡(P⁢(z))>12. Therefore, by Lemma 2.3,ℜ⁡(Fn′⁢(z))>4⁢α-13. This concludes the Main Theorem. Remark 3.1. The Main Theorem also holds for α<14. We also note that ℬ⁢(α) for α<0 is no longer a bounded turning family.","1. Introduction. Let 𝒜 denote the family of functions f which are analytic in the open unit disk 𝒰={z:|z|<1} and are normalized by

	
f⁢(z)=z+∑k=2∞ak⁢zk,z∈𝒰.
	

For 0≤α<1, let ℬ⁢(α) denote the class of functions f of the form (1.1) so that ℜ⁢(f′)>α in 𝓁. The functions in ℬ⁢(α) are called functions of bounded turning (cf. [4]). By the Nashiro-Warschowski theorem (see, e.g., [3]), the functions in ℬ⁢(α) are univalent and also close-to-convex in u. For f of the form (1.1), the Libera integral operator F is given by

	
F⁢(z)=2z⁢∫0zf⁢(ζ)⁢𝑑ζ=z+∑k=2∞2k+1⁢ak⁢zk.
	

The nth partial sums Fn⁢(z) of the Libera integral operator F⁢(z) are given by

	
Fn⁢(z)=z+∑k=2n2k+1⁢ak⁢zk.
	

In [6] it was shown that if f∈𝒜 is starlike of order α,α=0.294,…, so is the Libera integral operator F. We also know that (see, e.g., [1]) there are functions which are univalent or spiral-like in U so that their Libera integral operators are not univalent or spiral-like in U. Li and Owa [5] proved that if f∈𝒜 is univalent in U, then Fn⁢(z) is starlike in |z|<3/8. The number 3/8 is sharp. In this note we make use of a result of Gasper [2] to provide a simple proof for the following theorem. MAIN THEOREM. If 1/4≤α<1 and f∈ℬ⁢(α), then Fn∈ℬ⁢((4⁢α-1)/3). 2. Preliminary lemmas. To prove our Main theorem, we will need the following three lemmas. The first lemma is due to Gasper (see [2, Theorem 1]) and the third lemma

46 J. M. JAHANGIRI AND K. FARAHMAND is a well-known and celebrated result (cf. [3]) that can be derived from the Herglotz’ representation for positive real part functions. LEMMA 2.1. Let θ be a real number and let m and k be natural numbers. Then

	
13+∑k=1mcos⁡(k⁢θ)k+2≥0.
	

LEMMA 2.2. For z∈𝒰,

	
ℜ⁢(∑k=1mzkk+2)>-13.
	

Proof. For 0≤r<1 and for 0≤|θ|≤π, write z=r⁢ei⁢θ=r⁢(cos⁡(θ)+i⁢sin⁡(θ)). By DeMoivre’s law and the minimum principle for harmonic functions, we have

	
ℜ⁢(∑k=1mzkk+2)=∑k=1mrk⁢cos⁡(k⁢θ)k+2>∑k=1mcos⁡(k⁢θ)k+2.
	

Now by Abel’s lemma (cf. Titchmarsh [7]) and condition (2.1) of Lemma 2.1 we conclude that the right-hand side of (2.3) is greater than or equal to -1/3.

LEmma 2.3. Let P⁢(z) be analytic in U,P⁢(0)=1 and let 𝔨⁢(P⁢(z))>1/2 in u. For functions Q analytic in U, the convolution function P*Q takes values in the convex hull of the image on U under Q.

The operator ”*” stands for the Hadamard product or convolution of two power series f⁢(z)=∑k=1∞ak⁢zk and g⁢(z)=∑k=1∞bk⁢zk denoted by (f*g)⁢(z)=∑k=1∞ak⁢bk⁢zk. 3. Proof of Main theorem. Let f be of the form (1.1) and belong to ℬ⁢(α) for 1/4≤ α<1. Since ℜ⁢(f′⁢(z))>α, we have

	
ℜ⁢(1+12⁢(1-α)⁢∑k=2∞k⁢ak⁢zk-1)>12.
	

Applying the convolution properties of power series to Fn′⁢(z), we may write

	Fn′⁢(z)	=1+∑k=2n2⁢kk+1⁢ak⁢zk-1	
		=(1+12⁢(1-α)⁢∑k=2∞k⁢ak⁢zk-1)*(1+(1-α)⁢∑k=2n4k+1⁢zk-1)	
		=P⁢(z)*Q⁢(z).	

From Lemma 2.2 for m=n-1, we obtain

	
ℜ⁢(∑k=2nzk-1k+1)>-13.
	




PARTIAL SUMS OF FUNCTIONS OF BOUNDED TURNING 47 Applying a simple algebra to inequality (3.3) and Q⁢(z) in (3.2) yields

	
ℜ⁢(Q⁢(z))=ℜ⁢(1+(1-α)⁢∑k=2n4k+1⁢zk-1)>4⁢α-13.
	

On the other hand, the power series P⁢(z) in (3.2) in conjunction with the condition (3.1) yield ℜ⁢(P⁢(z))>1/2. Therefore, by Lemma 2.3,ℜ⁢(Fn′⁢(z))>(4⁢α-1)/3. This concludes the Main theorem.

REMARK 3.1. The Main theorem also holds for α<1/4. We also note that ℬ⁢(α) for α<0 is no longer a bounded turning family.",1126.30304.tex,1291.30077.tex,Paraphrase; Different Presentation

"3 Introduction

A number of problems arising in science and engineering are set in semi-infinite domains. We can apply different spectral methods that are used to solve problems in semi-infinite domains. The first approach is using Laguerre polynomials [1-4].

The second approach is replacing semi-infinite domain with [0,L] interval by choosing L, sufficiently large. This method is named domain truncation [5].

The third approach is reformulating original problem in semiinfinite domain to singular problem in bounded domain by variable transformation and then using the Jacobi polynomials to approximate the resulting singular problem [6].

The fourth approach of spectral method is based on rational orthogonal functions. Boyd [7] defined a new spectral basis, named rational Chebyshev functions on the semi-infinite interval, by mapping to the Chebyshev polynomials. Guo et al. [8] introduced a new set of rational Legendre functions which are mutually orthogonal in L2⁢(0,+∞). They applied a spectral scheme using the rational Legendre functions for solving the Korteweg-de Vries equation on the half line. Boyd et al. [9] applied pseudospectral methods on a semi-infinite interval and compared rational Chebyshev, Laguerre and mapped Fourier sine.

Many science and engineering problems of current interest are set in unbounded domains. We can apply different spectral methods that are used to solve problems in semiinfinite domains. The first approach is using the Laguerre polynomials [1-4]. The second approach is replacing semiinfinite domain with [0,L] interval by choosing L, sufficiently large. This method is named domain truncation [5]. The third approach is reformulating original problem in semi-infinite domain to singular problem in bounded domain by variable transformation and then using the Jacobi polynomials to approximate the resulting singular problem [6]. The fourth approach of spectral method is based on rational orthogonal functions. Boyd [7] defined a new spectral basis, named the rational Chebyshev functions on the semi-infinite interval, by mapping to the Chebyshev polynomials. Guo et al. [8] introduced a new set of the rational Legendre functions which are mutually orthogonal in L2⁢(0,+∞). They applied a spectral scheme using the rational Legendre functions for solving the Korteweg-de Vries equation on the half line. Boyd et al. [9] applied pseudospectral methods on a semi-infinite interval and compared the rational Chebyshev, Laguerre, and mapped Fourier-sine methods.

"One of the most important nonlinear singular ordinary differential equations that occurs in a semi-infinite interval is the Thomas-Fermi equation, as follows [23,24]:

which appears in the problem of determining the effective nuclear charge in heavy atoms. Boundary conditions for this equation are as follows:

	
y⁢(0)=1,limx→∞⁡y⁢(x)=0.
	

The Thomas-Fermi equation is useful for calculating form factors and for obtaining effective potentials which can be used as initial trial potentials in self-consistent field calculations. For an understanding of the early developments of the Thomas-Fermi equation, we refer the reader to see the review [25], which especially pointed out the considerable contributions to this field made by Fermi and Majorana.

The Thomas-Fermi problem has been solved by different techniques. The authors of [26-28] used a perturbative approach to determine analytic solutions for the Thomas-Fermi equation. Bender et al. [26] replaced the right-hand side of this equation by one which contains the parameter δ, i.e., y′′⁢(x)=y⁢(x)⁢(y⁢(x)x)δ; the potential is then expanded in a power series in δ

	
y=y0+δ⁢y1+δ2⁢y2+δ3⁢y3+⋯.
	

This procedure reduced Eq. (1) into a set of linear equations with associated boundary conditions. Laurenzi [27] applied a perturbative method by combining it with an alternate choice of the nonlinear term of Eq. (1) to produce a rapidly converging analytic solution. Cedillo [28] wrote Eq. (1) in terms of density and then the δ-expansion was employed to obtain an absolute converging series of equations. Adomian [29] applied the decomposition method for solving the Thomas-Fermi equation and then Wazwaz [30] proposed a non-perturbative approximate solution to this equation by using the modified decomposition method in a direct manner without any need to a perturbative expansion or restrictive assumptions. He combined the series obtained with the Padé approximation which provided a promising tool to handle problems on an unbounded domain.","One of the most important nonlinear singular ordinary differential equations that occurs in semi-infinite interval is the Thomas-Fermi equation, which is given as follows [15,16] :

T","1 Introduction Electrorheological fluids are special viscous liquids, that are characterized by their ability to undergo significant changes in their mechanical properties when an electric field is applied. This property can be exploited in technological applications, e.g., actuators, clutches, shock absorbers, and rehabilitation equipment to name a few [1].

A model was developed for these liquids within the framework of rational mechanics [2, 3]; it takes into account the complex interactions between the electro-magnetic fields and the moving liquid. If the fluid is assumed to be incompressible, it turns out that the relevant equations of the model are the system

S. Chen, Z. Tan / Journal of Functional Analysis 266 (2014) 4908-4937 4927 Next we use the minimizing property of lz0,θ⁢ρ and D⁢lz0,θ⁢ρ and recall the definition of γ. Thereby we find

for C8=12⁢Cp⁢a⁢(C1+C4)⁢C62 and C9=C2+C3′+C4/2. Adding (4.23),(4.24) and (4.22) together, we can obtain

m*={m⁢(n+2)n-m+2	 if ⁢n+2>m,

"Figure 4 presents a typical case where reinforcement learning procedure is applied. The costs of the best found solution and the current solution of an agent are plotted at the top of Fig. 4. After the application of a diversification operator (o3) and of several intensification operators (o1,o2), the agent improves the cost of its best found solution. Then, a reinforcement is applied on the experiences ⟨c4;o3;10⟩, ⟨c1;o1;-8⟩ and ⟨c2;o2;-4⟩. Thus, the weights w4,3,w1,1 and w2,2 are augmented to favor the selection of the operators in the same conditions. Figure 4⁢b represents the initial weight matrix (α=1) and the matrix obtained after a reinforcement with σ=1. The reinforcement procedure clearly affects the next selections of operators. For instance, if condition c1 is activated after the reinforcement, then the operator o1 has a probability of 66% to be selected against 50% before the reinforcement.

In order to refine the reinforcement learning process, two cases are distinguished, (i) when the agent improves its best found solution, and (ii) when the agent improves the best coalition solution in addition to the best found solution. The learning factors σ1 and σ2 are respectively used for these two cases. The reinforcement is performed using the formula (2).

Suppose the current condition is c4 : No improvement within more than one hundred generations. In this condition, operator o1 is applied for the current generation and obtained an improvement; operator o1 improves the local best solution from 3200 to 3100. Then, reinforcement is applied based on the experience (c4,o1,100). Thus, the weights w4,1 is augmented to favor the selection of the operator pair in this conditions. In Fig. 6 the original weight matrix is shown on the left, and the matrix on the right obtained a reinforcement with σ=1. The reinforcement procedure clearly affects the next selections of the operator pairs. For instance, if condition c4 is activated after the reinforcement, then the operator o1 has a probability of 38 percents to be selected against 28 percents before the reinforcement.

In order to refine the reinforcement learning process, two cases are distinguished, (1) When the agent improves its local best solution, and (2) when the agent improves the global best solution in addition to the local best solution. The learning factors σ1 and σ2 are respectively used for these two cases.

"Our enriched method consists in adding some nodes with special weight functions at each tip. Using Equations (2)-(4) of the MLSA, each node and its associated weight function give a shape function that enrich the set of regular shape functions. Our aim is that these shape functions behave in a way similar to the near tip displacement field given in Equations (9)-(11). To that end, we choose the weight functions to behave in a way similar to Equations (10) and (11) and we expect that the resulting shape functions resemble them-as it is the case for the regular nodes in Figure 1.

More precisely, the following criteria guide us in the choice of the special weight functions: 1. The weight functions should vary as r for small r : this is the main criterion in order to obtain by derivation a stress field that varies as 1/r for small r. 2. They should be positive: this is requested for the positive definiteness of the 𝐀 matrix, given by Equation (4). 3. They should have an angular variation of the same kind as those in Equations (10) and (11): this suggests using cos⁡(θ/2) and sin⁡(θ/2). 4. They should be zero outside a circular support like the regular weights: this provides the enrichment with a local character.

According to some experiments, the use in conjunction of the three following weights appears to be a good choice:

	
wc⁢(𝐱)=α⁢r⁢cos⁡(θ2)⁢S4⁢(s)
wp⁢(𝐱)=α⁢r⁢[1+sin⁡(θ2)]⁢S4⁢(s)
wm⁢(𝐱)=α⁢r⁢[1-sin⁡(θ2)]⁢S4⁢(s)
	

In these equations: - The indices c,p and m, respectively, stand for ’cos’, ’plus sin’ and ’minus sin’. - S4 is the quartic spline function of Equation (6) and the normalized distance s is again given by Equation (7), with the co-ordinates of the three nodes being identical: 𝐱c= 𝐱p=𝐱m=𝐱tip  - We also choose an identical radius of the influence domain, which normalizes the distance in Equation (7): Rc=Rp=Rm. We choose that this radius is equal to the minimum of the radius of the neighbouring regular nodes and the distance between the tip and the first crack tip. So, the domain of influence does not contain any kink. - The α factor controls the amplitude of the enriched weight compared with the amplitude of the regular nodes; α=1 is a reasonable choice.","We propose to intrinsically enrich the kernel function w in order to describe the near crack-tip displacement field. Enriching the kernel function does not require blending domains nor does it increase computational cost as compared to the other methods mentioned above. Our enrichment consists in adding some nodes with special weight functions at each tip. The goal is to create weight functions that lead to shape functions that behave in a way similar to the near tip displacement field. Therefore, we choose the weight functions to behave in a way similar to (9) and the resulting shape functions will resemble them. The requirements imposed on the weighting function are: 1.

"Web Services are the most famous implementation of service-oriented architectures that has brought some challenging research issues. One of these is the composition, i.e., the capability to recursively construct a composite Web service as a workflow of other existing Web services, which are developed by different organizations and offer diverse functionalities (e.g., ticket purchase, payment), transactional properties (e.g., compensatable or not), and Quality of Service (QoS) values (e.g., execution price, success rate). The selection of a Web service, for each activity of the workflow, meeting the user’s requirements, is still an important challenge. Indeed, the selection of one Web service among a set of them that fulfill some functionalities is a critical task, generally depending on a combined evaluation of QoS. However, the conventional QoS-aware composition approaches do not consider the transactional constraints during the composition process. This paper addresses the issue of selecting and composing Web services not only according to their functional requirements but also to their transactional properties and QoS characteristics.

In this paper, we focus on design-time WS selection, and particularly, on automatic selection, where the user is relieved as much as possible from the composition process. We do not focus on the execution step or on the recovery or replanning problems.

While many works have been done for Web service selection, designing a composite Web service to ensure not only correct and reliable execution but also optimal QoS remains an important challenge [2]. Indeed, WSs composition based on transactional properties ensures a reliable execution, however, an optimal QoS composite Web service is not guaranteed. Moreover, composing optimal QoS Web services does not guarantee a reliable execution of the resulting composite Web service. Thus, QoS-aware and transactional-aware should be integrated. However, the problem is generally addressed from the QoS side or from the transactional side separately. The conventional QoSaware composition approaches [3], [4], [5], [6], [7] do not consider the transactional constraints during the composition process, likewise transactional-aware ones [8], [9], [10], [11], [12] do not consider QoS. As far as we know, only Liu et al. [2] propose a composition model in design time, which captures both aspects in order to evaluate the QoS of a composite WS with various transactional requirements. However, the authors do not consider the automatic selection step and only analyze the impact of the transactional requirements on the QoS of the composite WS.

Our research objective is to propose a design-time selection algorithm for automatic WS composition, where transactional and QoS requirements are both integrated in the selection process. It is evident that such an integration could only be done by considering first the transactional

requirements. In fact, as we mentioned above, a local or global optimized QoS composition may not guarantee transactional execution. If the selection is done in two separate steps (transactional selection followed by a QoS one), it is necessary to consider all the transactional combinations satisfying the global transactional requirements, which is a combinatorial problem. For all these reasons, we embedded the QoS-aware service selection with the transactional-aware service selection, using local QoS optimization in order to reduce the set of possible transactional solutions.

Our contribution is a Web service selection algorithm, which guarantees that each selected component WS of a composite one is locally the best QoS WS among all the WS fulfilling the global transaction requirement. Moreover, our algorithm is scalable because the user has only to define a global transaction requirement and does not have to define the possible termination states of all component WS, as done, for example, in [8], [11], [13], because the complexity of such a process increases with the number of component WS.","Service consumer submits business objective which the composition service should achieve, along with some constraints and preferences [1]. Based on those, YAWL [2] is used to be chosen to represent the workflows model and describe the logic of composition Web service. When each activity of a workflow is implemented by a component Web service,

2 Mathematical Problems in Engineering we obtain a composition Web service. Component Web service of every activity fulfilling the user’s goal is selected among a set of candidate services. In this paper we focus on this selection which could be dynamic and automatic, and we do not focus on the execution step, the recovery, or replanning problems.

Although the problem of web service selection and composition has received a lot of attention by many researchers in recent years, designing a composite Web service to ensure not only correct and reliable execution but also optimal QoS remains an important challenge [3]. Indeed, these two aspects of selection are always implemented separately. In [4], a solution combines the business process adequacy of workflow systems and the reliability of transactional processing. Similarly, in [5-9], only transactional properties are considered, and QoS-based selection is not involved. For these researches Web services composition based on transactional properties ensures a reliable execution; however, an optimal QoS composite Web service is not guaranteed. The approaches [10-14] implement conventional optimal QoS composition, but composing optimal QoS Web services does not guarantee a reliable execution of the resulting composite Web service. Therefore, transactional-based and QoSbased should be integrated.

Our research objective is to propose a reliable and efficient selection approach for automatic Web service composition, where transactional and QoS requirements are both integrated in the selection process. Transactional requirements should be considered firstly, because if the selection is done based on QoS firstly (transactional selection followed by a QoS), a local or global optimized QoS composition may not guarantee transactional execution. In other words, the overall consistency and successful termination of composition Web service are not ensured. For those reasons, the selection is done in two separate steps: transactional service selection starts firstly, and the QoS-aware service selection is embedded with the transaction-aware service selection.

The innovation of the paper mainly lies in a few aspects. Firstly, we present an ensuring transactional reliability and QoS service selection approach. The selection of the component Web services is done by matching the Web services properties with the user’s desires. More precisely, the selection is realized depending on transactional and QoS user requirements. The former is established by means of a risk tolerance notion that is given in the paper. And it indicates if the results can be compensated or not. The latter is expressed as a weight over each QoS criterion. Secondly, we build automaton model to implement transactional-aware service selection, and using the model composite Web service can guarantee transactional execution. Moreover, our method is scalable because the user has only to define a global transaction requirement and does not have to define the possible termination states of all component Web service.",1264.68021_source_1.tex,1264.68021.tex,Deletions; Insertions; Paraphrase
"The behavioral description of a WS is regarding how the functionality of a WS can be achieved in terms of interaction with the other WS. In a composition where several component WSs interact, unexpected behavior from a component WS might not only lead to its failure but also may bring negative impact on all the participants of the composition. Therefore, as for all cross-organizational collaborative systems, the execution of a CWS requires Transactional Properties (TPs) so that the overall consistency is ensured. We consider three behavioral properties of WS, pivot (p), compensatable (c), and retriable (r). Inspired by Mehrotra et al. [15], we have the following definitions:

Definition 1 (Pivot WS). A WS is said to be pivot (p) if once it successfully completes, its effects remain forever and cannot be semantically undone. If it fails, it has no effect at all. A completed pivot WS cannot be rolled back.

Definition 2 (Compensatable WS). A WS s is compensatable (c) if it exists another WS s′, which can semantically undo the execution of s.

Definition 3 (Retriable WS). A WS is retriable (r) if it guarantees a successfully termination after a finite number of invocations.

A WS can combine behavioral properties, then the set of all possible combinations for a WS is {p,c,p⁢r,c⁢r}.","As composition web service is a cross-organizational collaborative system, unexpected behavior or failure implement of a component service might not only lead to its failure but

Then, s is said to be pivot ( p for short) if once it is successfully completed, its effects remain forever and cannot be semantically undone, and if it fails, it has no effect at all.

Definition 4 (Atomic CWS). A CWS is atomic if once all its component WSs complete successfully, their effect remains forever and cannot be semantically undone. On the other hand, if one component WS does not complete successfully, then all previously successful component WSs have to be compensated. In the following, a→ is used to indicate an atomic CWS while a~ is used to indicate a nonatomic one.

Definition 5 (Compensatable CWS). A CWS is compensatable (c) if all its component WSs are compensatable.

Definition 6 (Retriable CWS). An atomic or a compensatable CWS is retriable (r) if all its components are retriable.

Definition 7 (Transactional CWS). A Transactional Composite Web Service (TCWS) is a CWS whose transactional behavioral property is in {a→,a→⁢r,c,c⁢r}.

A TCWS takes advantage of component service behavioral properties to specify mechanisms for failure handling and recovery. It can be composed of elementary WSs, whose properties are in {p,p⁢r,c,c⁢r}, and/or can be composed of CWSs, whose properties are in {a→,a→⁢r,c,c⁢r}.",".2. Composite Web Service Transactional Property A composite Web service (CWS for short) is a conglomeration of existing Web services working in tandem to offer a new value-added service [17], which is often long-running, loosely coupled, and cross-organizational applications. It orchestrates a set of services, as a workflow-based composition, to achieve a common goal [18]. Transactional property of CWS depends on two sides, transactional property of every component service and workgroup patterns. Inspired by Mehrotra et al. [16], we have the following definitions.

Definition 2.1. Atomic property of CWS (a for short) is that if all component services are completed successfully, their effects remain forever and cannot be semantically undone, and if one component service cannot be completed successfully, previously successful component services have to be compensated. (In other words, if one component service fails, the execution result is compensated).

Definition 2.2. Compensatable property of CWS (c for short) is that all component services are compensatable.

Definition 2.3. Retriable property of CWS ( r for short) is that all component services are retriable.

Definition 2.4. Transactional Composite Web Service (TCS) is CWS whose transactional property is in {a,a⁢r,c,c⁢r}.",1264.68021_source_1.tex,1264.68021.tex,Deletions; Different Presentation; Insertions; Paraphrase

"In order to explain the transactional WS selection process, it is necessary to establish how the user can express their transactional criteria. Although, expressing the QoS criteria is significant for the user, the risk or the possibility that an application will be unsuccessfully executed has a more significant effect on the user’s decisions. The importance of the uncertainty of application completion and recovery is semantically expressed under a criterion called risk. For example, the set {a→,a→⁢r,c,c⁢r} of the behavioral properties of CWS can be divided into two subsets {a→,a⁢r→} and {c,c⁢r}, each one can be associated with a level of risk. For instance, in terms of the transactional properties, we believe that properties a→ and a→⁢r are riskier than c and c⁢r. Indeed, properties a→ and a⁢r→ mean that once a service has been executed, it cannot be rolled back. Therefore, we define two notions of execution risk in a transactional system (i.e., a system guaranteeing that if the execution is not successful, no result is reflected to the system) like:

•

Risk 0. The system guarantees that if the execution is successful, the obtained results can be compensated by the user (i.e., the user can execute another application that can semantically undo the previous one).

•

Risk 1. The system does not guarantee that the result can be compensated (or semantically undone) by the user in case of successful execution.","In order to explain the transactional Web service selection process, it is necessary to establish how the user can express their transactional criteria.

"6.2.1 Sequential Pattern Assignation

Proposition 1. In a sequential pattern, if the WS assigned to the first activity of the pattern is pivot (p), pivot retriable (p⁢r), atomic (a→), or atomic retriable (a→⁢r), then, to obtain a TCWS, the WS assigned to the second activity should be pivot retriable (pr), atomic retriable (a⁢r→), or compensatable retriable (cr). The Transactional Property (TP) of the resulting TCWS is atomic (a→) and is moreover atomic retriable (a⁢r→) if all its components are retriable.

Proof. If the WS assigned to the first activity of the pattern is p, p⁢r,a→, or a→⁢r, then, by definition (see Definitions 1 and 4 ), its effects cannot be semantically undone, thus the execution of the second WS should guarantee a successfully termination. The only condition to guarantee a successfully termination is the retriable property (see Definitions 3 and 6). Therefore, the WS assigned to the second activity should be p⁢r,a→⁢r, or c⁢r.

Proposition 2. In a sequential pattern, if the WS assigned to the first activity of the pattern is compensatable (c) or compensatable retriable (cr), then the resulting CWS is always transactional (TCWS) whatever the TP of the WS assigned to the second activity is. The TP of the resulting TCWS is atomic (a→) if the WS assigned to the second activity is either pivot (p), pivot retriable ( pr ), atomic (a→), or atomic retriable TABLE 2

(a⁢r→). The TCWS TP is compensatable (c) if the WS assigned to the second activity is either compensatable (c) or compensatable retriable (cr). Moreover, when both component WSs are retriable, the resulting TCWS is retriable.

Proof. When service W⁢S1 assigned to the first activity of the pattern is c or c⁢r, the resulting CWS is at least a→ (see Definition 4) because if the WS assigned to the second activity fails, then W⁢S1 can be compensated. Moreover, the resulting CWS is c (see Definition 5) when the WS assigned to the second activity is c or c⁢r, because all the components of the resulting CWS are c.

6.2.2 Parallel Pattern Assignation

Proposition 3. If a pivot ( p ) or an atomic ( a→ ) WS is assigned to one activity of a parallel pattern, then the WS assigned to the other activity should be compensatable retriable (cr) to obtain a TCWS. The transactional property of the resulting TCWS is atomic (a→).

Proof. If a p or an a→ Web service W⁢S1 is assigned to one activity of a parallel pattern and if it successfully completes, then, by definition (see Definitions 1 and 4 ), its effects cannot be semantically undone. Therefore, the execution of the other WS should guarantee a successfully termination in case of W⁢S1 successfully termination and should be able to be compensated in case of W⁢S1 failure. By definition (see Definitions 3 and 6), the only condition to guarantee a successfully termination which can be compensated is property c⁢r. Consequently, the WS assigned to the other activity of the pattern should be c⁢r.

Proposition 4. If a pivot retriable ( p⁢r ) or an atomic retriable (a⁢r→ ) WS is assigned to one activity of a parallel pattern, then the WS assigned to the other activity should be pivot retriable (pr), atomic retriable (a⁢r→), or compensatable retriable (cr) in order to obtain a TCWS. The transactional property of the resulting TCWS is atomic retriable (a⁢r→).

Proof. If a p⁢r or an a⁢r→ service W⁢S1 is assigned to one activity of a parallel pattern, then, by definition (see Definitions 3 and 6), it guarantees a successfully termination, but it cannot be compensated. Thus, the WS assigned to other activity cannot fail. So to obtain a TCWS, the only TABLE 3

solution is to assign a p⁢r,c⁢r, or a⁢r→ WS to the other activity of the pattern.

Proposition 5. If a compensatable (c) WS is assigned to one activity of a parallel pattern, then the WS assigned to the other activity should be compensatable (c) or compensatable retriable (cr) in order to obtain a TCWS. The transactional property of the resulting TCWS is compensatable (c).

Proof. If a c service W⁢S1 is assigned to one activity of a parallel pattern and if it successfully completes, then, by definition (see Definitions 2 and 5), its effects can be semantically undone. But it can fail. Therefore, to obtain a TCWS, the WS assigned to the other activity of the pattern should be at least c (and possibly c⁢r ) in order to be able to be compensated.

Proposition 6. If a compensatable retriable (cr) WS is assigned to one activity of a parallel pattern, then the resulting CWS is transactional (TCWS) independently of the WS transactional property assigned to the other activity. The transactional property of the resulting TCWS is, respectively, atomic (a→), compensatable (c), atomic retriable (a⁢r→), or compensatable retriable (cr), if the WS assigned to the other activity is, respectively, pivot/atomic (p/a→), compensatable (c), pivot/ atomic retriable ( pr/a⁢r→), or compensatable retriable (cr).

Proof. If a c⁢r WS is assigned to one activity of a parallel pattern, then, by definition (see Definitions 2, 3, 5, and 6), it guarantees a successfully termination and it can be compensated. Hence, whatever is the property of the WS assigned to the other activity, the resulting TCWS is at least a→ (see Definition 4). Moreover, the resulting TCWS is c when the service assigned to the second activity is c or c⁢r because all the components of the resulting TCWS are c. It is retriable when the WS assigned to the second activity is p⁢r,a→⁢r, or c⁢r because all its components are r.","3.2.1. Services Selection Rule in the Sequential Pattern Rule 1. One has CWS =(ES,TP,PA)∧(ES=Si∪Si+1)∧tp(Si)={p,a,pr, ar }∧PA= SEQ(Si,Si+1)→tp(Si+1)={pr,ar,cr}∧((tp(Si)={pr,ar}→tp(CWS)∈{ar})∨(tp(Si)= {p,a}→tp(CWS)∈{a})).

From Rule 1 we can find if previous service transactional property is p,a,pr, or ar in the sequential pattern, and to obtain selected TCS the candidate service transactional property of next activity is pr, ar, or cr. CWS transactional property is a or ar and is moreover ar if all its components are retriable.

Proof. tp⁡(Si)={p,a,pr,ar} expresses effects of the previous service which cannot be semantically undone, and in the sequential pattern the next should ensure successful execution. Therefore the next transactional property must be retriable, pr, ar, or cr.

Rule 2. One has CWS =(ES,TP,PA)∧(ES=Si∪Si+1)∧tp⁡(Si)={c,cr}∧PA=SEQ⁡(Si,Si+1)→ tp(Si+1)=P∧((tp(Si+1)={c,cr}→tp( CWS )∈{c,cr})∨(¬tp(Si+1)={c,cr}→tp(CWS)∈ {a,ar})).

From Rule 2 we can find if previous service transactional property is c or cr in the sequential pattern, and to obtain selected TCS the candidate service transactional property of next activity is not required, as long as the next service is transactional service. When the WS assigned to the next activity is either c or crCWS transactional property is c or cr. Moreover, when both component services are r, the resulting TCS is r.

Proof. Because the previous service transactional property is c or cr, if the next service failed the previous service is compensatable. Therefore whatever transactional property of next activity is, CWS is transactional.

6 Mathematical Problems in Engineering 3.2.2. Services Selection Rule in the Parallel Pattern Rule 3. One has CWS =(ES,TP,PA)∧(ES=Si∪Si+1)∧PA=PAR⁡(Si,Si+1)∧tp⁡(Si)={p,a}→ tp(Si+1)={cr}∧tp( CWS )=a.

Rule 3 is applied to parallel pattern. Si and Si+1 are branches of parallel pattern. If assigned service transactional property of one activity is p or a, the other assigned parallel service should be cr.

Proof. In parallel pattern, when assigned service transactional property of one activity is p or a, if it is completed successfully, and its effect is not semantically undone, therefore, the other assigned parallel service is retriable (r), which can guarantee a successfully termination. If it failed, the other should be compensatable (c). So to ensure a successful termination and be compensatable simultaneously, transactional property of the other selected services should only be cr. From Definitions 2.1-2.3, TCS is a.

Rule 4. One has CWS =(ES,TP,PA)∧(ES=Si∪Si+1)∧PA=PAR⁡(Si,Si+1)∧tp⁡(Si)={pr,ar}→ tp⁡(Si+1)={pr,ar,cr}∧tp⁡(CWS)=ar.

Rule 4 is applied to parallel pattern. Si and Si+1 are branches of parallel pattern. If assigned service transactional property of one activity is pror ar, the other selected parallel service should be pr, ar, or cr, and TCS is ar.

Proof. In parallel pattern, when assigned service transactional property of one activity is pr or ar, it can ensure to be completed successfully. Therefore the other assigned parallel service is pr, ar, or cr. From Definitions 2.1-2.3, TCS is ar.

Rule 5. One has CWS =(ES,TP,PA)∧(ES=Si∪Si+1)∧PA=PAR⁡(Si,Si+1)∧tp⁡(Si)={c}→ tp⁡(Si+1)={c,cr}∧tp⁡(CWS)=c.

Rule 5 is applied to parallel pattern. Si and Si+1 are branches of parallel pattern. If assigned service transactional property of one activity is c, the other selected parallel service should be c or cr, and TCS is c.

Proof. In parallel pattern, when assigned service transactional property of one activity is c, it offers compensation policies to semantically undo its effects, but it can fail. Therefore, the other assigned parallel service is c or cr. From Definition 2.2, TCS is c.

Rule 6. One has CWS =(ES,TP,PA)∧(ES=Si∪Si+1)∧PA=PAR⁡(Si,Si+1)∧tp⁡(Si)={cr}→ (tp(Si+1)={p,a}→tp(CWS)=a)∨(tp(Si+1)={pr,ar}→tp(CWS)=ar)∨(tp(Si+1)= {c}→tp(CWS)=c)∨(tp(Si+1)={cr}→tp(CWS)=cr).

Rule 6 is applied to parallel pattern. Si and Si+1 are branches of parallel pattern. If assigned service transactional property of one activity is cr, the other selected parallel service should be in set of {p,a,pr, ar, c,cr}. When the other is p/a,pr/ar,c, or cr, corresponding to transactional property of CWS is a, ar, c, or cr.

Proof. In parallel pattern, when assigned service transactional property of one activity is cr, it offers compensation policies to semantically undo its effects, and it can ensure to be completed successfully. Therefore, the other selected parallel service is only transactional service.",1264.68021_source_1.tex,1264.68021.tex,Paraphrase; Different Presentation; Text-to-Math; Insertions; Deletions

Indeed, the former provides additional functionality in order to guarantee that the result can be undone. Similarly, we believe that a retriable WS has an execution duration higher than a nonretriable one.

The second scenario is a variant of the first one in which the intervals of values for the criteria price and duration overlap of 20 percent.

Definition 1 Pivot. A service is said to be pivot if its behavior supports atomic transactions. In other word, a service is pivot if once it successfully completes, its effects remains forever and cannot be semantically undone. On one hand, there is no guarantee that this type of service can be executed successfully and if it fails it has no effect at all. On the other hand, a completed pivot service cannot be rolled back.

Definition 2 Compensatable. A service is said to be compensatable if its behavior supports compensatable transactions. In other words, a service is compensatable if it is able to offer operations to semantically undo the original activity effect.

Next, among behavioral properties of a Web service other than transaction, let us consider the behavioral property called retriable (r). More precisely, we have the following definition.

Definition 3 Retriable. A service is retriable if it guarantees a successfully termination after a finite number of invocations. In other words, a service with this property is able to offer forward recovery.

Naturally, a service can combine behavioral properties. For instance, a service can combine pivot property and retriable property which leads to a new behavioral property

"in order to explain the services selection process, it is necessary to establish how the user can express their transactional criteria. Although, for the user expressing its transactional criteria is significant, the risk or probability that a transaction will be unsuccessful have a more significant effect on its decision. The importance of the uncertainty of transaction completion and recovery is semantically expressed under a factor (criteria) called the risk. Under this notion, the set {a→,c,p⁢r,c⁢r} of the behavioral properties of composite Web service can be divided into two subsets {a→,p⁢r} and {c,c⁢r} each one of them representing a level of risk. For instance, in terms of the transactional properties, we believe that properties a→ and p⁢r are riskier than c and c⁢r but that they will costs less than properties c and c⁢r. Indeed, to have a composite Web service with property c or c⁢r we have to select only component Web services with properties c or c⁢r (see Section 2.3.1). In both cases, as we mentioned above, this will have either a higher execution price or a higher execution duration. Therefore, we define two notions of risk of execution in a transactional system like:

Risk 0 : the system guarantees that if the execution is successful, the obtained results can be compensated by the user.

Risk 1: the system does not guarantee the successful execution but if it achieves the results cannot be compensated by the user.","In order to explain the transactional Web service selection process, it is necessary to establish how the user can express their transactional criteria. We define risk tolerance which expresses importance of the uncertainty of application completion and recovery. In terms of the transactional properties for CWS, we believe that properties a and ar are riskier than c and cr. Indeed, properties a and ar mean that once a service has been executed, it cannot be rolled back. Therefore, we define two levels of risk tolerance in a transactional system. Risk Tolerance 0 The system guarantees that if the execution is successful, the obtained results can be compensated by the user. In this level the selecting process generates a compensatable workflow. Risk Tolerance 1 The system does not guarantee the successful execution but if it is achieved the results cannot be compensated by the user.",1264.68021_source_2.tex,1264.68021.tex,Deletions; Formula Manipulation; Paraphrase
"In the experimentation, in order to give a semantic meaning to the risk notion, we have considered a scenario where the execution duration and execution price of a Web service depend on additional operations required to guaranty their transactional properties. Then we defined the risk notion for this scenario. Under these conditions the implementation shows that the QoS of transactional composite Web service depends on the user preferences. If the execution price is important (i.e., price minimum) to the user then the better solutions are the riskier ones. A contrario, if the execution duration is more important (i.e., execution time minimum) to the user then the lowest level of risk is better.","In the experimentation, in order to give a semantic meaning to the risk notion, we have considered two scenarios where the execution duration and execution price of a WS depend on additional operations required to guarantee their transactional properties.

If the execution price criterion is important to the user, the better solutions are the ones with the lowest level of risk. If the execution duration criterion is more important to the user, then the riskier solutions are the best ones.

It is clear from (12) that the set {κk}-∞,k≠0∞ is the union of the sets ⋃j=13{νk(j)}-∞,k≠0∞, i.e., the spectra of the auxiliary problems Lj,j=1,2,3. According to the remark presented in Section 1, all numbers λk,νk(j),j=1,2,3 and κk are real and nonzero. We enumerate the sets {λk}-∞,k≠0∞,{νk(j)}-∞,k≠0∞,j=1,2,3 and {κk}-∞,k≠0∞ in the proper way (λ-k=-λk, λk≤λk+1,ν-k(j)=-νk(j),νk(j)<νk+1(j) for j=1,2,3 and κ-k=-κk,κk≤κk+1). Note that the sets of eigenvalues {νk(j)}-∞,k≠0∞,j=1,2,3 behave asypmtotically as follows(see [16, section 1.5]):

	νk(j)	=k⁢πa+Bjπ⁢k+δk(j)k,j=1,2,	
	νk(3)	=π⁢(k-12)a+B3π⁢(k-12)+δk(3)k,	

where {δk(j)}-∞⁢k≠0∞∈l2 for j=1,2,3. Let us denote by Ld,d>0 the class(introduced in [13, p. 149]) of entire functions of exponential type ≤d whose restrictions on the real line belong to L2⁢(-∞,∞). Lemma 3.2. The functions Φ⁢(λ) and Ψ⁢(λ) can be represented as follows:

 where ⁢ω1⁢(λ),ω2⁢(λ)∈L3⁢a.

Theorem 3.3. The set {λk}-∞,k≠0∞ of zeros of Φ⁢(λ) can be represented as the union of three pairwise disjoint subsequences ⋃j=13{λk(j)}-∞,k≠0∞ which being enumerated in the following way: λ-k(1)=-λk(1),λ-k(2)=-λk(3),λ-k(3)=-λk(2) and λk(j)≤λk+1(j) for j=1,2,3, behave asymptotically as follows: where {γk(j)}-∞,k≠0∞∈l2 for j=1,2,3. Proof. In the same way as [22, Lemma 1.3], we can show that the set of zeros {λk}-∞,k≠0∞ can be arranged into three pairwise disjoint subsequences {λk(j)}-∞,k≠0∞, j=1,2,3 enumerated in the following way: λ-k(1)=-λk(1),λ-k(2)=-λk(3),λ-k(3)=-λk(2) and λk(j)≤λk+1(j) for j=1,2,3, such that {λk}-∞,k≠0∞=⋃j=13{λk(j)}-∞,k≠0∞, and

	λk(1)	=k⁢πa+εk(1),	
	λk(j)	=k⁢π+(-1)j⁢sin-1⁡23a+εk(j),j=2,3,	

where εk(j)=o⁢(1), as k→∞ for j=1,2,3. It is not difficult to see that

	
εk(j)=O⁢(1k),k→∞,j=1,2,3.
	

Substituting (23) into λk(1)⁢Φ⁢(λk(1))=0, then from (15) and taking into account that the function ω1⁢(λ) is bounded on the real axis by the Paley-Wiener theorem, we obtain

	λk(1)⁢Φ⁢(λk(1))=	(-1)k⁢(2⁢sin⁡εk(1)⁢a-3⁢sin3⁡εk(1)⁢a)	
		+(-1)k⁢a⁢(2⁢B1+2⁢B2+3⁢B3+β)⁢sin2⁡εk(1)⁢a⁢cos⁡εk(1)⁢ak⁢π

I. Dehghani Tazehkand and A. Jodayree Akbarfam - Determination of Sturm-…

	
=(-1)k⁢2⁢sin⁡εk(1)⁢a+O⁢(1k)=0,k→∞.
	

This yields sin⁡εk(1)⁢a=O⁢(1k). Thus, εk(1)=O⁢(1k). Similarly, we can show that εk(j)=O⁢(1k) for j=2,3. Substituting (23) into the equation λk(1)⁢Φ⁢(λk(1))=0 where Φ⁢(λ) is given by (15), by expanding the left-hand side of resulting equation in power series and taking into account (25) and {ω1⁢(λk(1))}-∞,k≠0∞∈l2 (see [16, Lemma 1.4.3]), we obtain

	
2⁢εk(1)⁢a-a⁢(B1+B2)k⁢π+τkk=0,
	

where {τk}-∞,k≠0∞∈l2. Solving this equation we get (21). In the same way, we get (22).

To compare necessary conditions on a sequence to be the spectrum of the boundaryvalue problem L0 with the sufficient condition which will be obtained in Section 4 , we need more precise asymptotics.

Theorem 3.4. Let qj⁢(x)∈W21⁢(0,a) for j=1,2,3. Then the subsequences of Theorem 3.3 behave asymptotically as follows:

	λk(1)	=k⁢πa+B1+B22⁢k⁢π+γk(1)k2,	
	λk(j)	=k⁢π+(-1)j⁢sin-1⁡23a+3⁢B1+3⁢B2+6⁢B3+2⁢β12⁢k⁢π+γk(j)k2,j=2,3,	

where {γk(j)}-∞,k≠0∞∈l2 for j=1,2,3 Proof. If qj⁢(x)∈W21⁢(0,a), twice integrating by parts the formulas of [7, p. 18] and [16, p. 9], we obtain

	
uj⁢(a,λ)=sin⁡λ⁢aλ-Bj⁢cos⁡λ⁢aλ2+Dj⁢sin⁡λ⁢aλ3+ϱj⁢(λ)λ3,j=1,2,

	Φ⁢(λ)=	2⁢sin⁡λ⁢a-3⁢sin3⁡λ⁢aλ+(2⁢B1+2⁢B2+3⁢B3+β)⁢sin2⁡λ⁢a⁢cos⁡λ⁢aλ2	
		-(B1+B2)⁢cos3⁡λ⁢aλ2+E1⁢sin3⁡λ⁢aλ3+E2⁢cos2⁡λ⁢a⁢sin⁡λ⁢aλ3+ω3⁢(λ)λ3,

Remark 3.5. Under the conditions of Theorem 3.4, the spectra {νk(j)}-∞,k≠0∞ of the boundary-value problems Lj for j=1,2,3 behave asymptotically as follows(see [16, p. 75]):

	νk(j)	=k⁢πa+Bjπ⁢k+δk(j)k2,j=1,2,	
	νk(3)	=π⁢(k-12)a+B3π⁢(k-12)+δk(3)k2,	

where {δk(j)}-∞,k≠0∞∈l2 for j=1,2,3. For investigation of direct and inverse spectral problems, methods of the theory of entire and meromorphic functions are widely used. For this reason, we give several notation and definitions for what follows.

If Ω⊆ℂ is an open set, we denote by ℋ⁢(Ω) the set of all functions which are analytic in Ω and by ℳ⁢(Ω) the set of all functions meromorphic in Ω. Definition 3.6. ([25]) Let 𝒦⊆ℳ⁢(ℂ) and let φ,ψ∈ℋ⁢(ℂ). i. The pair (φ,ψ) is called a 1- 𝒦-pair, if ψ-1⁢φ∈𝒦 and φ and ψ have no common zeros. ii. Let n∈ℕ and n≥2. The pair (φ,ψ) is called an n - 𝒦-pair, if ψ-1⁢φ∈𝒦, there exist 1- 𝒦-pairs (φ1,ψ1),…,(φn,ψn) such that

	
ψ=∏i=1nψi,φ=∑i=1n(φi⁢∏j=1
j≠iψj),
	

and no representation of this kind is possible with less than n many 1-K 𝒦-pairs. 159

I. Dehghani Tazehkand and A. Jodayree Akbarfam - Determination of Sturm-… Definition 3.7. ([25] A function f∈ℋ⁢(ℂ\ℝ) is said to be of Nevanlinna class 𝒩 if i. f⁢(z)=f⁢(z¯)¯ for z∈ℂ\ℝ; ii. Im⁡f⁢(z)≥0 for Im⁡z>0. Definition 3.8.([25]) The class 𝒩e⁢p of essentially positive Nenalinna functions is defined as the set of all functions f∈𝒩 which are analytic in ℂ\[0,∞) with possible exception of finitely many poles. Moreover, the class 𝒩-e⁢p is defined as the set of all functions f∈𝒩 such that for some b∈ℝ we have f∈ℋ⁢(ℂ\[b,∞)) and f⁢(z)≤0 for z∈(-∞,b). It is easy to check that 𝒩-e⁢p⊆𝒩e⁢p. Definition 3.9. ([15]) An entire function ω⁢(z) of exponential type σ>0 is said to be a function of sine-type if it satisfies the following conditions: i. all the zeros of ω⁢(z) lie in a strip |Im⁡z|<h<∞; ii. for some h1 and all z∈{λ:Im⁡z=h1}, the following equalities hold:

	
0<m≤|ω⁢(z)|≤M<∞;
	

iii. the type of ω⁢(z) in the lower half-plane coincides with that in the upper halfplane. Let us introduce the entire functions

	ψj⁢(z)	=uj⁢(a,z),j=1,2,3	
	φ⁢(z)	=-Φ⁢(z),ψ⁢(z)=Ψ⁢(z).

Lemma 3.10. 1. The zeros of the functions φj⁢(z) and ψj⁢(z)⁢(j=1,2,3) are real; 2. The functions φj⁢(z) and ψj⁢(z)⁢(j=1,2,3) have no common zeros. Proof. The zeros of φj⁢(z),j=1,2,3 coincide with the squares of the eigenvalues of the boundary-value problems

respectively, and the zeros of ψj⁢(z) coincide with the squares of the eigenvalues of the boundary-value problems Lj,j=1,2,3, respectively. These problems are self-adjoint and it follows from [20, Part I, Theorem 3] that the squares of their eigenvalues are real. Assertion 1 is proved. To prove assertion 2, let z0 be a common zero of φj⁢(z) and ψj⁢(z). Using to Lagrange identity(see [20, Part II, p. 50]) for solutions uj⁢(a,z) and uj⁢(a,z0) of (1) we obtain

	(z-z0)⁢∫0auj⁢(x,z)⁢uj⁢(x,z0)⁢𝑑x	=(uj⁢(x,z)⁢uj′⁢(x,z0)-uj′⁢(x,z)⁢uj⁢(x,z0))|0a	
		=φj⁢(z)⁢ψj⁢(z0)-φj⁢(z0)⁢ψj⁢(z).	

For z→z0 we get

	
∫0auj2⁢(x,z0)⁢𝑑x=φ˙j⁢(z0)⁢ψj⁢(z0)-φj⁢(z0)⁢ψ˙j⁢(z0)=0,
	

where φ˙j⁢(z)=dd⁢z⁢φj⁢(z) and ψ˙j⁢(z)=dd⁢z⁢ψj⁢(z). This implies that uj⁢(x,z0)≡0 which is a contradiction. Therefore, φj⁢(z) and ψj⁢(z) have no common zeros.

Lemma 3.11. The functions φj⁢(z)ψj⁢(z),j=1,2,3 and φ⁢(z)ψ⁢(z) are of the Nevanlinna class 𝒩.

Proof. Let j∈{1,2,3}. Using the Lagrange identity for the solution uj⁢(a,z) of (1), we have

	
(uj′⁢(x,z)¯uj(x,z)-uj′(x,z)uj⁢(x,z)¯))|0a=2iImz∫0a|uj(x,z)|2dx
	

161

I. Dehghani Tazehkand and A. Jodayree Akbarfam - Determination of Sturm-… Since

	
Im⁡(uj′⁢(a,z)¯⁢uj⁢(a,z)-uj′⁢(a,z)⁢uj⁢(a,z)¯)=-2⁢|uj⁢(a,z)|2⁢Im⁡uj′⁢(a,z)uj⁢(a,z),
	

then (40) yields

	
-Im⁡uj′⁢(a,z)uj⁢(a,z)=Im⁡z⁢∫0a|uj⁢(x,z)|2⁢𝑑x|uj⁢(a,z)|2,Im⁡z≠0.
	

Thus,

	
Im⁡(-uj′⁢(a,z)uj⁢(a,z))≥0  for ⁢Im⁡z>0
	

and consequently

	
Im⁡φj⁢(z)ψj⁢(z)=Im⁡(-uj′⁢(a,z)uj⁢(a,z)-β3)≥0  for ⁢Im⁡z>0.
	

Also, according to Lemma 3.10 the zeros of φj⁢(z) and ψj⁢(z) are real and hence φj⁢(z)ψj⁢(z)∈ℋ⁢(ℂ\ℝ). Therefore φj⁢(z)ψj⁢(z)∈𝒩. Now it follows from (39) and (41) that φ⁢(z)ψ⁢(z)∈ℋ⁢(ℂ\ℝ) and

	
Im⁡φ⁢(z)ψ⁢(z)=∑j=13Im⁡φj⁢(z)ψj⁢(z)≥0  for ⁢Im⁡z>0.
	

Consequently φ⁢(z)ψ⁢(z)∈𝒩. Lemma 3.11 is proved. Lemma 3.12. The functions φj⁢(z)ψj⁢(z),j=1,2,3 and φ⁢(z)ψ⁢(z) are of the class 𝒩-e⁢p. Proof. By virtue of the formulas (17)-(20) we get

	
uj⁢(a,z)=e|z|⁢a2⁢|z|⁢(1+o⁢(1)),z→-∞,j=1,2,
u3⁢(a,z)=e|z|⁢a2⁢(1+o⁢(1)),z→-∞,
uj′⁢(a,z)=e|z|⁢a2⁢(1+o⁢(1)),z→-∞,j=1,2,
u3′⁢(a,z)=|z|⁢e|z|⁢a2⁢(1+o⁢(1)),z→-∞.
	

162

I. Dehghani Tazehkand and A. Jodayree Akbarfam - Determination of Sturm- … Using these asymptotics we obtain from (35) and (36)

	
φj⁢(z)ψj⁢(z)=-|z|⁢(1+o⁢(1)),z→-∞,j=1,2,3,
	

and consequently

	
limz→-∞⁡φj⁢(z)ψj⁢(z)=-∞,j=1,2,3.
	

It follows form Lemma 3.10, Lemma 3.11 and (42) that there exist real numbers bj∈ℝ,j=1,2,3 such that

	
φj⁢(z)ψj⁢(z)∈𝒩∩H⁢(ℂ\[bj,∞)),φj⁢(z)ψj⁢(z)<0  for ⁢z∈(-∞,bj).
	

Therefore, φj⁢(z)ψj⁢(z)∈𝒩-e⁢p for j=1,2,3. Now using (39) and (43) and Lemma 3.11 we conclude that

	
φ⁢(z)ψ⁢(z)∈𝒩∩ℋ⁢(ℂ\[b,∞)),φ⁢(z)ψ⁢(z)=∑j=13φj⁢(z)ψj⁢(z)<0  for ⁢z∈(-∞,b),
	

where b=min⁡{b1,b2,b3}. Thus, φ⁢(z)ψ⁢(z)∈𝒩-e⁢p. Lemma 3.12 is proved. Theorem 3.13 The sequences {λk}-∞,k≠0∞ and {κk}-∞,k≠0∞ satisfy the following conditions: 1. 0<λ1<κ1≤λ2≤κ2≤⋯≤λk≤κk≤⋯ (λ-k=-λk,κ-k=-κk); 2. κk=λk+1 if and only if λk+1=κk+1 for k∈ℕ; 3. The maximal multiplicity of κk is 3 . Proof. Denote 𝒩-e⁢p:=ℳ⁢(ℂ)∩𝒩-e⁢p. The functions uj⁢(a,z) and uj′⁢(a,z) are entire in z and hence in view of Lemma 3.12, φj⁢(z)ψj⁢(z)∈𝒩˙-e⁢p for j=1,2,3 and φ⁢(z)ψ⁢(z)∈𝒩-e⁢p. Also, by Lemma 3.10 the functions φj⁢(z),ψj⁢(z) have no common zeros. Therefore the pairs (φj,ψj),j=1,2,3 are 1 - 𝒩˙-e⁢p-pairs and consequently, in view of (38) the pair (φ,ψ) is an m - 𝒩-e⁢p-pair with some m≤3 (see Definition 3.6). On the other hand by virtue of (37), the squares of the zeros of Φ⁢(λ) and Ψ⁢(λ) coincide with the zeros of φ⁢(z) and ψ⁢(z), respectively. Now the assertions of Theorem 3.13 immediately follows from [25, Corollary 4.6]. 4. InVERSE PROBLEM In the present section, we study the problem of reconstruction of the potential q⁢(x)= [qj⁢(x)]j=1,2,3 and the real numbers h,β from the given spectral characteristics. Let us denote by Q the class of sets {[qj⁢(x)]j=1,2,3,h,β} which satisfy the following conditions: 163

I. Dehghani Tazehkand and A. Jodayree Akbarfam - Determination of Sturm-… i. qj⁢(x),j=1,2,3 are real-valued functions from L2⁢(0,a); ii. h,β∈ℝ; iii. the operator A constructed via (4), (5) is strictly positive. Theorem 4.1. Let the following conditions be satisfied : 1. Three sequences {νk(j)}-∞,k≠0∞,j=1,2,3 of real numbers are such that i. ν-k(j)=-νk(j),νk(j)<νk+1(j),νk(j)≠0 for all k∈ℕ and j=1,2,3; ii. {νk(i)}-∞,k≠0∞∩{νk(j)}-∞,k≠0∞=∅ for i≠j,i,j=1,2,3; iii.

	νk(j)	=π⁢ka+Bjπ⁢k+δk(j)k2,j=1,2,	
	νk(3)	=π⁢(k-12)a+B3π⁢(k-12)+δk(3)k2,	

where Bj are real constants, Bi≠Bj for i≠j and {δk(j)}-∞,k≠0∞∈l2 for j=1,2,3. 2. A sequence {λk}-∞,k≠0∞ of real numbers (λ-k=-λk,λk≤λk+1,λk≠0 for all k∈ℕ) can be represented as the union of three pairwise disjoint subsequences {λk}-∞,k≠0∞=⋃j=13{λk(j)}-∞,k≠0∞⁢λ-k(1)=-λk(1),λ-k(2)=-λk(3),λ-k(3)=-λk(2) and λk(j)≤λk+1(j) for j=1,2,3) which behave asymptotically as follows:

	λk(1)	=k⁢πa+B1+B22⁢k⁢π+γk(1)k2,	
	λk(j)	=k⁢π+(-1)j⁢sin-1⁡23a+B0k⁢π+γk(j)k2,j=2,3,	

where B0 is a real constant and {γk(j)}-∞,k≠0∞∈l2 for j=1,2,3. 3. The sequences {λk}-∞,k≠0∞ and {κk}-∞∞:=⋃j=13{νk(j)}-∞,k≠0∞⋃{0}(κ-k=-κk, κk<κk+1) interlace in the following strict sense:

	
⋯<κ-2<λ-2<κ-1<λ-1<κ0=0<λ1<κ1<λ2<κ2<⋯.
	

Then there exists a unique set {[qj⁢(x)]j=1,2,3,h,β}∈Q such that the sequence {λk}-∞,k≠0∞ coincides with the spectrum of the boundary-value problem L0, where 164

	{ρk(0)}-∞,k≠0∞	:={π⁢k-ξa}-∞,k≠0∞⁢⋃{π⁢k+ξa}-∞,k≠0∞,ξ:=sin-1⁡23,	
	{ρk}-∞,k≠0∞	:={λk(2)}-∞,k≠0∞⁢⋃{λk(3)}-∞,k≠0∞.	

It is possible to enumerate {ρk(0)}-∞,k≠0∞ and {ρk}-∞,k≠0∞ in the proper way (ρ-k(0)= -ρk(0),ρk(0)<ρk+1(0) and ρ-k=-ρk,ρk≤ρk+1). Let us construct the following entire functions:

	
uj⁢(λ)=a⁢∏1∞(a2π2⁢k2⁢(νk(j)⁢2-λ2)),j=1,2,
u3⁢(λ)=∏1∞(a2π2⁢(k-1/2)2⁢(νk(3)⁢2-λ2))
ϕ1⁢(λ)=a⁢∏1∞(a2π2⁢k2⁢(λk(1)⁢2-λ2))
ϕ2⁢(λ)=2⁢∏1∞(1ρk(0)⁢2⁢(ρk2-λ2)).
	

Using [21, Lemma 2.1], we obtain

	
uj⁢(λ)=sin⁡λ⁢aλ-Bj⁢cos⁡λ⁢aλ2+Fj⁢sin⁡λ⁢aλ3+fj⁢(λ)λ3,j=1,2,
	

where Fj,j=1,2 are constants and fj⁢(λ)∈La for j=1,2. In the same way as [21, Lemma 2.1] we can prove that

	
u3⁢(λ)=cos⁡λ⁢a+B3⁢sin⁡λ⁢aλ+F3⁢cos⁡λ⁢aλ2+f3⁢(λ)λ2
ϕ1⁢(λ)=sin⁡λ⁢aλ-(B1+B22)⁢cos⁡λ⁢aλ2+G1⁢sin⁡λ⁢aλ3+g1⁢(λ)λ3
ϕ2⁢(λ)=2-3⁢sin2⁡λ⁢a+3⁢B0⁢sin⁡2⁢λ⁢aλ+G2⁢2-3⁢sin2⁡λ⁢aλ2+g2⁢(λ)λ2,
	

where F3,Gj,j=1,2 are constants and f3⁢(λ),g1⁢(λ)∈La and g2⁢(λ)∈L2⁢a. 165

I. Dehghani Tazehkand and A. Jodayree Akbarfam - Determination of Sturm- … Let us set

	
Xk(j):=νk(j)⁢(ϕ1⁢(νk(j))⁢ϕ2⁢(νk(j))ui⁢(νk(j))⁢u3⁢(νk(j))-cos⁡νk(j)⁢a-Bj⁢sin⁡νk(j)νk(j)),i,j=1,2,i≠j,
Xk(3):=(ϕ1⁢(νk(3))⁢ϕ2⁢(νk(3))u1⁢(νk(3))⁢u2⁢(νk(3))+νk(3)⁢sin⁡νk(3)⁢a-B3⁢cos⁡νk(3)⁢a)
	

where the numbers Bj,j=1,2,3 can be determined by

	
Bj=limk→∞⁡k⁢π⁢(νk(j)-π⁢ka),j=1,2,
B3=limk→∞⁡π⁢(k-12)⁢(νk(3)-π⁢(k-12)a).
	

It is clear that X-k(j)=-Xk(j) for j=1,2 and X-k(3)=Xk(3). To complete the proof we need the following lemma. Lemma 4.2.

	
{Xk(j)}-∞,k≠0∞∈l2  for ⁢j=1,2,3⁢. 
	

Proof. Substituting (44) into (53)-(56), we obtain

	
u2⁢(νk(1))=(-1)k⁢a2⁢(B1-B2)π2⁢k2+ζk(1)k3,
u3⁢(νk(1))=(-1)k⁢(1-a2⁢B122⁢π2⁢k2+a2⁢B1⁢B3π2⁢k2+a2⁢F3π2⁢k2)+ζk(2)k2,
ϕ1⁢(νk(1))=(-1)k⁢a2⁢(B1-B2)π2⁢k2+ζk(3)k3,
ϕ2⁢(νk(1))=2+ζk(4)k,
	

where {ζk(j)}-∞,k≠0∞∈l2 for j=1,4¯. Also, Using (44), we obtain the asymptotic relation

	
cos⁡νk(1)⁢a+B1⁢sin⁡νk(1)νk(1)=(-1)k⁢(1+ηkk),
	

166

I. Dehghani Tazehkand and A. Jodayree Akbarfam - Determination of Sturm-… where {ηk}-∞,k≠0∞∈l2. If we substitute (62)-(66) into (57), then we conclude that {Xk(1)}-∞,k≠0∞∈l2. Analogously we can show that {Xk(2)}-∞,k≠0∞∈l2. We show that {Xk(3)}-∞,k≠0∞∈l2. Let us substitute (45) into (53)-(56). We obtain

	
uj⁢(νk(3))=(-1)k+1νk(3)⁢(1+ζk′⁢(j)k),j=1,2,
ϕ1⁢(νk(3))=(-1)k+1νk(3)⁢(1+ζk′⁣(3)k),
ϕ2⁢(νk(3))=-1+ζk′⁣(4)k,
	

where {ζk′⁣(j)}-∞,k≠0∞∈l2 for j=1,4¯. Furthermore, taking into account (45), we have

	
νk(3)⁢sin⁡νk(3)⁢a-B3⁢cos⁡νk(3)⁢a=(-1)k+1⁢νk(3)⁢(1+ηk′k),
	

where {η′}-∞,k≠0∞∈l2. Using (67)-(70) in (58), the assertion of Lemma 4.2 for j=3 follows.

Now Since the functions λ⁢uj⁢(λ),j=1,2 and u3⁢(λ) are sine-type functions (see Definition 3.9) and by virtue of (44), (45) and (48), infk≠p⁡|νk(j)-νp(j)|>0 for j=1,2,3 (and hence the zeros of λ⁢uj⁢(λ),j=1,2 and u3⁢(λ) are simple), the Lagrange interpolation series

	
λ⁢uj⁢(λ)⁢∑-∞
k≠0∞Xk(j)d⁢λ⁢uj⁢(λ)d⁢λ|λ=νk(j)⁢(λ-νk(j)),j=1,2
	

and

	
u3⁢(λ)⁢∑-∞
k≠0∞Xk(3)d⁢u3⁢(λ)d⁢λ|λ=νk(3)⁢(λ-νk(3))
	

constructed on the basis of the sequences {Xk(j)}-∞,k≠0∞, define functions εj⁢(λ)∈La, j=1,2,3, respectively(see [14, Theorem A]). Using these functions, we define the even entire functions

	
vj⁢(λ)=cos⁡λ⁢a+Bj⁢sin⁡λ⁢aλ+εj⁢(λ)λ,j=1,2,
v3⁢(λ)=-λ⁢sin⁡λ⁢a+B3⁢cos⁡λ⁢a+ε3⁢(λ).
	

167

I. Dehghani Tazehkand and A. Jodayree Akbarfam - Determination of Sturm- … It follows directly from (71) and (72) that εj⁢(νk(j))=Xk(j) for j=1,2,3 and hence

	vj⁢(νk(j))	=ϕ1⁢(νk(j))⁢ϕ2⁢(νk(j))ui⁢(νk(j))⁢u3⁢(νk(j)),i,j=1,2,i≠j,	
	v3⁢(νk(3))	=ϕ1⁢(νk(3))⁢ϕ2⁢(νk(3))u1⁢(νk(3))⁢u2⁢(νk(3)).	

Let us denote by {μk(j)}-∞,k≠0∞ the set of zeros of the functions vj⁢(λ),j=1,2,3, respectively. These sets are symmetric with respect to the real axis and to the imaginary axis. Hence, we number the zeros in the proper way: μ-k(j)=-μk(j), Re⁡μk(j)≤Re⁡μk+1(j) for all k∈ℕ and the multiplicity are taken into account(we shall prove that all μk(j)⁢2 are real and all μk(j) are simple except for μ1(j), if μ1(j)=μ-1(j)=0 ). It follows from (73) and (74) that

	μk(j)	=π⁢(k-12)a+Bjπ⁢(k-12)+θk(j)k,j=1,2,	
	μk(3)	=(k-1)⁢πa+B3k⁢π+θk(3)k,	

where {θk(j)}-∞,k≠0∞∈l2 for j=1,2,3. Proposition 4.3. The following inequalities are valid:

	
μ1(j)⁢2<ν1(j)⁢2<μ2(j)⁢2<ν2(j)⁢2<⋯,j=1,2,3.
	

Proof. In the same way as proof of [22, Proposition 2.3], we can show that

	
(-1)k⁢ϕ1⁢(νk(j))⁢ϕ2⁢(νk(j))ui⁢(νk(j))⁢u3⁢(νk(j))>0,i,j=1,2,i≠j,
(-1)k⁢ϕ1⁢(νk(3))⁢ϕ2⁢(νk(3))u1⁢(νk(3))⁢u2⁢(νk(3))>0.
	

From these inequalities and (75) and (76), it follows that

	
(-1)k⁢vj⁢(νk(j))>0,j=1,2,3.
	

Let j∈{1,2,3} be fixed. It follows from (80) that between consecutive νk(j),s there is an odd number(with account of multiplicities) of μk(j) ’s. Suppose that there are 168

I. Dehghani Tazehkand and A. Jodayree Akbarfam - Determination of Sturm- … three or more of them between νk(j) and νk+1(j). Then comparing (77) and (78) with (44) and (45), we conclude that there are no μp(j) ’s between some νk′(j) and νk′+1(j) where k≠k′, a contradiction. Thus, ν1(j)⁢2<μ2(j)⁢2<ν2(j)⁢2<⋯. If vj⁢(0)>0, then 0<μ1(j)<ν1(j). If vj⁢(0)=0, then μ1(j)=0. If vj⁢(0)<0, then μ1(j) is a pure imaginary number and hence μ1(j)⁢2<ν1(j)⁢2. Proposition 4.3 is proved.

Let j∈{1,2}. It follows from (79) and the asymptotic relations (44) and (77) that the sequences {νk(j)}-∞,k≠0∞ and {μk(j)}-∞,k≠0∞ satisfy the conditions of [16, Theorem 3.4.1]. Thus, there exists a unique real-valued function qj⁢(x)∈L2⁢(0,a) such that {νk(j)}-∞,k≠0∞ and {μk(j)}-∞,k≠0∞ are the spectra of the boundary-value problems Lj and Lj′, respectively. An algorithm for the reconstruction of this potential qj⁢(x) is as follows(see [16, Section 3.4]): Without loss of generality, let us assume that μ1(j)⁢2>0, otherwise we apply a shift. The function

	
ej⁢(λ)=ei⁢λ⁢a⁢(vj⁢(λ)-i⁢λ⁢uj⁢(λ))
	

is the so-called Jost function of the corresponding prolonged Sturm-Liouville problem on the semi-axis:

	
-yj′′⁢(x)+q~j⁢(x)⁢yj⁢(x)=λ2⁢yj⁢(x),x∈[0,∞),yj⁢(0)=0,
	

where

	
q~j⁢(x)={qj⁢(x)	 if 	x∈[0,a]
0	 if 	x∈(a,∞).
	

Then we construct the S-function of the problem on the semi-axis:

	
Sj⁢(λ)=ej⁢(-λ)ej⁢(λ)
	

and the function

	
Fj⁢(x)=12⁢π⁢∫-∞∞(1-Sj⁢(λ))⁢ei⁢λ⁢x⁢𝑑λ.
	

Solving the Marchenko integral equation

	
Kj⁢(x,t)+Fj⁢(x+t)+∫x∞Kj⁢(x,s)⁢Fj⁢(x+s)⁢𝑑s=0,t>x
	

we find the unique solution Kj⁢(x,t) and

	
qj⁢(x)=-2⁢d⁢Kj⁢(x,x)d⁢x,x∈[0,a].

I. Dehghani Tazehkand and A. Jodayree Akbarfam - Determination of Sturm- … The two sequences {νk(3)}-∞,k≠0∞ and {μk(3)}-∞,k≠0∞satisfy( due to (45),(78) and (79)) the conditions of [7, Theorem 1.5.4]. Thus, there exists a unique real-valued function q3⁢(x)∈L2⁢(0,a) and a unique real number h such that {νk(3)}-∞,k≠0∞ and {μk(3)}-∞,k≠0∞ are the spectra of the boundary-value problems L3 and L3′, respectively. Below we give the algorithm of recovering of q3⁢(x) as it is described in [7, Section 1.5]. Calculate the so-called weight numbers {αk}1∞ of the problem L3′ by

	
αk=12⁢μk(3)⁢v˙3⁢(μk(3))⁢u3⁢(μk(3)),
	

where v˙3⁢(λ)=dd⁢λ⁢v3⁢(λ). If μ1(3)=0, then v˙3⁢(μ1(3))=0 and we set α1=12⁢v¨3⁢(0)⁢u3⁢(0) where v¨⁢(λ)=d2d⁢λ2⁢v3⁢(λ). Construct the function

	
F⁢(x,t)=∑k=1∞(cos⁡μk(3)⁢x⁢cos⁡μk(3)⁢tαk-cos⁡(k-1)⁢x⁢cos⁡(k-1)⁢tαk0)
	

where

	
αk0={a2,	k>1
a,	k=1.
	

Then using the unique solution of the Gel’fand-Levitan integral equation

	
K3⁢(x,t)+F⁢(x,t)+∫0xK3⁢(x,s)⁢F⁢(s,t)⁢𝑑s=0,0≤t≤x≤a,
	

we find

	
q3⁢(x)=2⁢d⁢K3⁢(x,x)d⁢x,h=K3⁢(0,0)=B3-12⁢∫0aq3⁢(x)⁢𝑑x.
	

To find β, we compare (27) and (47) and set

	
β=6⁢B0-32⁢B1-32⁢B2-3⁢B3,
	

where B0 can be determined by

	
B0=limk→∞⁡k⁢π⁢(λk(2)-k⁢π+sin-1⁡23a).
	

Now we prove that the spectrum of the problem L0 which is generated by the obtained [qj⁢(x)]j=1,2,3,h and β coincides with {λk}-∞,k≠0∞. Due to [16, Theorem 3.4.1] and [7, Theorem 1.5.4], the spectra of the problems Lj,j=1,2,3 which are generated by the obtained [qj⁢(x)]j=1,2,3 and h coincide with {νk(j)}-∞,k≠0∞,j=1,2,3, 170

I. Dehghani Tazehkand and A. Jodayree Akbarfam - Determination of Sturm-… respectively. The function uj⁢(a,λ)⁢(j=1,2,3) where uj⁢(x,λ) is the solution of (1) with obtained [qj⁢(x)]j=1,2,3 and h which satisfy the initial conditions (3), coincide with uj⁢(λ), since they have the same zeros and the same asymptotics. Also, since uj′⁢(a,λ) and vj⁢(λ)⁢(j=1,2,3) have the same asymptotics and according to [16, Theorem 3.4.1] and [7, Theorem 1.5.4] have the same zeros, hence they coincide. Thus, the values of the function Φ⁢(λ) (defined by (11)) at λ=νk(j) coincide with

	
ϕ1⁢(νk(j))⁢ϕ2⁢(νk(j))
	

for all k∈ℤ\{0} and all j=1,2,3, i.e., with the corresponding values of the function ϕ1⁢(λ)⁢ϕ2⁢(λ). This implies that the entire function

	
Δ⁢(λ):=Φ⁢(λ)-ϕ1⁢(λ)⁢ϕ2⁢(λ)
	

of exponential type 3⁢a can be represented as follows:

	
Δ⁢(λ)=t⁢(λ)⁢∏j=13uj⁢(a,λ),
	

where t⁢(λ) is an entire function. Using (16), (54) and (55) we have

	Δ⁢(λ)=t⁢(λ)⁢(sin2⁡λ⁢a⁢cos⁡λ⁢aλ2-(B1+B2)⁢cos2⁡λ⁢a⁢sin⁡λ⁢aλ3+B3⁢sin3⁡λ⁢aλ3+ω1⁢(λ)λ3)

where E1′,E2′ are constants and ω1⁢(λ),ω2⁢(λ)∈L3⁢a. Substituting (32), (85) and (86) into (83) and using (81), we obtain

	
t⁢(λ)⁢(λ⁢sin2⁡λ⁢a⁢cos⁡λ⁢a-(B1+B2)⁢cos2⁡λ⁢a⁢sin⁡λ⁢a+B3⁢sin3⁡λ⁢a+ω1⁢(λ))
=(E1-E1′)⁢sin3⁡λ⁢a+(E2-E2′)⁢cos2⁡λ⁢a⁢sin⁡λ⁢a+ω3⁢(λ),
	

where ω3⁢(λ)∈L3⁢a. Since the functions sin3⁡λ⁢a,cos2⁡λ⁢a⁢sin⁡λ⁢a,ω1⁢(λ) and ω3⁢(λ) are bounded on the real axis, hence relation (87) implies that t⁢(λ)≡0 and from (83), it follows that Φ⁢(λ)=ϕ1⁢(λ)⁢ϕ2⁢(λ). Consequently, the sequence {λk}-∞,k≠0∞ coincides with the spectrum of the boundary-value problem L0. The operator A constructed 171

Jodayree Akbarfam - Determination of Sturm-… by (4), (5) using the obtained [qj⁢(x)]j=1,2,3,h and β is strictly positive, because it is self-adjoint and its spectrum is positive. The uniqueness of the solution of the inverse problem follows from the fact that formulas (71) and (72) establishes one-toone correspondence between l2 and La (see [14, Theorem A]). The proof of Theorem 3.1 is finished.

Remark 4.4. If condition 1 (ii) of Theorem 4.1 fails, i.e., the sets {νk(j)}-∞,k≠0∞, j=1,2,3 are not pairwise disjoint(consequently, the condition 3 fails too), either the uniqueness or the existence result of mentioned theorem can also fails, for the same reasons as in the case of three spectra(see [9,21]). If the sequences {λk}-∞,k≠0∞ and {κk}-∞∞=⋃j=13{νk(j)}-∞,k≠0∞⁢⋃{0} are not pairwise disjoint and satisfy the statements of Theorem 4.1, then the solution of the inverse problem exists but is not unique.","2. Direct Problem In this section, we describe the properties of sequences of eigenvalues of the boundary-value problems L0 and Lj,j=1,2,3 that are necessary for what follows.

Let us denote by cj⁢(x,λ),sj⁢(x,λ),j=1,2,3 the solutions of (1.1) on the edge ej which satisfy the initial conditions

	
cj′⁢(0,λ)=cj⁢(0,λ)-1=0,sj⁢(0,λ)=sj′⁢(0,l)-1=0.
	

For each fixed x∈[0,a], the functions cj(v)⁢(x,λ) and sj(v)⁢(x,λ),v=0,1,j=1,2,3 are entire in 1. Since {cj⁢(x,λ),sj⁢(x,λ)} is a fundamental system of solutions of (1.1) on the edge ej, then the solutions of (1.1), which satisfy the conditions (1.3), are

	
yj⁢(x,λ)=Cj⁢uj⁢(x,λ),j=1,2,3,
	




ISRN Applied Mathematics 5 where Cj,j=1,2,3 are constants and

	
uj⁢(x,λ)={sj⁢(x,λ),	j=1,2,
c3⁢(x,λ)+h⁢s3⁢(x,λ),	j=3.
	

Substituting (2.2) into (1.2), we establish that the eigenvalues of the boundary-value problem L0 are zeros of the entire function

	
Φ⁢(λ):=|u1⁢(a,λ)	-u2⁢(a,λ)	0
u1⁢(a,λ)	0	-u3⁢(a,λ)
u1′⁢(a,λ)+β⁢u1⁢(a,λ)	u2′⁢(a,λ)	u3′⁢(a,λ)|
	

or

	
Φ⁢(λ)=∑i=13(ui′⁢(a,λ)⁢∏j=1
j≠i3uj⁢(a,λ))+β⁢∏j=13uj⁢(a,λ)
	

For what follows, we need the definition presented below. Definition 2.1 (see [21]). Let {zk}-∞∞⁢({zk}-∞,k≠0∞) be a sequence of complex numbers of finite multiplicities which satisfy the following conditions: (1) the sequence is symmetric with respect to the imaginary axis and symmetrically located numbers possess the same multiplicities; (2) any strip |Re⁡z|≤p<∞ contains not more than a finite number of zk. Then, the following way of enumeration is called proper: (i) z-k=-zk¯⁢(Re⁡zk≠0); (ii) Re⁡zk≤Re⁡zk+1; (iii) the multiplicities are taken into account. If a sequence has even number of pure imaginary elements, we exclude the index zero from enumeration to make it proper. Throughout Section 2, denote

	
Bj={12⁢∫0aqj⁢(x)⁢𝑑x,	j=1,2,
h+12⁢∫0aq3⁢(x)⁢𝑑x,	j=3.
	

We introduce the entire function

	
Ψ⁢(λ)=∏j=13uj⁢(a,λ)
	




6 ISRN Applied Mathematics Let us denote by {λk}-∞,k≠0∞ the set of zeros of Φ⁢(λ) and by {κk}-∞,k≠0∞ the set of zeros of the function Ψ⁢(λ). Denote by {vk(j)}-∞,k≠0∞⁢j=1,2,3 the sets of zeros of the functions uj⁢(a,λ),j=1,2,3, respectively. It is clear from (2.7) that the set {κk}-∞,k≠0∞ is the union of the sets ⋃j=13{vk(j)}-∞,k≠0∞, that is, the spectra of the auxiliary problems Lj,j=1,2,3. According to the remark presented in Section 1, all numbers λk,vk(j),j=1,2,3 and κk are real and nonzero. We enumerate the sets {λk}-∞,k≠0∞,{vk(j)}-∞,k≠0∞⁢j=1,2,3 and {κk}-∞,k≠0∞ in the proper way (λ-k=-λk,λk≤λk+1,v-k(j)=-vk(j),vk(j)<vk+1(j) for j=1,2,3 and κ-k=-κk,κk≤κk+1). Note that the sets of eigenvalues {vk(j)}-∞,k≠0∞,j=1,2,3 behave asymptotically as follows (see [20, Section 1.5]):

	
vk(j)=k⁢πa+Bjπ⁢k+δk(j)k,j=1,2,
vk(3)=π⁢(k-(1/2))a+B3π⁢(k-(1/2))+δk(3)k
	

where {δk(j)}-∞⁢k≠0∞∈l2 for j=1,2,3. Let us denote by Ld,d>0 the class (introduced in [22, page 149]) of entire functions of exponential type ≤d whose restrictions on the real line belong to L2⁢(-∞,∞). Lemma 2.2. The functions Φ⁢(λ) and Ψ⁢(λ) can be represented as follows:

	Φ⁢(λ)=	2⁢sin⁡λ⁢a-3⁢sin3⁡λ⁢aλ+(2⁢B1+2⁢B2+3⁢B3+β)⁢sin2⁡λ⁢a⁢cos⁡λ⁢aλ2	
		-(B1+B2)⁢cos3⁡λ⁢aλ2+ω1⁢(λ)λ2,	
	Ψ⁢(λ)=	sin2⁡λ⁢a⁢cos⁡λ⁢aλ2-(B1+B2)⁢cos2⁡λ⁢a⁢sin⁡λ⁢aλ3+B3⁢sin3⁡λ⁢aλ3+ω2⁢(λ)λ3	

where ω1⁢(λ),ω2⁢(λ)∈L3⁢a. Proof. Using the formulas of [19, page 18], [20, page 9] and taking into account that

	
∫0af⁢(t)⁢cos⁡λ⁢t⁢d⁢t∈La,∫0af⁢(t)⁢sin⁡λ⁢t⁢d⁢t∈La,
	

whenever f∈L2⁢(0,a) by the Paley-Wiener theorem [23, page 103], we obtain

	
uj⁢(a,λ)=sin⁡λ⁢aλ+ρj⁢1⁢(λ)λ=sin⁡λ⁢aλ-Bj⁢cos⁡λ⁢aλ2+ρj⁢2⁢(λ)λ2,j=1,2
u3⁢(a,λ)=cos⁡λ⁢a+ρ31⁢(λ)=cos⁡λ⁢a+B3⁢sin⁡λ⁢aλ+ρ32⁢(λ)λ
	




ISRN Applied Mathematics

	
uj′⁢(a,λ)=cos⁡λ⁢a+Bj⁢sin⁡λ⁢aλ+σj⁢(λ)λ,j=1,2,
u3′⁢(a,λ)=-λ⁢sin⁡λ⁢a+B3⁢cos⁡λ⁢a+σ3⁢(λ)
	

where ρj⁢1⁢(λ),ρj⁢2⁢(λ),σj⁢(λ),j=1,2,3, are entire functions of class La. Substituting (2.12) into (2.5) and (2.7), we get (2.9) and (2.10).

Theorem 2.3. The set {λk}-∞,k≠0∞ of zeros of Φ⁢(λ) can be represented as the union of three pairwise disjoint subsequences ⋃j=13{λk(j)}-∞,k≠0∞ which, being enumerated in the following way: λ-k(1)=-λk(1), λ-k(2)=-λk(3),λ-k(3)=-λk(2), and λk(j)≤λk+1(j) for j=1,2,3, behave asymptotically as follows:

	
λk(1)=k⁢πa+B1+B22⁢k⁢π+rk(1)k,
λk(j)=k⁢π+(-1)j⁢sin-1⁡2/3a+3⁢B1+3⁢B2+6⁢B3+2⁢β12⁢k⁢π+γk(j)k,j=2,3,
 where ⁢{γk(j)}-∞,k≠0∞∈l2⁢ for ⁢j=1,2,3.
	

Proof. In the same way as [16, Lemma 1.3], we can show that the set of zeros {λk}-∞,k≠0∞ can be arranged into three pairwise disjoint subsequences {λk(j)}-∞,k≠0,∞⁢j=1,2,3 enumerated in the following way: λ-k(1)=-λk(1),λ-k(2)=-λk(3),λ-k(3)=-λk(2), and λk(j)≤λk+1(j) for j=1,2,3, such that {λk}-∞,k≠0∞=⋃j=13{λk(j)}-∞,k≠0∞, and

	
λk(1)=k⁢πa+εk(1),
λk(j)=k⁢π+(-1)j⁢sin-1⁡2/3a+εk(j),j=2,3,
	

where εk(j)=o⁢(1), as k→∞ for j=1,2,3. It is not difficult to see that

	
εk(j)=O⁢(1k),k⟶∞,j=1,2,3.
	

Substituting (2.15) into λk(1)⁢Φ⁢(λk(1))=0, then from (2.9) and taking into account that the function ω1⁢(λ) is bounded on the real axis by the Paley-Wiener theorem, we obtain

	λk(1)⁢Φ⁢(λk(1))=	(-1)k⁢(2⁢sin⁡εk(1)⁢a-3⁢sin3⁡εk(1)⁢a)	
		+(-1)k⁢a⁢(2⁢B1+2⁢B2+3⁢B3+β)⁢sin2⁡εk(1)⁢a⁢cos⁡εk(1)⁢ak⁢π

		-(-1)k⁢a⁢(B1+B2)⁢cos3⁡εk(1)⁢ak⁢π+a⁢ω1⁢(λk(1))k⁢π+O⁢(1k2)	
	=	(-1)k⁢2⁢sin⁡εk(1)⁢a+O⁢(1k)=0,k→∞.	

This yields sin⁡εk(1)⁢a=O⁢(1/k). Thus, εk(1)=O⁢(1/k). Similarly, we can show that εk(j)=O⁢(1/k) for j=2,3. Substituting (2.15) into the equation λk(1)⁢Φ⁢(λk(1))=0, where Φ⁢(λ) is given by (2.9), by expanding the left-hand side of resulting equation in power series and taking into account (2.17) and {ω1⁢(λk(1))}-∞,k≠0∞∈l2 (see [20, Lemma 1.4.3]), we obtain

	
2⁢εk(1)⁢a-a⁢(B1+B2)k⁢π+τkk=0,
	

where {τk}-∞,k≠0∞∈l2. Solving this equation we get (2.13). In the same way, we get (2.14). To compare necessary conditions on a sequence to be the spectrum of the boundaryvalue problem L0 with the sufficient condition which will be obtained in Section 3, we need more precise asymptotics.

Theorem 2.4. Let qj⁢(x)∈W21⁢(0,a) for j=1,2,3. Then the subsequences of Theorem 2.3 behave asymptotically as follows:

	
λk(1)=k⁢πa+B1+B22⁢k⁢π+rk(1)k2,
lk(j)=k⁢π+(-1)j⁢sin-1⁡2/3a+3⁢B1+3⁢B2+6⁢B3+2⁢β12⁢k⁢π+rk(j)k2,j=2,3,
	

where {γk(j)}-∞,k≠0∞∈l2 for j=1,2,3. Proof. If qj⁢(x)∈W21⁢(0,a), twice integrating by parts the formulas of [20, page 9 ] and [19, page 18], we obtain

	
uj⁢(a,λ)=sin⁡λ⁢aλ-Bj⁢cos⁡λ⁢aλ2+Dj⁢sin⁡λ⁢aλ3+ρj⁢(λ)λ3,j=1,2
u3⁢(a,λ)=cos⁡λ⁢a+B3⁢sin⁡λ⁢aλ+D3⁢cos⁡λ⁢aλ2+ρ3⁢(λ)λ2

ISRN Applied Mathematics 9 where Dj,Dj′,j=1,2,3 are constants and ρj⁢(λ),σj⁢(λ),j=1,2,3 are entire functions of class La. Substituting (2.22) into (2.5), we obtain

	Φ⁢(λ)=	2⁢sin⁡λ⁢a-3⁢sin3⁡λ⁢aλ+(2⁢B1+2⁢B2+3⁢B3+β)⁢sin2⁡λ⁢a⁢cos⁡λ⁢aλ2	
		-(B1+B2)⁢cos3⁡λ⁢aλ2+E1⁢sin3⁡λ⁢aλ3+E2⁢cos2⁡λ⁢a⁢sin⁡λ⁢aλ3+ω3⁢(λ)λ3	

where E1,E2 are constants and ω3⁢(λ)∈L3⁢a. Substituting (2.13) into the equation λk(1)⁢Φ⁢(λk(1))= 0 , where Φ⁢(λ) is given by (2.23) and by expanding the left-hand side of resulting equation in power series, we get (2.20). Analogously, we obtain (2.21). Theorem 2.4 is proved.

Remark 2.5. Under the conditions of Theorem 2.4, the spectra {vk(j)}-∞,k≠0∞ of the boundaryvalue problems Lj for j=1,2,3 behave asymptotically as follows (see [20, page 75]):

	
vk(j)=k⁢πa+Bjπ⁢k+δk(j)k2,j=1,2,
vk(3)=π⁢(k-(1/2))a+B3π⁢(k-(1/2))+δk(3)k2,
	

where {δk(j)}-∞,k≠0∞∈l2 for j=1,2,3 For investigation of direct and inverse spectral problems, methods of the theory of entire and meromorphic functions are widely used. For this reason, we give several notation and definitions for what follows.

If Ω⊆ℂ is an open set, we denote by ℋ⁢(Ω) the set of all functions which are analytic in Ω and by ℳ⁢(Ω) the set of all functions meromorphic in Ω. Definition 2.6 (see [24]). Let 𝒦⊆ℳ⁢(ℂ) and let φ,ψ∈ℋ⁢(ℂ). (i) The pair (φ,ψ) is called a 1- 𝒦-pair, if ψ-1⁢φ∈𝒦 and φ and ψ have no common zeros. (ii) Let n∈ℕ and n≥2. The pair (φ,ψ) is called an n - 𝒦-pair, if ψ-1⁢φ∈𝒦, and there exist 1- 𝒦-pairs (φ1,ψ1),…,(φn,ψn) such that

	
ψ=∏i=1nψi,φ=∑i=1n(φi⁢∏j=1
j≠inψj)
	

and no representation of this kind is possible with less than n many 1- 𝒦-pairs. Definition 2.7 (see [24]). A function f∈ℋ(ℂ\ℝ ) is said to be of Nevanlinna class 𝒩 if (i) f⁢(z)=f⁢(z¯)¯ for z∈ℂ\ℝ; (ii) Im⁡f⁢(z)≥0 for Im⁡z>0.

10 ISRN Applied Mathematics Definition 2.8 (see [24]). The class 𝒩ep of essentially positive Nenalinna functions is defined as the set of all functions f∈𝒩 which are analytic in ℂ\[0,∞) with possible exception of finitely many poles. Moreover, the class 𝒩-ep is defined as the set of all functions f∈𝒩 such that for some b∈ℝ we have f∈ℋ⁢(ℂ\[b,∞)) and f⁢(z)≤0 for z∈(-∞,b). It is easy to check that 𝒩-ep⊆𝒩ep. Definition 2.9 (see [25]). An entire function ω⁢(z) of exponential type σ>0 is said to be a function of sine-type if it satisfies the following conditions: (i) all the zeros of ω⁢(z) lie in a strip |Im⁡z|<h<∞;

	
0<m≤|ω⁢(z)|≤M<∞;
	

(iii) the type of ω⁢(z) in the lower half-plane coincides with that in the upper half-plane. Let us introduce the entire functions

	
φj⁢(z)=-uj′⁢(a,z)-β3⁢uj⁢(a,z),j=1,2,3,
ψj⁢(z)=uj⁢(a,z),j=1,2,3,
φ⁢(z)=-Φ⁢(z),ψ⁢(z)=Ψ⁢(z).
	

Using (2.5) and (2.7), we obtain

	
φ⁢(z)=∑i=13(φi⁢(z)⁢∏j=1
j≠i3ψj⁢(z)),ψ⁢(z)=∏j=13ψj⁢(z)
	

and consequently

	
φ⁢(z)ψ⁢(z)=∑j=13φj⁢(z)ψj⁢(z).
	

Lemma 2.10. (1) the zeros of the functions φj⁢(z) and ψj⁢(z)⁢(j=1,2,3) are real; (2) the functions φj⁢(z) and ψj⁢(z)⁢(j=1,2,3) have no common zeros. Proof. The zeros of φj⁢(z),j=1,2,3 coincide with the squares of the eigenvalues of the boundary-value problems

	
-yj′′⁢(x)+qj⁢(x)⁢yj⁢(x)=λ2⁢yj⁢(x),	x∈[0,a],
yj⁢(0)=yj′⁢(a)+β3⁢yj⁢(a)=0,	j=1,2,
	




ISRN Applied Mathematics 11

	
-y3′′⁢(x)+q3⁢(x)⁢y3⁢(x)=λ2⁢y3⁢(x),x∈[0,a],
y3′⁢(0)-h⁢y3⁢(0)=y3′⁢(a)+β3⁢y3⁢(a)=0,
	

respectively, and the zeros of ψj⁢(z) coincide with the squares of the eigenvalues of the boundary-value problems Lj,j=1,2,3, respectively. These problems are self-adjoint and it follows from [26, Part I, Theorem 3] that the squares of their eigenvalues are real. Assertion 1 is proved. To prove assertion 2, let z0 be a common zero of φj⁢(z) and ψj⁢(z). Using the Lagrange identity(see [26, Part II, page 50]) for solutions uj⁢(a,z) and uj⁢(a,z0) of (1.1), we obtain

	(z-z0)⁢∫0auj⁢(x,z)⁢uj⁢(x,z0)⁢𝑑x	=(uj⁢(x,z)⁢uj′⁢(x,z0)-uj′⁢(x,z)⁢uj⁢(x,z0))|0a	
		=φj⁢(z)⁢ψj⁢(z0)-φj⁢(z0)⁢ψj⁢(z).	

For z→z0 we get

	
∫0auj2⁢(x,z0)⁢𝑑x=φ˙j⁢(z0)⁢ψj⁢(z0)-φj⁢(z0)⁢ψ˙j⁢(z0)=0,
	

where φ˙j⁢(z)=(d/d⁢z)⁢φj⁢(z) and ψ˙j⁢(z)=(d/d⁢z)⁢ψj⁢(z). This implies that uj⁢(x,z0)≡0 which is a contradiction. Therefore, φj⁢(z) and ψj⁢(z) have no common zeros.

Proof. Let j∈{1,2,3}. Using the Lagrange identity for the solution uj⁢(a,z) of (1.1), we have

	
(uj′⁢(x,z)¯⁢uj⁢(x,z)-uj′⁢(x,z)⁢uj⁢(x,z)¯)|0a=2⁢i⁢Im⁡z⁢∫0a|uj⁢(x,z)|2⁢𝑑x.
	

Since

	
Im⁡(uj′⁢(a,z)¯⁢uj⁢(a,z)-uj′⁢(a,z)⁢uj⁢(a,z)¯)=-2⁢|uj⁢(a,z)|2⁢Im⁡uj′⁢(a,z)uj⁢(a,z),
	

then (2.35) yields

	
-Im⁡uj′⁢(a,z)uj⁢(a,z)=Im⁡z⁢∫0a|uj⁢(x,z)|2⁢𝑑x|uj⁢(a,z)|2,Im⁡z≠0.
	

Thus,

	
Im⁡(-uj′⁢(a,z)uj⁢(a,z))≥0  for ⁢Im⁡z>0
	




12 ISRN Applied Mathematics and consequently

	
Im⁡φj⁢(z)ψj⁢(z)=Im⁡(-uj′⁢(a,z)uj⁢(a,z)-β3)≥0  for ⁢Im⁡z>0.
	

Also, according to Lemma 2.10 the zeros of φj⁢(z) and ψj⁢(z) are real and hence φj⁢(z)/ψj⁢(z)∈ ℋ⁢(ℂ\ℝ). Therefore, φj⁢(z)/ψj⁢(z)∈𝒩. Now it follows from (2.31) and (2.39) that φ⁢(z)/ψ⁢(z)∈ ℋ⁢(ℂ\ℝ) and

	
Im⁡φ⁢(z)ψ⁢(z)=∑j=13Im⁡φj⁢(z)ψj⁢(z)≥0  for ⁢Im⁡z>0
	

Consequently φ⁢(z)/ψ⁢(z)∈𝒩. Lemma 2.11 is proved. Lemma 2.12. The functions φj⁢(z)/ψj⁢(z),j=1,2,3 and φ⁢(z)/ψ⁢(z) are of the class 𝒩-e⁢p. Proof. By virtue of the formulas (2.12) we get

	
uj⁢(a,z)=e|z|⁢a2⁢|z|⁢(1+o⁢(1)),z⟶-∞,j=1,2,
u3⁢(a,z)=e|z|⁢a2⁢(1+o⁢(1)),z⟶-∞,
uj′⁢(a,z)=e|z|⁢a2⁢(1+o⁢(1)),z⟶-∞,j=1,2,
u3′⁢(a,z)=|z|⁢e|z|2⁢(1+o⁢(1)),z⟶-∞.
	

Using these asymptotics we obtain from (2.27) and (2.28)

	
φj⁢(z)ψj⁢(z)=-|z|⁢(1+o⁢(1)),z⟶-∞,j=1,2,3,
	

and consequently

	
limz→-∞⁡φj⁢(z)ψj⁢(z)=-∞,j=1,2,3.
	

It follows form Lemmas 2.10 and 2.11, and (2.43) that there exist real numbers bj∈ℝ,j= 1,2,3 such that

	
φj⁢(z)ψj⁢(z)∈𝒩∩H⁢(ℂ\[bj,∞)),φj⁢(z)ψj⁢(z)<0  for ⁢z∈(-∞,bj)
	

Therefore, φj⁢(z)/ψj⁢(z)∈𝒩-ep for j=1,2,3.

ISRN Applied Mathematics 13 Now using (2.31) and (2.44) and Lemma 2.11, we conclude that

	
φ⁢(z)ψ⁢(z)∈𝒩∩ℋ⁢(ℂ\[b,∞)),φ⁢(z)ψ⁢(z)=∑j=13φj⁢(z)ψj⁢(z)<0  for ⁢z∈(-∞,b),
	

where b=min⁡{b1,b2,b3}. Thus, φ⁢(z)/ψ⁢(z)∈𝒩-ep. Lemma 2.12 is proved. Theorem 2.13. The sequences {λk}-∞,k≠0∞ and {κk}-∞,k≠0∞ satisfy the following conditions: (1) 0<λ1<κ1≤λ2≤κ2≤⋯≤λk≤κk≤⋯⁢(λ-k=-λk,κ-k=-κk); (2) κk=λk+1 if and only if λk+1=κk+1 for k∈ℕ; (3) the maximal multiplicity of κk is 3. Proof. Denote 𝒩-ep:=ℳ⁢(ℂ)∩𝒩-ep. The functions uj⁢(a,z) and uj′⁢(a,z) are entire in z and hence in view of Lemma 2.12, φj⁢(z)/ψj⁢(z)∈κ-ep  for j=1,2,3 and φ⁢(z)/ψ⁢(z)∈𝒩-ep . Also, by Lemma 2.10 the functions φj⁢(z),ψj⁢(z) have no common zeros. Therefore, the pairs (φj,ψj),j=1,2,3 are 1- 𝒩-ep-pairs and consequently, in view of (2.30), the pair (φ,ψ) is an m - 𝒩-ep-pair with some m≤3 (see Definition 2.6). On the other hand by virtue of (2.29), the squares of the zeros of Φ⁢(λ) and Ψ⁢(λ) coincide with the zeros of φ⁢(z) and ψ⁢(z), respectively. Now the assertions of Theorem 2.13 immediately follows from [24, Corollary 4.6]. 3. Inverse Problem In the present section, we study the problem of reconstruction of the potential q⁢(x)= [qj⁢(x)]j=1,2,3 and the real numbers h,β from the given spectral characteristics. Let us denote by Q the class of sets {[qj⁢(x)]j=1,2,3,h,β} which satisfy the following conditions: (i) qj⁢(x),j=1,2,3 are real-valued functions from L2⁢(0,a); (ii) h,β∈ℝ; (iii) the operator A constructed via (1.6) is strictly positive. Theorem 3.1. Let the following conditions be satisfied. (1) Three sequences {vk(j)}-∞,k≠0∞⁢j=1,2,3 of real numbers are such that (i) v-k(j)=-vk(j),vk(j)<vk+1(j),vk(j)≠0 for all k∈ℕ and j=1,2,3; (ii) {vk(i)}-∞,k≠0∞∩{vk(j)}-∞,k≠0∞=∅ for i≠j,i,j=1,2,3; (iii) one has

vk(3)=π⁢(k-(1/2))a+B3π⁢(k-(1/2))+δk(3)k2
	

where Bj are real constants, Bi≠Bj for i≠j and {δk(j)}-∞,k≠0∞∈l2 for j=1,2,3. (2) A sequence {λk}-∞,k≠0∞ of real numbers (λ-k=-λk,λk≤λk+1,λk≠0 for all k∈ℕ) can be represented as the union of three pairwise disjoint subsequences {λk}-∞,k≠0∞= ⋃j=13{λk(j)}-∞,k≠0∞(λ-k(1)=-λk(1),λ-k(2)=-λk(3),λ-k(3)=-λk(2) and λk(j)≤λk+1(j) for j=1,2,3) which behave asymptotically as follows:

where B0 is a real constant and {γk(j)}-∞,k≠0∞∈l2 for j=1,2,3. (3) The sequences {λk}-∞,k≠0∞ and {κk}-∞∞:=⋃j=13{vk(j)}-∞,k≠0∞⁢⋃{0} (κ-k=-κk,κk<κk+1) interlace in the following strict sense:

	
⋯<κ-2<λ-2<κ-1<λ-1<κ0=0<λ1<κ1<λ2<κ2<⋯.
	

Then there exists a unique set {[qj⁢(x)]j=1,2,3,h,β}∈Q such that the sequence {λk}-∞,k≠0∞ coincide with the spectrum of the boundary-value problem L0, where β=6⁢B0-(3/2)⁢B1-(3/2)⁢B2-3⁢B3, h=B3-(1/2)⁢∫0aq3⁢(x)⁢𝑑x and the sequences {vk(j)}-∞,k≠0′∞⁢j=1,2,3 coincides with the spectra of the boundary-value problems Lj,j=1,2,3, respectively. Proof. Denote by

	
{ρk(0)}-∞,k≠0∞:={π⁢k-ξa}-∞,k≠0∞⁢⋃{π⁢k+ξa}-∞,k≠0∞,ξ:=sin-1⁡23,
{ρk}-∞,k≠0∞:={λk(2)}-∞,k≠0∞⁢⋃{λk(3)}-∞,k≠0∞
	

It is possible to enumerate {ρk(0)}-∞,k≠0∞ and {ρk}-∞,k≠0∞ in the proper way (ρ-k(0)=-ρk(0),ρk(0)< ρk+1(0) and ρ-k=-ρk,ρk≤ρk+1). Let us construct the following entire functions:

	
uj⁢(λ)=a⁢∏1∞(a2π2⁢k2⁢(vk(j)⁢2-λ2)),j=1,2
u3⁢(λ)=∏1∞(a2π2⁢(k-(1/2))2⁢(vk(3)⁢2-λ2))
	




ISRN Applied Mathematics 15

	
ϕ1⁢(λ)=a⁢∏1∞(a2π2⁢k2⁢(λk(1)⁢2-λ2)),
ϕ2⁢(λ)=2⁢∏1∞(1ρk(0)⁢2⁢(ρk2-λ2)).
	

(3.7) Using [27, Lemma 2.1], we obtain

	
uj⁢(λ)=sin⁡λ⁢aλ-Bj⁢cos⁡λ⁢aλ2+Fj⁢sin⁡λ⁢aλ3+fj⁢(λ)λ3,j=1,2
	

where Fj,j=1,2 are constants and fj⁢(λ)∈La for j=1,2. In the same way as [27, Lemma 2.1] we can prove that

	
u3⁢(λ)=cos⁡λ⁢a+B3⁢sin⁡λ⁢aλ+F3⁢cos⁡λ⁢aλ2+f3⁢(λ)λ2,
ϕ1⁢(λ)=sin⁡λ⁢aλ-(B1+B22)⁢cos⁡λ⁢aλ2+G1⁢sin⁡λ⁢aλ3+g1⁢(λ)λ3,
ϕ2⁢(λ)=2-3⁢sin2⁡λ⁢a+3⁢B0⁢sin⁡2⁢λ⁢aλ+G2⁢2-3⁢sin2⁡λ⁢aλ2+g2⁢(λ)λ2,
	

where F3,Gj,j=1,2 are constants and f3⁢(λ),g1⁢(λ)∈La and g2⁢(λ)∈L2⁢a. Let us set

	
Xk(j):=vk(j)⁢(ϕ1⁢(vk(j))⁢ϕ2⁢(vk(j))ui⁢(vk(j))⁢u3⁢(vk(j))-cos⁡vk(j)⁢a-Bj⁢sin⁡vk(j)vk(j)),i,j=1,2,i≠j,
Xk(3):=(ϕ1⁢(vk(3))⁢ϕ2⁢(vk(3))u1⁢(vk(3))⁢u2⁢(vk(3))+vk(3)⁢sin⁡vk(3)⁢a-B3⁢cos⁡vk(3)⁢a)
	

where the numbers Bj,j=1,2,3 can be determined by

	
Bj=limk→∞⁡k⁢π⁢(vk(j)-π⁢ka),j=1,2,
B3=limk→∞⁡π⁢(k-12)⁢(vk(3)-π⁢(k-(1/2))a).
	

It is clear that X-k(j)=-Xk(j) for j=1,2 and X-k(3)=Xk(3). To complete the proof we need the following lemma.

16 ISRN Applied Mathematics Lemma 3.2. One has

	
{Xk(j)}-∞,k≠0∞∈l2⁢ for ⁢j=1,2,3⁢. 
	

Proof. Substituting (3.1) into (3.8) and (3.9), we obtain

	
u2⁢(vk(1))=(-1)k⁢a2⁢(B1-B2)π2⁢k2+ζk(1)k3
u3⁢(vk(1))=(-1)k⁢(1-a2⁢B122⁢π2⁢k2+a2⁢B1⁢B3π2⁢k2+a2⁢F3π2⁢k2)+ζk(2)k2
ϕ1⁢(vk(1))=(-1)k⁢a2⁢(B1-B2)π2⁢k2+ζk(3)k3
ϕ2⁢(vk(1))=2+ζk(4)k
	

where {ζk(j)}-∞,k≠0∞∈l2 for j=1,4¯. Also, using (3.1), we obtain the asymptotic relation

	
cos⁡vk(1)⁢a+B1⁢sin⁡vk(1)vk(1)=(-1)k⁢(1+ηkk),
	

where {ηk}-∞,k≠0∞∈l2. If we substitute (3.14) and (3.15) into (3.10), then we conclude that {Xk(1)}-∞,k≠0∞∈l2. Analogously we can show that {Xk(2)}-∞,k≠0∞∈l2. We show that {Xk(3)}-∞,k≠0∞∈l2. Let us substitute (3.2) into (3.8) and (3.9). We obtain

	
uj⁢(vk(3))=(-1)k+1vk(3)⁢(1+ζk′⁣(j)k),j=1,2
ϕ1⁢(vk(3))=(-1)k+1vk(3)⁢(1+ζk′⁣(3)k)
ϕ2⁢(vk(3))=-1+ζk(4)k
	

where {ζk′⁣(j)}-∞,k≠0∞∈l2 for j=1,4¯. Furthermore, taking into account (3.2), we have

	
vk(3)⁢sin⁡vk(3)⁢a-B3⁢cos⁡vk(3)⁢a=(-1)k+1⁢vk(3)⁢(1+ηk′k)⁢, 
	

where {ηk′}-∞,k≠0∞∈l2. Using (3.16) and (3.17) in (3.11), the assertion of Lemma 3.2 for j=3 follows.

ISRN Applied Mathematics 17 Now since the functions λ⁢uj⁢(λ),j=1,2 and u3⁢(λ) are sine-type functions (see Definition 2.9) and by virtue of (3.1), (3.2), and (3.5), infk≠p⁡|vk(j)-vp(j)|>0 for j=1,2,3 (and hence the zeros of λ⁢uj⁢(λ),j=1,2 and u3⁢(λ) are simple), the Lagrange interpolation series

	
λ⁢uj⁢(λ)⁢∑-∞
k≠0∞Xk(j)d⁢λ⁢uj⁢(λ)/d⁢λ|λ=vk(j)⁢(λ-vk(j)),j=1,2,
u3⁢(λ)⁢∑-∞
k≠0∞Xk(3)d⁢u3⁢(λ)/d⁢λ|λ=vk(3)⁢(λ-vk(3))
	

constructed on the basis of the sequences {Xk(j)}-∞,k≠0∞ define functions εj⁢(λ)∈La,j=1,2,3, respectively (see [28, Theorem A]). Using these functions, we define the even entire functions

	
vj⁢(λ)=cos⁡λ⁢a+Bj⁢sin⁡λ⁢aλ+εj⁢(λ)λ,j=1,2,
v3⁢(λ)=-λ⁢sin⁡λ⁢a+B3⁢cos⁡λ⁢a+ε3⁢(λ).
	

It follows directly from (3.18) and (3.19) that εj⁢(vk(j))=Xk(j) for j=1,2,3 and hence

	
vj⁢(vk(j))=ϕ1⁢(vk(j))⁢ϕ2⁢(vk(j))ui⁢(vk(j))⁢u3⁢(vk(j)),i,j=1,2,i≠j
v3⁢(vk(3))=ϕ1⁢(vk(3))⁢ϕ2⁢(vk(3))u1⁢(vk(3))⁢u2⁢(vk(3)).
	

Let us denote by {μk(j)}-∞,k≠0∞ the set of zeros of the functions vj⁢(λ),j=1,2,3, respectively. These sets are symmetric with respect to the real axis and to the imaginary axis. Hence, we number the zeros in the proper way: μ-k(j)=-μk(j),Re⁡μk(j)≤Re⁡μk+1(j) for all k∈ℕ and the multiplicities are taken into account (we will prove that all μk(j)⁢2 are real and all μk(j) are simple except for μ1(j), if μ1(j)=μ-1(j)=0 ). It follows from (3.20) that

	
μk(j)=π⁢(k-(1/2))a+Bjπ⁢(k-(1/2))+θk(j)k,j=1,2,
μk(3)=(k-1)⁢πa+B3k⁢π+θk(3)k,
	

where {θk(j)}-∞,k≠0∞∈l2 for j=1,2,3.

18 ISRN Applied Mathematics Proposition 3.3. The following inequalities are valid:

	
μ1(j)⁢2<v1(j)⁢2<μ2(j)⁢2<v2(j)⁢2<⋯,j=1,2,3.
	

Proof. In the same way as proof of [16, Proposition 2.3], we can show that

	
(-1)k⁢ϕ1⁢(vk(j))⁢ϕ2⁢(vk(j))ui⁢(vk(j))⁢u3⁢(vk(j))>0,i,j=1,2,i≠j,
(-1)k⁢ϕ1⁢(vk(3))⁢ϕ2⁢(vk(3))u1⁢(vk(3))⁢u2⁢(vk(3))>0.
	

From these inequalities and (3.21), it follows that

	
(-1)k⁢vj⁢(vk(j))>0,j=1,2,3.
	

odd number (with account of multiplicities) of μk(j) s. Suppose that there are three or more of them between vk(j) and vk+1(j). Then comparing (3.22) and (3.23) with (3.1) and (3.2), we conclude that there are no μp(j),s between some vk′(j) and vk′+1′(j), where k≠k′, a contradiction. Thus, v1(j)⁢2<μ2(j)⁢2<v2(j)⁢2<⋯. If vj⁢(0)>0, then 0<μ1(j)<v1(j). If vj⁢(0)=0, then μ1(j)=0. If vj⁢(0)<0, then μ1(j) is a pure imaginary number and hence μ1(j)⁢2<v1(j)⁢2. Proposition 3.3 is proved.

Let j∈{1,2}. It follows from (3.24) and the asymptotic relations (3.1) and (3.22) that the sequences {vk(j)}-∞,k≠0∞ and {μk(j)}-∞,k≠0∞ satisfy the conditions of [20, Theorem 3.4.1]. Thus, there exists a unique real-valued function qj⁢(x)∈L2⁢(0,a) such that {vk(j)}-∞,k≠0∞ and {μk(j)}-∞,k≠0∞ are the spectra of the boundary-value problems Lj and Lj′, respectively. An algorithm for the reconstruction of this potential qj⁢(x) is as follows (see [20, Section 3.4]): without loss of generality, let us assume that μ1(j)⁢2>0, otherwise we apply a shift. The function

	
ej⁢(λ)=e-i⁢λ⁢a⁢(vj⁢(λ)+i⁢λ⁢uj⁢(λ))
	

is the so-called Jost function of the corresponding prolonged Sturm-Liouville problem on the semiaxis:

	
-yj′′⁢(x)+q~j⁢(x)⁢yj⁢(x)=λ2⁢yj⁢(x),x∈[0,∞),yj⁢(0)=0,
	




ISRN Applied Mathematics 19 where

	
q~j⁢(x)={qj⁢(x)	 if ⁢x∈[0,a],
0	 if ⁢x∈(a,∞)
	

Then we construct the S-function of the problem on the semi-axis:

	
Sj⁢(λ)=ej⁢(λ)ej⁢(-λ)
	

and the function

	
Fj⁢(x)=12⁢π⁢∫-∞∞(1-Sj⁢(λ))⁢ei⁢λ⁢x⁢𝑑λ
	

Solving the Marchenko integral equation

	
Kj⁢(x,t)+Fj⁢(x+t)+∫x∞Kj⁢(x,s)⁢Fj⁢(x+s)⁢𝑑s=0,t>x,
	

we find the unique solution Kj⁢(x,t) and

	
qj⁢(x)=-2⁢d⁢Kj⁢(x,x)d⁢x,x∈[0,a].
	

The two sequences {vk(3)}-∞,k≠0∞ and {μk(3)}-∞,k≠0∞ satisfy (due to (3.2), (3.23) and (3.24)) the conditions of [19, Theorem 1.5.4]. Thus, there exists a unique real-valued function q3⁢(x)∈ L2⁢(0,a) and a unique real number h such that {vk(3)}-∞,k≠0∞ and {μk(3)}-∞,k≠0∞ are the spectra of the boundary-value problems L3 and L3′, respectively. Below we give the algorithm of recovering of q3⁢(x) as it is described in [19, Section 1.5]. Calculate the so-called weight numbers {αk}1∞ of the problem L3′ by

	
αk=12⁢μk(3)⁢v˙3⁢(μk(3))⁢u3⁢(μk(3)),
	

where v˙3⁢(λ)=(d/d⁢λ)⁢v3⁢(λ). If μ1(3)=0, then v˙3⁢(μ1(3))=0 and we set α1=(1/2)⁢v¨3⁢(0)⁢u3⁢(0) where v¨⁢(λ)=(d2/d⁢λ2)⁢v3⁢(λ). Construct the function

	
F⁢(x,t)=∑k=1∞(cos⁡μk(3)⁢2⁢x⁢cos⁡μk(3)⁢2⁢tαk-cos⁡(k-1)⁢x⁢cos⁡(k-1)⁢tαk0)
	




20 ISRN Applied Mathematics where

	
αk0={a2,	k>1

Then using the unique solution of the Gel’fand-Levitan integral equation

	
K3⁢(x,t)+F⁢(x,t)+∫0xK3⁢(x,s)⁢F⁢(s,t)⁢𝑑s=0,0≤t≤x≤a,
	

we find

	
q3⁢(x)=2⁢d⁢K3⁢(x,x)d⁢x,h=K3⁢(0,0)=B3-12⁢∫0aq3⁢(x)⁢𝑑x
	

To find β, we compare (2.21) and (3.4) and set

	
β=6⁢B0-32⁢B1-32⁢B2-3⁢B3
	

where B0 can be determined by

	
B0=limk→∞⁡k⁢π⁢(λk(2)-k⁢π+sin-1⁡2/3a).
	

Now we prove that the spectrum of the problem L0 which is generated by the obtained [qj⁢(x)]j=1,2,3,⁢h and β coincides with {λk}-∞,k≠0∞. Due to [20, Theorem 3.4.1] and [19, Theorem 1.5.4], the spectra of the problems Lj,j=1,2,3 which are generated by the obtained [qj⁢(x)]j=1,2,3 and h coincide with {pk(j)}-∞,k≠0∞⁢j=1,2,3, respectively. The functions uj⁢(a,λ)⁢(j=1,2,3) where uj⁢(x,λ) is the solution of (1.1) with obtained [qj⁢(x)]j=1,2,3 and h which satisfy the initial conditions (1.3) coincide with uj⁢(λ), since they have the same zeros and the same asymptotics. Also, since uj′⁢(a,λ) and vj⁢(λ)⁢(j=1,2,3) have the same asymptotics and according to [20, Theorem 3.4.1] and [19, Theorem 1.5.4] have the same zeros, hence they coincide. Thus, the values of the function Φ⁢(λ) (defined by (2.5) ) at λ=vk(j) coincide with

	
ϕ1⁢(vk(j))⁢ϕ2⁢(vk(j))
	

for all k∈ℤ\{0} and all j=1,2,3, that is, with the corresponding values of the function ϕ1⁢(λ)⁢ϕ2⁢(λ). This implies that the entire function

	
Δ⁢(λ):=Φ⁢(λ)-ϕ1⁢(λ)⁢ϕ2⁢(λ)
	




ISRN Applied Mathematics 21 of exponential type 3⁢a can be represented as follows:

	
Δ⁢(λ)=t⁢(λ)⁢∏j=13uj⁢(a,λ),
	

where t⁢(λ) is an entire function. Using (2.10) and (3.9) we have

	Δ⁢(λ)=	t⁢(λ)⁢(sin2⁡λ⁢a⁢cos⁡λ⁢aλ2-(B1+B2)⁢cos2⁡λ⁢a⁢sin⁡λ⁢aλ3+B3⁢sin3⁡λ⁢aλ3+ω1⁢(λ)λ3),	
	ϕ1⁢(λ)⁢ϕ2⁢(λ)=	2⁢sin⁡λ⁢a-3⁢sin3⁡λ⁢aλ+(6⁢B0+12⁢B1+12⁢B2)⁢sin2⁡λ⁢a⁢cos⁡λ⁢aλ2	
		-(B1+B2)⁢cos3⁡λ⁢aλ2+E1′⁢sin3⁡λ⁢aλ3+E2′⁢cos2⁡λ⁢a⁢sin⁡λ⁢aλ3+ω2⁢(λ)λ3,	

where E1′,E2′ are constants and ω1⁢(λ),ω2⁢(λ)∈L3⁢a. Substituting (2.23) and (3.44) into (3.42) and using (3.39), we obtain

	
t⁢(λ)⁢(λ⁢sin2⁡λ⁢a⁢cos⁡λ⁢a-(B1+B2)⁢cos2⁡λ⁢a⁢sin⁡λ⁢a+B3⁢sin3⁡λ⁢a+ω1⁢(λ))
=(E1-E1′)⁢sin3⁡λ⁢a+(E2-E2′)⁢cos2⁡λ⁢a⁢sin⁡λ⁢a+ω3⁢(λ),
	

where ω3⁢(λ)∈L3⁢a. Since the functions sin3⁡λ⁢a,cos2⁡λ⁢a⁢sin⁡λ⁢a,ω1⁢(λ) and ω3⁢(λ) are bounded on the real axis, hence relation (3.45) implies that t⁢(λ)≡0 and from (3.42), it follows that Φ⁢(λ)=ϕ1⁢(λ)⁢ϕ2⁢(λ). Consequently, the sequence {λk}-∞,k≠0∞ coincides with the spectrum of the boundary-value problem L0. The operator A constructed by (1.6) using the obtained [qj⁢(x)]j=1,2,3,h and β is strictly positive, because it is self-adjoint and its spectrum is positive. The uniqueness of the solution of the inverse problem follows from the fact that formulas (3.18) and (3.19) establishes one-to-one correspondence between l2 and La (see [28, Theorem A]). The proof of Theorem 3.1 is finished.

Remark 3.4. If condition 1(ii) of Theorem 3.1 fails, that is, the sets {vk(j)}-∞,k≠0′∞⁢j=1,2,3 are not pairwise disjoint (consequently, the condition 3 fails too), either the uniqueness or the existence result of mentioned theorem can also fails, for the same reasons as in the case of three spectra (see [27,29]). If the sequences {λk}-∞,k≠0∞ and {κk}-∞∞=⋃j=13{vk(j)}-∞,k≠0∞⁢⋃{0} are not pairwise disjoint and satisfy the statements of Theorem 2.13, then the solution of the inverse problem exists but is not unique.",1313.34048.tex,1264.34048.tex,Formula Manipulation; Different Presentation; Paraphrase

Comparing coefficients by the same powers of λ in terms consisting of the matrix δi⁢j⁢eλ⁢Γj⁢(y) as well as in terms free from it and integrating by parts a required number of times, we get:

	
P0⁢Λ=Λ⁢P0,
P0′+P1⁢Λ=Λ⁢P1+DII⁢P0,
P1′+P2⁢Λ=Λ⁢P2+DII⁢P1+DI⁢II⁢DII⁢I⁢P0⁢Λ-1,
Λ⁢M0=DII⁢I⁢Y⁢DI⁢II⁢(-12)⁢Λ-1⁢(-12).
	

Then, from equality (5.34) we necessarily have that P0⁢(y) is a diagonal matrix,

	
P0⁢(y)=(p1⁢(y)	0
0	p2⁢(y)),
	

and equality (5.35) for the case of diagonal elements gives us the Cauchy problem

	
pi′=di⁢iI⁢pi,pi⁢(-12)=1,i=1,2,
	

where di⁢iI are the diagonal elements of the matrix D (see formulas (5.25)). Solving problems (5.38), we find functions pi⁢(y) :

	
pi⁢(y)=e-∫-12ydi⁢iI⁢(ξ)⁢𝑑ξ,i=1,2
	

(below the top index I is omitted). Now equality (5.35) enable us to define off-diagonal elements of the matrix P1⁢(y). At the same time, diagonal elements are found from equality (5.36) . By induction we can find all the matrices Pi⁢(y),i=1,2,…. Equalities similar to (5.37) enable one to define the matrices Mi,i=0,1,….

20 A.M. Blokhin, D.L. Tkachev The presence of the free term DI⁢II⁢(∑i=310Ci⁢YI⁢Ii) due to the method of variation of constants leads to the appearance of additional terms in representation (5.31) which contain powers 1λ (i.e., 1λk,k=1,…) as multipliers. As will see below such terms do not influence on the main term of the asymptotic representation of the spectrum and, so, in representation (5.31) we can consider only the main term:

	
Y^=P0⁢(y)⁢δi⁢j⁢eλ⁢Γj⁢(y).
	

Remembering about the fundamental matrix of equation (5.28), together with equation (5.39) we obtain the main term of the asymptotic representation of the fundamental matrix WY~ for system (5.24): where yij,i,j=3,…,10 are components of the fundamental system for (5.28) composed from columns of the matrix Y⁢(y).

Remark 5.2. In this work we do not give a justification that representation (5.31) is indeed an asymptotic series as well as the described representation for the fundamental matrix WY^ (or, more precisely, for its ”complete” version) is also the subjectfor future research. We only note that such a fact was established by Birkhoff 24] for equation (5.30) (when in the right-hand side of (5.30) there are no terms with the coefficients M0,M1,…, i.e., there is no part of series corresponding to the integral term of equation (5.30). In this case in each of the half-planes Re⁡λ>0 and Re⁡λ<0 asymptotic series are different from each other [25]. By the way, considering the integral term as the free one and using the method of variation of constants, we can find the matrices M0,M1,… by another way (the idea of finding the fundamental matrix by using the method of variation of constants is described in [26] ).","Lets write only two elements of the matrix C which will be used below:

	
c11=-12α^2Z^(i⁢ω⁢u^+R44+2⁢α^12⁢R43α^2α^2)+12(-iωu^1Z^⁢α^2-Z^′Z^-i⁢ω⁢α^12α^2-α^12Z^×

		×(ArZ^a^12+AmσmL^(1+λ^))Z^α^2-σm⁢(1+λ^)2bm⁢Z^⁢α^2)-12α^2Z^(Z^α^2)′	

Let us get an asymptotic representation for the fundamental matrix of system (3.6). For this purpose we split the matrix C into blocks corresponding to representation (3.5) of the matrix W : the first diagonal block corresponds to the nonzero diagonal elements -1z~^⁢α^2 and 1Z~^⁢α^2 whereas the second diagonal block corresponds, on the contrary, to zero elements. Then, system (3.6) can be written in the

16 A. M. Blokhin, D. L. Tkachev more convenient form

	
Y′=(YI
YI⁢I)′=(λ⁢W+C)⁢(YI
YI⁢I)
	

where

	
C=(CII	CI⁢II
CII⁢I	CI⁢II⁢I)
	

Using splitting (3.9) of the matrix C, we get the following system for the vector YI⁢I

	
(YI⁢I)′=CI⁢II⁢I⁢YI⁢I+CII⁢I⁢YI
	

Assuming that the vector YI is known, we can write down a system of fundamental solutions associated with the homogeneous system:

	
YI⁢I=∑i=310ci⁢YI⁢Ii
	

where ci are arbitrary complex constants, i=3,…,10,YI⁢Ii|y=-12=|⋮
0
1
0| is the i th component, and the general solution of system (3.10) is

	
YI⁢I=∑i=310ci⁢YI⁢Ii+∫-12yY⁢(y)⁢Y-1⁢(s)⁢CII⁢I⁢YI⁢𝑑s
	

where Y⁢(y) is the fundamental matrix composed by the vectors YI⁢Ii. Due to representation (3.11) the system for other component YI can be written as

	YI′=λ(-1Z^⁢α^2	0
0	1Z^⁢α^2)YI+CIIYI+CI⁢II(∑i=310ciYI⁢Ii)+CI⁢II×	
		×∫-12yY(y)Y-1(s)CII⁢IYI(s)ds	

Considering CI⁢II⁢(∑i=310ci⁢YI⁢Ii) as a free term, we can find the fundamental matrix for system (3.12) in the following form:

	
Y^=(P0⁢(y)+1λ⁢P1⁢(y)+1λ2⁢P2⁢(y)+…)⁢(δi⁢j⁢eλ⁢Γj⁢(y))+M0λ2+M1λ3+…,i,j=1,2,

Comparing the coefficients by the same powers of λ which may contain the matrix (δi⁢j⁢eλ⁢Γj⁢(s))i,j=1,2 or be independent on it and integrating by parts a needed number of times, we, in particular, get

18 A. M. Blokhin, D. L. Tkachev Then, it follows from equality (3.15) that P0⁢(y) is a diagonal matrix,

	
P0⁢(y)=(p1⁢(y)	0

and equality (3.16) for the case of diagonal elements gives the Cauchy problems

	
pi′=ci⁢iI⁢pi,pi⁢(-12)=1,i=1,2,
	

where ci⁢iI are diagonal elements of the matrix CII (see formulas (3.7)). as multipliers the powers of 1λ:1λk,k=1,2,…. It becomes then clear that such terms do not influence on the main term in the asymptotic representation of the spectrum. This means that we can use only the main term in representation (3.13):

	
Y=P0(y)(δi⁢jeλ⁢Γj⁢(y))i,j=1,2.  (3.20) 
	

Recalling the fundamental matrix of equation (3.8) and taking into account (3.20), we get the main term in the asymptotic representation of the fundamental matrix WY of system (3.8): where yij,i,j=3,…,10 are components of the fundamental system for equation (3.10) composed by the columns of the matrix Y⁢(y).

Without cyclic points, the Hasse diagram of Whyburn Alexandroff spaces with n points is exactly a forest of labeled rooted trees of height at most 1. So, their numbers is exactly the number H⁢(n).

"Theorem 3.3. A necessary and sufficient condition that a fuzzy metric space (X,M,*) be complete is that every nested sequence of nonempty closed sets {Fn}n=1∞ with fuzzy diameter zero have nonempty intersection.

Proof. First suppose that the given condition is satisfied. We claim that (X,M,*) is complete. Let {xn} be a Cauchy sequence in X. Take An= {xn,xn+1,xn+2,…} and Fn=A¯n, then we claim that {Fn} has fuzzy diameter zero. For given s,t>0,0<s<1, we can find a r∈(0,1), such that (1-r)*(1-r)*(1-r)>(1-s). Since {xn} is a Cauchy sequence, for r,t>0,0<r<1, there exists n0∈N such that M⁢(xn,xm,t/3)>1-r for all m,n⩾n0. Therefore, M⁢(x,y,t/3)>1-r for all x,y∈Ana.

Let x,y∈Fn0. Then there exist sequences {xn′} and {yn′} in An0 such that xn′ converges to x and yn′ converges to y. Hence xn′∈B⁢(x,r,t/3) and yn′⁢ϵ B⁢(y,r,t/3) for sufficiently large n. Now

	M⁢(x,y,t)⩾	M⁢(x,xn′,t/3)*M⁢(xn′,yn′,t/3)	
		*M⁢(yn′,y,t/3)	
	>	(1-r)*(1-r)*(1-r)>1-s.	

Therefore, M⁢(x,y,t)>1-s for all x,y∈Fn0. Thus {Fn} has fuzzy diameter zero. Hence by hypothesis ⋂n=1∞Fn is nonempty.

Take x∈⋂n=1∞Fn. Then for r,t>0,0<r<1 there exists n1 such that M⁢(xn,x,t)>1-r for all n⩾n1. Therefore, for each t>0,M⁢(xn,x,t) converges to 1 as n tends to ∞. Hence xn converges to x. Therefore, (X,M,*) is a complete fuzzy metric space.

Conversely, suppose that (X,M,*) is fuzzy complete and {Fn}n=1∞ is a nested sequence of nonempty closed sets with fuzzy diameter zero. Let xn∈Fn, n=1,2,3,… Since {Fn} has fuzzy diameter zero, for r,t>0,0<r<1, there exists n0∈N such that M⁢(x,y,t)>1-r for all x,y∈Fn0. Therefore, M⁢(xn,xm,t/3)>1-r for all n,m⩾n0. Since xn∈ Fn⊂Fn0 and xm∈Fm⊂Fn0,{xn} is a Cauchy sequence. But (X,M,*) is a complete fuzzy metric space and hence xn converges to x for some x∈X. Now for each fixed n,xk∈Fn for all k⩾n. Therefore, x∈F¯n=Fn for every n, and hence x∈⋂n=1∞Fn. This completes our proof.

Remark 3.4. The element x∈⋂n=1∞Fn is unique. For if there are two elements x,y∈⋂n=1∞Fn, since {Fn}n=1∞ has fuzzy diameter zero, for each fixed t>0,M⁢(x,y,t)>1-1/n, for each n. This implies M⁢(x,y,t)=1 and hence x=y.

Corollary 3.5. A necessary and sufficient condition that a metric space (X,d) be complete is that every nested sequence of nonempty closed sets {Fn}n=1∞ with diameter tending to zero have nonempty intersection.","Theorem 2.11. A fuzzy quasimetric space (X,M,*) is M^-complete if and only if every nested sequence {Fn}n∈ℕ of nonempty closed sets with fuzzy diameter zero has nonempty intersection.

Proof. First, suppose that the given condition is satisfied. We claim that (X,M,*) is M^ complete. Let {xn} be a M^-Cauchy sequence in X. Set Bn={xk:k⩾n} and Fn=Bn¯, then we claim that {Fn} has a fuzzy diameter zero. For given s∈(0,1) and t>0, we choose r∈(0,1) such that (1-r)*(1-r)*(1-r)>1-s. Since {xn} is M^-Cauchy sequence, there exists n0∈ℕ such that M^⁢(xn,xm,(1/3)⁢t)>1-r for all m,n⩾n0. Therefore, M^⁢(x,y,(1/3)⁢t)>1-r for all x,y∈Bn0. Let x,y∈Fn0. Then there exist sequences {xn′} and {yn′} in Bn0 such that xn′→x and yn′→y. Hence xn′∈B⁢(x,r,t/3) and yn′∈B⁢(y,r,t/3) for sufficiently large n. Now we have M^⁢(x,y,t)⩾M^⁢(x,xn′,t/3)*M^⁢(xn′,yn′,t/3)*M^⁢(yn′,y,t/3)>(1-r)*(1-r)*(1-r)>1-s. Therefore, M^⁢(x,y,t)>1-s for all x,y∈Fn0. Thus {Fn} has fuzzy diameter zero and hence by hypothesis ⋂n∈ℕFn is nonempty.

Take x∈⋂n∈ℕFn. We show that xn→x. Then, for r∈(0,1) and t>0, there exists n1∈ℕ such that M^⁢(xn,x,t)>1-r for all n⩾n1. Therefore, for each t>0,M^⁢(xn,x,t)→1 as n→∞ and hence xn→x. Therefore, (X,M,*) is M^-complete.

Conversely, suppose that (X,M,*) is M^-complete and {Fn}n∈ℕ is nested sequence of non empty closed sets with fuzzy diameter zero. For each n∈ℕ, choose a point xn∈Fn. We claim that {xn} is a M^-Cauchy sequence. Since {Fn} has fuzzy diameter zero, for t>0 and r∈(0,1), there exists n0∈ℕ such that M^⁢(x,y,t)>1-r for all x,y∈Fn0. Since {Fn} is a nested sequence, M^⁢(xn,xm,t)>l-r for all n,m⩾n0. Hence {xn} is a M^-Cauchy sequence. Since (X,M,*) is M^-complete, xn→x for some x∈X. Therefore, x∈Fn¯=Fn for every n, and hence x∈⋂n∈ℕFn. This completes the proof.

Remark 2.12. The element x∈⋂n∈ℕFn is unique. For if there are two elements x,y∈⋂n∈ℕFn since {Fn} has a fuzzy diameter zero, for each fixed t>0,M⁢(x,y,t)>1-1/n for each n∈ℕ. This implies that M⁢(x,y,t)=1 and hence x=y.

"In this paper, we study some properties on Alexandroff spaces and for each property we derive its equivalent statement in order theoretical terms. Generally, each separation or connectedness property has its order theoretical counterpart. These correspondences have been widely studied and counting such topologies is still an open problem. For instance, the problem of counting the number of quasi-orders Qn (or equivalently, the number of topologies on a n-set) and the number of partial orders Pn (or equivalently, the number of T0 topologies on a n-set) remains unsolved. The numbers Qn and Pn are known for only n≤18 (see [23]).","Counting topologies on finite sets is an old and challenging question [10]. The number of topologies on an n-element set is only known for n≤18 (see [20]). Recently, Campo and Erné established formulas for the number of all downsets of a finite poset P. Using these numbers, they determined the number of all posets having a fixed set of minimal points and inducing the poset P on the non-minimal points.

In this paper, we give order-theoretical descriptions of specific classes of Alexandroff spaces such us submaximal, door, Whyburn and weakly Whyburn spaces.

6. CONCLUSIONS Enriched weight functions were introduced in a meshless method formulation to capture the singularity of the stress field at crack tips. They permitted to accurately evaluate the stress intensity factors with few degrees of freedom. The method was applied to the simulation of fatigue fracture of single- or multi-cracked bodies under constant amplitude cyclic loading with the help of Paris’ law. The real curved path of crack growth was simulated by piecewise linear increments. The direction of crack growth was predicted by the maximum principal stress criterion. Numerical results showed good agreement with boundary element method results.,"8 Conclusions

An intrinsic enriched meshless method was introduced. The weight functions were enriched to capture the singularity of the stress field at crack tips. They permitted to accurately evaluate the stress intensity factors with few degrees of freedom. The method was applied to mode I and mixed mode problems and we showed that accuracy is improved significantly. The computational overhead was minor. We also compared numerical results to experimental data and the results showed good agreement.",1060.74664.tex,1258.74210.tex,Paraphrase; Variation of subject

Proof. For each n∈ℕ define Un={(x,y)∈X×X:M⁢(x,y,1/n)>1-(1/n)}.

We shall prove that {Un:n∈ℕ} is a base for a uniformity 𝒰 on X whose induced topology coincides with τM :

We first note that for each n∈ℕ, {(x,x):x∈X}⊆Un,Un+1⊆Un and Un=Un-1

On the other hand, for each n∈ℕ, there is, by the continuity of *, an m∈ℕ such that

m>2⁢n and (1-(1/m))*(1-(1/m))>1-(1/n).

Then, Um∘Um⊆Un : Indeed, let (x,y)∈Um and (y,z)∈Um. Since M⁢(x,y,⋅) is nondecreasing [4], M⁢(x,z,1/n)⩾M⁢(x,z,2/m). So

	M	(x,z,1/n)	
		⩾M⁢(x,y,1/m)*M⁢(y,z,1/m)	
		⩾(1-(1/m))*(1-(1/m))>1-(1/n).	

Therefore (x,z)∈Un. Thus {Un:n∈ℕ} is a base for a uniformity 𝒰 on X.

Since for each x∈X and each n∈ℕ,Un(x)= {y∈X:M⁢(x,y,1/n)>1-(1/n)}=B⁢(x,1/n,1/n), we deduce, from Lemma 2 , that the topology induced by 𝒰 coincides with τM.

We claim that {Un:n∈ℕ} is a base for quasiuniformity 𝒰 on X whose induced topology coincides with τM. It is clear that {(x,x):x∈X}⊆Un,Un+1⊆Un. Also (by continuity of * ) for each n∈ℕ, there is an m such that m>2⁢n and (1-(1/m))*(1-(1/m))>1-(1/n). Then Um∘Um⊆Un. Let M(x,y,1/m)*M(y,z,1/m)≥(1-(1/m))*(1-(-(1/m)>1-1/n. Therefore (x,z)∈Un.

If (M,*) is a KM-fuzzy quasi-pseudo-metric on X satisfying: (KM2”) x=y if and only if M⁢(x,y,t)=1 for all t>0,

It is clear that every KM-fuzzy metric is a T1 KM-fuzzy quasimetric; every T1⁢KM-fuzzy quasi-metric is a KM-fuzzy quasi-metric, and every KM-fuzzy quasi-metric is a KM-fuzzy quasi-pseudo-metric.

Definition 2.5. A KM-fuzzy quasi-(pseudo-)metric space is a triple (X,M,*) such that X is a (nonempty) set and (M,*) is a KM-fuzzy quasi-(pseudo)metric on X.

The notions of a T1 KM-fuzzy quasi-metric space and of a KM-fuzzy (pseudo)metric space are defined in the obvious manner. Note that the KM-fuzzy metric spaces are exactly the fuzzy metric spaces in the sense of Kramosil and Michalek.

If (M,*) is a KM-fuzzy quasi-(pseudo-)metric on a set X, it is immediate to show that (M-1,*) is also a KM-fuzzy quasi-(pseudo-)metric on X, where M-1 is the fuzzy set in X×X×[0,+∞) defined by M-1⁢(x,y,t)=M⁢(y,x,t). Moreover, if we denote by Mi the fuzzy set in X×X×[0,+∞) given by Mi⁢(x,y,t)=min⁡{M⁢(x,y,t),M-1⁢(x,y,t)}, then (Mi,*) is, clearly, a KM-fuzzy (pseudo-)metric on X.

If M satisfies conditions (FM-1), (FM-2), (FM-4), (FM-5), and (FM-6), then we call (M,*) a T1 fuzzy quasimetric on X.

"In this paper, we devote our attention to the stability and bifurcation analysis of system (1.3). To the best of our knowledge, few results for system (1.3) have been obtained in the literature up to now. Our research shows that system (1.3) can only be asymptotically stable or unstable depending on the delays and that its associated characteristic equation may have simultaneously two pairs of purely imaginary roots at some certain critical values. When the delay τ passes through some critical values, the positive equilibrium loses (or regains) its stability and Hopf bifurcations occur. One most interesting phenomenon is that under certain conditions, the positive equilibrium may switch a finite number of times between being stable and unstable, but always becomes unstable eventually. Assuming that the associated charformulae determining the direction of the Hopf bifurcations and the stability of the bifurcating periodic solutions are given and the conditions ensuring the global continuation of local Hopf bifurcations for system (1.3) are also determined.

λ2+s+p⁢λ⁢e-λ⁢τ+q⁢e-2⁢λ⁢τ=0
	

where p=α1+r2,q=α1⁢r2 and s=γ⁢r2⁢α2. To study the stability of the equilibrium E* and the Hopf bifurcation of (1.3), it is sufficient to study the distribution of roots of (2.3). Obviously, λ=0 is not a root of (2.3). For τ=0, the characteristic equation becomes

	
λ2+p⁢λ+(q+γ)=0,
	

from which we immediately have the following lemma. LEMMA 2.1 When τ=0,(2.3) always has two roots with negative real parts. Now for τ>0, if λ=i⁢ω⁢(ω>0) is a root of (2.3), then we have

	
-ω2+s+i⁢p⁢ω⁢e-i⁢ω⁢τ+q⁢e-2⁢i⁢ω⁢τ=0.
	




A DELAYED LESLIE-GOWER PREDATOR-PREY SYSTEM 577 Separating the real and imaginary parts, we have

	
-ω2+s+p⁢ω⁢sin⁡(ω⁢τ)+q⁢cos⁡(2⁢ω⁢τ)=0
	

and

	
p⁢ω⁢cos⁡(ω⁢τ)-q⁢sin⁡(2⁢ω⁢τ)=0.
	

Subtracting the two sides of (2.5) times sin⁡(ω⁢τ) from the corresponding sides of (2.4) times cos⁡(ω⁢τ) and adding the two sides of (2.4) times sin⁡(ω⁢τ) to the corresponding sides of (2.5) times cos⁡(ω⁢τ), one can obtain

	
{(-ω2+s+q)⁢cos⁡(ω⁢τ)=0
(-ω2+s-q)⁢sin⁡(ω⁢τ)+p⁢ω=0
	

If -ω2+s+q=0, i.e. ω=q+s, then from the second equation of (2.6) we can get that sin⁡(ω⁢τ)= p⁢q+s2⁢q. However, one can easily get p⁢q+s2⁢q⩾q+sq>1 from the fact that p⩾2⁢q. Accordingly, sin⁡(ω⁢τ)=p⁢q+s2⁢q cannot hold and we have -ω2+s+q≠0. Thus, from the first equation of (2.6), we know that cos⁡(ω⁢τ)=0 and so sin⁡(ω⁢τ)=±1. If sin⁡(ω⁢τ)=1, then the second equation of (2.6) becomes

	
ω2-p⁢ω+q-s=0.
	

Noting that q≠s (otherwise, ω=0 is a root of (2.7), a contradiction), it is easy to see that if q<s, then (2.7) has only one positive root ω1+, and if q>s, then (2.7) has two positive roots (since p2⩾4⁢q )

	
ω1±=p±p2-4⁢(q-s)2.
	

If sin⁡(ω⁢τ)=-1, it follows from the second equation of (2.6) that

	
ω2+p⁢ω+q-s=0,
	

from which we know that if q>s, then (2.9) has no positive root, and if q<s, then (2.9) has only one positive root

	
ω2+=-p+p2-4⁢(q-s)2.
	

Consequently, if we define

	
τ1,j±=1ω1±⁢(π2+2⁢j⁢π),τ2,j+=1ω2+⁢(3⁢π2+2⁢j⁢π),j=0,1,…,
	

then when τ=τ1,j±(τ=τ2,j+, respectively), (2.2) has a pair of purely imaginary roots ±iω1±(±iω2+, respectively). Denote by

578 S. YUAN AND Y. SONG LEMMA 2.2 The following transversality conditions are satisfied:

	
dRe⁡λ⁢(τ)d⁢τ|τ=τ1,j±>0  and  dRe⁡λ⁢(τ)d⁢τ|τ=τ2,j+<0.
	

Proof. Substituting λ⁢(τ) into (2.3) and taking the derivative with respect to τ, we have

	
[d⁢λd⁢τ]-1=2⁢λ+p⁢e-λ⁢τp⁢λ2⁢e-λ⁢τ+2⁢q⁢λ⁢e-2⁢λ⁢τ-τλ.
	

From the above discussion, we can easily have that

	
dRe⁢λ⁢(τ1,j±)d⁢τ=ω1±⁢(2⁢q-p⁢ω1±)p-2⁢ω1±,dRe⁢λ⁢(τ2,j+)d⁢τ=-ω2+⁢(2⁢q+p⁢ω2+)p+2⁢ω2+
	

Obviously, dRe⁡λ⁢(τ2,j+)d⁢τ<0. Noting that p2⩾4⁢q and from (2.8), we immediately have that ω1+>p2 and ω1-<2⁢qp⩽p2. It then follows from (2.13) that dRe⁢λ⁢(τ1,j±)d⁢τ>0. Thus, the proof is complete.

From Lemmas 2.1 and 2.2, we can obtain the following results about the distribution of the characteristic roots of (2.3).

Furthermore, if τ∈[0,τ1,0+), then all roots of (2.3) have negative real parts; if τ=τ1,0+, then all roots of (2.3) except ±i⁢ω1+have negative real parts, and if τ>τ1,0+, then (2.3) has at least one root with positive real part. (2) If q<s (i.e. α1<γ⁢α2 ) and τ=τ1,j+(τ=τ2,j+, respectively), then (2.3) has a pair of imaginary roots ±iω1+(±iω2+, respectively). Furthermore, (a) if 15⁢p2⩾4⁢(s-q), then when τ∈[0,τ1,0+), all roots of (2.3) have negative real parts; when τ=τ1,0+, all roots of (2.3) except ±i⁢ω1+have negative real parts, and when τ>τ1,0+, (2.3) has at least one root with positive real part; (b) if 15⁢p2<4⁢(s-q), there is a positive integer κ such that when

	
τ∈[0,τ1,0+)⁢⋃(τ2,0+,τ1,1+)⁢⋃⋯⁢⋃(τ2,κ-1+,τ1,κ+),
	

then all roots of (2.3) have negative real parts; when τ=τ1,j+,j=0,1,2,…,κ(τ= τ2,j+,j=0,1,…,κ-1, respectively), then all roots of (2.3) except ±iω1+(±iω2+, respectively) have negative real parts, and when

	
τ∈(τ1,0+,τ2,0+)⁢⋃(τ1,1+,τ2,1+)⁢⋃⋯⁢⋃(τ1,κ-1+,τ2,κ-1+)  and  τ>τ1,κ+,
	

then (2.3) has at least one root with positive real part.

A DELAYED LESLIE-GOWER PREDATOR-PREY SYSTEM 579 Proof. (1) The conclusion follows from Lemmas 2.1 and 2.2 and the argument above. (2) Noting that both τ1,1+and τ2,0+are greater than τ1,0+and that

	
2⁢πω1+=τ1,j+-τ1,j-1+<τ2,j+-τ2,j-1+=2⁢πω2+,
	

by employing Rouché’s theorem (in the form of the lemma in Cooke & Grossman, 1982), it follows from Lemmas 2.1 and 2.2 that if τ2,0+⩾τ1,1+(i.e. 15⁢p2⩾4⁢(s-q) ), then (2.3) has at least one root with positive real part when τ>τ1,0+, i.e. case (a) holds; if τ2,0+<τ1,1+(i.e. 15⁢p2<4⁢(s-q) ), then case (b) holds.

REMARK 2.1 In Lemma 2.3 case (1) (i.e. q>s ), there may have the scenario that τ1,k-=τ1,j+(denoted by τ¯ ) for some k and j (obviously, j⩾1 and k≠j ). Equation (2.3) has two pairs of purely imaginary roots ±i⁢ω1+and ±i⁢ω1-when τ=τ¯. Furthermore, if we denote by

	
λ1⁢(τ)=α1⁢(τ)+i⁢ω1⁢(τ),λ2⁢(τ)=α2⁢(τ)+i⁢ω2⁢(τ)
	

the roots of (2.3) near τ¯ satisfying λ1⁢(τ¯)=i⁢ω1+and λ2⁢(τ¯)=i⁢ω1-, respectively, then by Lemma 2.2, we have αi′⁢(τ¯)>0⁢(i=1,2).

Similarly, in Lemma 2.3 case (2) (i.e. q<s ), there may have the scenario that τ1,j1+=τ2,j2+(denoted by τ^ ) for some j1 and j2 (obviously, j1⩾1 and j2≠j1 ). Equation (2.3) has two pairs of purely imaginary roots ±i⁢ω1+and ±i⁢ω2+when τ=τ^. Furthermore, if we denote by

	
λ1⁢(τ)=α1⁢(τ)+i⁢ω1⁢(τ),λ2⁢(τ)=α2⁢(τ)+i⁢ω2⁢(τ)
	

the roots of (2.3) near τ^ satisfying λ1⁢(τ^)=i⁢ω1+and λ2⁢(τ^)=i⁢ω2+, respectively, then by Lemma 2.2, we have α1′⁢(τ^)>0 and α2′⁢(τ^)<0.

REMARK 2.2 Assume that q>s, i.e. α1>γ⁢α2, then case (1) in Lemma 2.3 holds. Obviously, τ1,j+<τ1,j-⁢(j=0,1,…). Denote by

	
kj=max⁡{k∣τ1,k-⩽τ1,j+,k=0,1,…}
jk=max⁡{j∣τ1,j+<τ1,k-,j=0,1,…}
	

Then, for some fixed j, (a) if kj does not exist, then (2.3) has at least 2⁢(j+1) roots with positive real parts when τ>τ1,j+; (b) if kj exists, then (2.3) has at least 2⁢(j+kj+2) roots with positive real parts when τ>τ1,j+. Similarly, for some fixed k, (c) (2.3) has at least 2⁢(k+jk+2) roots with positive real parts when τ>τ1,k-. In the following, we only consider the case where the characteristic roots of (2.3) have only a pair of purely imaginary roots at each of the critical values. From Lemma 2.3, we easily obtain the following results about the stability of the positive equilibrium and existence of the Hopf bifurcation of (1.3). THEOREM 2.1 Let ω1±,ω2+and τ1,j±and τ2,j+⁢(j=0,1,…) be defined by (2.8), (2.10) and (2.11), respectively. For system (1.3), we have the following:

System (1.3) undergoes a Hopf bifurcation at E* when τ=τi,j+⁢(i=1,2;j=0,1,…).","Linearizing system (2.1) about the equ’ orium (0,0) yields the following linear system

	
{z1′⁢(t)	=[-a11⁢x*	(t-τ)	a12⁢x*⁢z2⁢(t)],	
z2′⁢(t)	=[a21⁢y*⁢z1	-a	z*⁢z2⁢(t-)],	
	

whose characteristic equation

	
λ2+γ+λ⁢e-λ⁢τ-a⁢e-2⁢λ⁢τ=0,
	

where p=α*+a;*=q=a12a22x21x*x* and γ. To study the stability of the equilibrium E* and the Hopf bifurcation of (-1, sufficient to study the distribution of roots of Eq. (2.2). Obviously, λ= not a root of (2.2). For τ=0 the characteristic equation becomes

	
λ2+p⁢λ+(q+γ)=0,
	

from which we immediately have Lemma 2.1. When τ=0, Eq. (2.2) always has two roots with negative real parts.

S. Yuan, F. Zhang / Nonlinear Analysis: Real World Applications 11 (2010) 959-977 961 Now for τ>0, if λ=i⁢ω⁢(ω>0) is a root of Eq. (2.2), then we have

	
-ω2+γ+i⁢p⁢ω⁢e-i⁢ω⁢τ+q⁢e-2⁢i⁢ω⁢τ=0.
	

Separating the real and imaginary parts, we have

	
-ω2+γ+p⁢ω⁢sin⁡(ω⁢τ)+q⁢cos⁡(2⁢ω⁢τ)=0
	

and

	
p⁢ω⁢cos⁡(ω⁢τ)-q⁢sin⁡(2⁢ω⁢τ)=0
	

Subtracting the two sides of (2.5) times sin⁡(ω⁢τ) from the corresponding sides of (2.4) times cos⁡(ω⁢τ) and adding the two sides of (2.4) times sin⁡(ω⁢τ) to the corresponding sides of (2.5) times cos⁡(ω⁢τ), one can obtain

	
{(-ω2+γ+q)⁢cos⁡(ω⁢τ)=0
(-ω2+γ-q)⁢sin⁡(ω⁢τ)+p⁢ω=0
	

If -ω2+γ+q=0, that is, ω=q+γ, then from the second equation of (2.6) we can get at sin⁡(ω⁢τ)=q+γ2⁢q. However, one can easily get p⁢q+γ2⁢q≥q+γq>1 from the fact that p≥2⁢q. Accordingly, sin⁡(ω⁢τ)=. -ω2+γ+q≠0. Thus, from the first equation of (2.6), we know that cos⁡(ω⁢τ)=0 nd sosin(ω. If sin⁡(ω⁢τ)=1, then the second equation of (2.6) becomes

	
ω2-p⁢ω+q-γ=0
 Noting that ⁢q≠γ⁢ (otherwise, ⁢ω=
 one positive root ⁢ω1+⁢, and if ⁢q>γ,
ω1±=p±p2-4⁢(q-γ)2
	

Noting that q≠γ (otherwise, ω=0 is a root of (2.7), a contradiction), it is f sy to so ?at if q, then Eq. (2.7) has only one positive root ω1+, and if q>γ, then Eq. (2.7) has two positive roots (si e p2≥4q) then when τ=τ1,j±(τ=τ2,j+, respectively), E (2.2)     s a pair y ourely imaginary roots ±iω1±(±iω2+, respectively). Denote by Proof. Substituting λ⁢(τ) (?) and ta’ n g the derivative with respect to τ, we have

	
[d⁢λd⁢τ]-1=ρ⁢λ2⁢e-+2⁢q⁢λ⁢e-+τλ.
	

From the aboy discussi 1 , we easily have that

	
d⁢Re⁡λ⁢(τ1,j±)d⁢τ=(2q-pω1±)±2⁢ω1±,d⁢Re⁡λ⁢(τ2,j+)d⁢τ=-ω2+⁢(2⁢q+p⁢ω2+)p+2⁢ω2+
	

Obviously, d⁢Re⁡λ⁢(τ2,j+)d⁢τ<0. Noting that p2≥4⁢q and from (2.8), we immediately have that ω1+>p2 and ω1-<2⁢qp≤p2, it then follows from (2.13) that d⁢Re⁡λ⁢(τ1,j±)d⁢τ>0. Thus the proof is complete.

962 S. Yuan, F. Zhang / Nonlinear Analysis: Real World Applications 11 (2010) 959-977 From Lemmas 2.1 and 2.2, we can obtain the following results about the distribution of the characteristic roots of Eq. (2.3). Lemma 2.3. Let ω1±,ω2+,τ1,j±and τ2,j+⁢(j=0,1,…) be defined by (2.8), (2.10) and (2.11), respectively. (1) If q>γ (that is, a11a22>a12a21) and τ=τ1,j+(τ=τ1,j-, respectively), then Eq. (2.2) has a pair of imaginary roots ±i⁢ω1+ (±iω1-, respectively). Furthermore, if τ∈[0,τ1,0+), then all the roots of Eq. (2.2) have negative real parts; if τ=τ1,0+, then all the roots of Eq. (2.2) except ±i⁢ω1+have negative real parts; if τ>τ1,0+, then Eq. (2.2) has at least one root with positive real part; (2) If q<γ (that is, a11a22<a12a21) and τ=τ1,j+(τ=τ2,j+, respectively), then Eq. (2.2) has a pair of imaginary roots ±i⁢ω1+ (±iω2+, respectively). Furthermore, (a) if 15⁢p2≥4⁢(γ-q), then when τ∈[0,τ1,0+), all the roots of Eq. (2.2) have negative real parts; when τ=τ1,0+, all the roots of Eq. (2.2) except ±i⁢ω1+have negative real parts; when τ>τ1,0+, Eq. (2.2) has at as wor with positive real part; (b) if 15⁢p2<4⁢(γ-q), there is a positive integer k such that when τ∈[0,τ1,0+)∪(τ2,0+,τ1,1+)∪⋯∪(τ2,k-1+,τ1,k+), then all the roots of Eq. (2.2) have negative real parts; when τ=τ1,j+,j=0,1,…,k(ı=ττ.j+=0,1,…,k-1, respectively), then all the roots of Eq. (2.2) except ±iω1+(±iω2+, respectively ave negrive rea ins and when τ∈(τ1,0+,τ2,0+)∪(τ1,1+,τ2,1+)∪⋯ then Eq. (2.2) has at least one root with po (1) The conclusion follows from Lemmas Noting that both τ1,1+and τ2,0+are greater t 2⁢πω1+=τ1,j+-τ1,j-1+<τ2,j+-τ2,j-1+=2⁢πω2+ Proof. (1) The conclusion follows from Lemmas 2.1 and 2.2 and the argup above. (2) Noting that both τ1,1+and τ2,0+are greater than τ1,0+and that 2⁢πω1+=τ1,j+-τ1,j-1+<τ2,j+-τ2,j-1+=2⁢πω2+, by employing Rouché’s theorem (in the form of the Lemma in oke and Grossman [11]), it follows from Lemmas 2.1 and 2.2 that if τ2,0+≥τ1,1+(that is, 15⁢p2≥4⁢(γ-q) ), then Eq. (2.2 has at least o root with positive real part when τ>τ1,0+, i.e., case (a) holds; if τ2,0+<τ1,1+(that is, 15⁢p2<4⁢(γ-q) ), cas (b) holds.

Remark 2.1. In Lemma 2.3(1) (that is, q>γ ), there may be the so . at τ1,k-=τ1,j+(denoted by τ¯ ) for some k and j (obviously, j≥1 and k≠j ). Eq. (2.2) has two pairs of Tery roots ±i⁢ω1+and ±i⁢ω1-when τ=τ¯. Furthermore, if we denote

	
λ1(τ)=α1(τ)+iω1(τ),λ2(τ)=α2(τ)+iω2(
	

the roots of Eq. (2.2) near τ¯ satisfying λ1′=ω1+and (τ¯)=i⁢ω1-, respectively, then by Lemma 2.2, we have αi′⁢(τ¯)>0⁢(i=1,2)

Similarly, In Lemma 2.3(2) (that is, a< he 2 may have the scenario that τ1,j1+=τ2,j2+(denoted by τ^ ) for some j1 and j2 (obviously, j1≥1 and j2≠j1 ). Eq. (2 has two . . of purely imaginary roots ±i⁢ω1+and ±i⁢ω2+when τ=τ^. Furthermore, if we denote

	
λ1⁢(τ)=α1⁢(τ)+i⁢ω1⁢(τ) λ2=α2⁢(τ)+i⁢ω2⁢(τ)
	

the roots of Eq. (2.2) near τ^⁢c-isfying λ1(τ^)=1+and λ2⁢(τ^)=i⁢ω2+, respectively, then by Lemma 2.2, we have α1′⁢(τ^)>0 and α2′⁢(τ^)<0

Remark 2.2. Assume t +, that is a22111>a12⁢a21, then case (1) in Lemma 2.3 holds. Obviously, τ1,j+<τ1,j-(j= jk=m2⟨j|τ1,j+<1,…} Then, for some (a) if kj does not exist, an Eq. (2.2) has at least 2⁢(j+1) roots with positive real parts when τ>τ1,j+; (b) if kj exists, then Eq. (2.2) has at least 2⁢(j+kj+2) roots with positive real parts when τ>τ1,j+. Similarly, for some fixed k (c) Eq. (2.2) has at least 2⁢(k+jk+2) roots with positive real parts when τ>τ1,k-.

S. Yuan, F. Zhang / Nonlinear Analysis: Real World Applications 11 (2010) 959-977 963 In the following, we only consider the case where the characteristic roots of Eq. (2.2) have only a pair of purely imaginary roots at each of the critical values. From Lemma 2.3, we easily obtain the following results about the stability of the positive equilibrium and existence of Hopf bifurcation of (1.3).

Theorem 2.1. Suppose that r1⁢a21-r2⁢a11>0 and let ω1±,ω2+,τ1,j±and τ2,j+⁢(j=0,1,…) be defined by (2.8), (2.10) and (2.11), respectively. For system (1.1), we have: (1) If q>γ (that is, a11⁢a22>a12⁢a21 ), then E* is asymptotically stable when τ∈[0,τ1,0+) and unstable when τ>τ1,0+. System (1.1) undergoes a Hopf bifurcation at E* when τ=τ1,j±⁢(j=0,1,…); (2) If q<γ (that is, a11⁢a22<a12⁢a21 ) and (a) if 15⁢p2>4⁢(γ-q), then E* is asymptotically stable when τ∈[0,τ1,0+)and unstable when τ>τ1,0+. System (1.1) undergoes a Hopf bifurcation at E* when τ=τi,j+⁢(i=1,2;j=0,1,…); (b) if 15⁢p2<4⁢(γ-q), there is a positive integer k, such that the equilibrium E* switches k t ofro tability to instability to stability; that is, E* is asymptotically stable when τ∈[0,τ1,0+)∪(τ2,0+,τ1,1+)∪⋯∪(τ2,k-1+,τ1,k+), and unstable when τ∈(τ1,0+,τ2,0+)∪(τ1,1+,τ2,1+)∪⋯∪(τ1,k-1+,τ2,k-1+)and τ>τ1,k+.

"3. Direction and stability of the Hopf bifurcation In Section 2, we have shown that the system (1.3) undergoes the Hopf bifurcation at the critical values τ=τ1,j±and τ=τ2,j+⁢(j=0,1,…). In this section, we will employ the algorithm of Faria & Magalháes (1995a,b) to compute explicitly the normal forms of system (1.3) on the centre manifold. After that we will analyse the direction of the Hopf bifurcation and stability of the bifurcating periodic orbits from the positive equilibrium E* of system (1.3) at these critical values of τ. Without loss of generality, denote any one of these critical values τ=τ1,j±and τ=τ2,j+⁢(j=0,1,…) by τ~ at which (2.3) has a pair of purely imaginary roots ±i⁢ω and system (1.3) undergoes a Hopf bifurcation from E*. Throughout this section, we refer to Faria & Magalháes (1995⁢a,b) for explanations of notations involved. We first rescale the time by t⟼t/τ to normalize the delay so that (2.1) can be written as

	
z˙⁢(t)=L⁢(τ)⁢zt+F⁢(zt,τ),
	

in the phase space C=C⁢([-1,0],R2), where for φ=(φ1,φ2)⊤∈C, we have

	
L⁢(τ)⁢(φ)=τ⁢(-α1⁢φ1⁢(-1)-α2⁢φ2⁢(0)
γ⁢r2⁢φ1⁢(0)-r2⁢φ2⁢(-1))
	

and

	
F⁢(φ,τ)=τ⁢(f101(1)⁢φ1⁢(-1)⁢φ1⁢(0)+f110(1)⁢φ1⁢(0)⁢φ2⁢(0)
∑i+j+k⩾21i!⁢j!⁢k!⁢fi⁢j⁢k(2)⁢φ1i⁢(0)⁢φ2j⁢(0)⁢φ2k⁢(-1))
	

We introduce the formal Taylor expansions about φ as follows:

	
F⁢(φ,τ)=12⁢F2⁢(φ,τ)+13!⁢F3⁢(φ,τ)+o⁢(|φ|4),
	




A DELAYED LESLIE-GOWER PREDATOR-PREY SYSTEM 581 where

The linear map L⁢(τ) may be expressed in integral form as

	
L⁢(τ)⁢ϕ=∫-10[d⁢ητ⁢(θ)]⁢ϕ⁢(θ),
	

where η:[-1,0]→R2×2 is a function of bounded variation. Introducing the new parameter μ=τ-τ~ so that μ=0 is a Hopf bifurcation value of (3.1), we can rewrite (3.1) as

	
z˙⁢(t)=L⁢(τ~)⁢zt+F~⁢(zt,μ),
	

where F~⁢(zt,μ)=L⁢(μ)⁢zt+F⁢(zt,τ~+μ). Let ω~=ω⁢τ~ and Λ0={i⁢ω~,-i⁢ω~}. From Lemma 2.3, we know that the characteristic equation of z˙⁢(t)=L⁢(τ~)⁢zt has a pair of simple imaginary roots ±i⁢ω~ and no other roots in the imaginary axis which are multiples of ±i⁢ω~. Thus, the non-resonance conditions relative to Λ0 are satisfied. Let Φ= (ϕ1,ϕ2) be a matrix whose columns form a basis of the centre space P of z˙=L⁢(τ~)⁢zt with ϕ1⁢(θ)= ei⁢ω⁢θ⁢v and ϕ2⁢(θ)=e-i⁢ω~⁢θ⁢v¯, where the bar means complex conjugation, and v is a vector in C2 that satisfies

	
L⁢(τ~)⁢ϕ1=i⁢ω~⁢v
	

With C*=C⁢([0,1];R2⁣*), where R2⁣* is the 2⁢D space of row vectors, we consider the adjoint bilinear form on C*×C defined by

	
⟨ψ⁢(s),ϕ⁢(θ)⟩=ψ⁢(0)⁢ϕ⁢(0)-∫-10∫0θψ⁢(ξ-θ)⁢dητ~⁢(θ)⁢ϕ⁢(ξ)⁢dξ, for ⁢ψ∈C*,ϕ∈C.
	

Suppose Ψ=col⁡(ψ1,ψ2) is a matrix whose rows form a basis for the dual space P* in C* with ⟨Ψ⁢(s),Φ⁢(θ)⟩=I (the 2×2 identity matrix). Then we have Ψ(s)=col(ψ1(s),ψ2(s))=col(u⊤e-i⁢ω~⁢s, u¯⊤ei⁢ω~⁢s),s∈[0,1], for u∈C2 such that

	
⟨ψ1,ϕ1⟩=1,⟨ψ1,ϕ2⟩=0.
	

By straightforward computation, we can choose

	
v=(v1
v2)=(1
-i⁢ω+α1⁢e-i⁢ω~α2),u=(u1
u2)=d⁢(-i⁢ω+r2⁢e-i⁢ω~α2

where d=-α22⁢i⁢ω+{(α1+r2)+τ~⁢[α2⁢r2⁢v2-α1⁢v1⁢(i⁢ω+r2⁢e-i⁢ω~)]}⁢e-i⁢ω¯ such that ⟨Ψ⁢(s),Φ⁢(θ)⟩=I.

582 S. YUAN AND Y. SONG Faria & Magalháes (1995a,b) show that (3.3) can be written as an infinite-dimensional ordinary differential equation on the Banach space B⁢C of functions from [-1,0] into R2 which are uniformly continuous on [-1,0) and with a jump discontinuity at 0 . Elements of B⁢C are of the form ϕ+X0⁢α, where ϕ∈C,α∈R2 and X0⁢(θ) is defined by

	
X0⁢(θ)={1,	θ=0
0,	-r⩽θ<0.
	

Let π:B⁢C→P denote the projection π⁢(φ+X0⁢α)=Φ⁢[⟨Ψ,φ⟩+Ψ⁢(0)⁢α]. We can write B⁢C=P⊕ ker⁡π with the property that Q⊂ker⁡π, where Q is an infinite-dimensional complementary subspace of P in C. Let A be the infinitesimal generator for the flow of the linear system z˙⁢(t)=L⁢(τ~)⁢zt. Decompose zt in (3.3) according to the decomposition of B⁢C, in the form zt=Φ⁢x⁢(t)+yt, with x∈Rm and yt∈ker⁡π∩D⁢(A)=Q∩C1= def Q1, where D⁢(A) is the domain of A. Define the 2×2 diagonal matrix

	
B=(i⁢ω~	0
0	-i⁢ω~)
	

Then (3.3) is equivalent to the following system:

	
x˙=B⁢x+Ψ⁢(0)⁢F~⁢(Φ⁢x+y,μ)
dd⁢t⁢y=AQ1⁢y+(I-π)⁢X0⁢F~⁢(Φ⁢x+y,μ),
	

where AQ1:Q1→ker⁡π is such that AQ1⁢ϕ=ϕ˙+X0⁢[L⁢(τ~)⁢(ϕ)-ϕ˙⁢(0)]. Let F~j be the j th Fréchet derivative of F~ and denote by fj=(fj1,fj2), where

	
1j!⁢fj1⁢(x,y,μ)=Ψ⁢(0)⁢F~j⁢(Φ⁢x+y,μ)
1j!⁢fj2⁢(x,y,μ)=(I-π)⁢X0⁢F~j⁢(Φ⁢x+y,μ),
	

then (3.6) can be written as

	
x˙=B⁢x+∑j⩾21j!⁢fj1⁢(x,y,μ),
dd⁢t⁢y=AQ1⁢y+∑j⩾21j!⁢fj2⁢(x,y,μ)
	

where 1j!⁢fj1⁢(x,y,μ) and 1j!⁢fj2⁢(x,y,μ) are homogeneous polynomials in (x,y,μ) of degree j with coefficients in C2 and ker π, respectively. Since the non-resonance conditions relative to Λ0 are satisfied, the normal form theory due to Faria & Magalháes (1995a,b) implies that the centre manifold is locally given by y=0 and a normal form of (3.3) on this centre manifold of the origin at μ=0 is given by

	
x˙=B⁢x+12⁢g21⁢(x,0,μ)+13!⁢g31⁢(x,0,μ)+ h.o.t. 
	

where g21 and g31 are the second- and third-order terms in (x,μ), respectively, and h.o.t. stands for higher-order terms.

A DELAYED LESLIE-GOWER PREDATOR–PREY SYSTEM 583 Let Vjm+p⁢(X) be the homogeneous polynomials of degree j in m+p real variables, x=(x1,…,xm), μ=(μ1,…,μp), with coefficients in X,

	
Vjm+p⁢(X)={∑|(q,l)|=jc(q,l)⁢xq⁢μl:c(q,l)∈X}  for ⁢(q,l)=(q1,…,qm,l1,…,lp)∈N0m+p
	

with the norm given by the sum of the norms of the coefficients. Define

	
(Mj1⁢p)⁢(x,μ)=Dx⁢p⁢(x,μ)⁢B⁢x-B⁢p⁢(x,μ),
	

where p⁢(x,μ)∈Vj2+1⁢(C2). It follows from Faria & Magalháes (1995b) that

	
Vj3⁢(C2)=Im⁡(Mj1)⊕Ker⁡(Mj1),gj1⁢(x,0,μ)∈Ker⁡(Mj1)
	

and

	
Ker⁡(Mj1)=span⁡{xq⁢μl⁢ek:q1⁢λ1+q2⁢λ2=λk,k=1,2,q∈N02,l∈N0,q1+q2+l=j},
	

where (λ1,λ2)=(i⁢ω~,-i⁢ω~) and {e1,e2} is the canonical basis of C2. Hence,

	
Ker⁡(M21)=span⁡{(x1⁢μ

x2⁢μ)}
Ker⁡(M31)=span⁡{(x12⁢x2

From (3.2), (3.3) and (3.7), we get

	
f21⁢(x,0,μ)=Ψ⁢(0)⁢[2⁢L⁢(μ)⁢(Φ⁢x)+F2⁢(Φ⁢x,τ~)].
	

Thus, the second-order terms as described in (3.8) of the normal form on the centre manifold are given by

	12⁢g21⁢(x,0,μ)	=12⁢ProjKer⁡(M21)⁡f21⁢(x,0,μ)	
		=ProjKer⁡(M21)⁡Ψ⁢(0)⁢(L⁢(μ)⁢(ϕ1)⁢x1+L⁢(μ)⁢(ϕ2)⁢x2),	

where we have used (3.9) and (3.10). Note that L⁢(μ)=(μ/τ~)⁢L⁢(τ~). This, together with (3.4), yields that

	
12⁢g21⁢(x,0,μ)=(A1⁢x1⁢μ
A¯1⁢x2⁢μ),
	

with A1=i⁢ω⁢u⊤⁢v, for u and v defined as in (3.5). Next we will compute the third-order terms g31⁢(x,0,μ) as described in (3.8). We first note that

	g31⁢(x,0,μ)	=ProjKer⁡(M31)⁡f~31⁢(x,0,μ)	
		=ProjS⁡f~31⁢(x,0,0)+O⁢(|x|⁢μ2)

It is sufficient to compute only ProjS⁡f~31⁢(x,0,0) for the purpose of determining the generic Hopf bifurcation. In fact, f~3 denotes the third term after the computation of the normal form up to the second term, which is given by

	
f~31⁢(x,0,0)=f31⁢(x,0,0)+32⁢[(Dx⁢f21)⁢U21-(Dx⁢U21)⁢g21]⁢(x,0,0)+32⁢[(Dy⁢f21)⁢h]⁢(x,0,0),
	

where U21⁢(x,0)=(M21)-1⁢f21⁢(x,0,0) and h=h⁢(x)⁢(θ) is evaluated by the system

	
h˙⁢(x)-Dx⁢h⁢(x)⁢B⁢x=Φ⁢Ψ⁢(0)⁢[2⁢L⁢(0)⁢(Φ⁢x)+F2⁢(Φ⁢x,τ~)]
h˙⁢(x)⁢(0)-L⁢(τ~)⁢(h⁢(x))=2⁢L⁢(0)⁢(Φ⁢x)+F2⁢(Φ⁢x,τ~)
	

where h˙ denotes the derivative of h⁢(x)⁢(θ) with respective to θ. We first determine ProjS⁡[(Dx⁢f21)⁢U21]⁢(x,0,0). From (2.2), (3.2) and (3.7), we have

	
f21⁢(x,y,0)=τ~⁢(u1	u2

13⁢a¯02⁢x12+2⁢a¯11⁢x1⁢x2-a¯20⁢x22)	

which, together with (3.15), leads to

	
ProjS⁡[(Dx⁢f21)⁢U21]⁢(x,0,0)=(2⁢iω~⁢(a20⁢a11-2⁢|a11|2-13⁢|a02|2)⁢x12⁢x2
-2⁢iω~⁢(a¯20⁢a¯11-2⁢|a11|2-13⁢|a02|2)⁢x1⁢x22).
	

Next we compute ProjS⁡[(Dy⁢f21)⁢h]⁢(x,0,0), where h⁢(x), given by (3.13), is a second-order homogeneous polynomial in (x1,x2)∈C2 and coefficients in Ker π, as

	
h=(h(1)⁢(θ),h(2)⁢(θ))⊤=h20⁢(θ)⁢x12+h11⁢(θ)⁢x1⁢x2+h02⁢(θ)⁢x22.
	

With h written in this form, from (3.13) it is easy to verify that h02=h¯20. From (3.15), we then obtain

	
[(Dy⁢f21)⁢h]⁢(x,0,0)=2⁢τ¯⁢(E1⁢u1+E2⁢u2
E1⁢u¯1+E2⁢u¯2)
	

where

	E1=	(f101(1)⁢m10+f110(1)⁢l20)⁢h(1)⁢(0)+f101(1)⁢l10⁢h(1)⁢(-1)+f110(1)⁢l20⁢h(2)⁢(0)	
	E2=	(f200(2)⁢l10+f110(2)⁢l20+f101(2)⁢m20)⁢h(1)⁢(0)	
		+(f110(2)⁢l10+f011(2)⁢m20)⁢h(2)⁢(0)+(f101(2)⁢l10+f011(2)⁢l20)⁢h(2)⁢(-1)	

where with

	l10	=x1⁢v1+x2⁢v¯1,l20=x1⁢v2+x2⁢v¯2	
	m10	=x1⁢v1⁢e-i⁢ω~+x2⁢v¯1⁢ei⁢ω~,m2=x1⁢v2⁢e-i⁢ω~+x2⁢v¯2⁢ei⁢ω~	

Hence,

	
ProjS⁡[(Dy⁢f21)⁢h]⁢(x,0,0)=(2⁢a21*⁢x12⁢x2

C","3. Direction and stability of the Hopf bifurcation and τ=τ2,j+⁢(j=0,1,…). In this section, we will employ the algorithm and Magalhâes [9,10]) to compute explicitly the normal forms of system (1.3) on the center manifold. After that we 11 anay the direction of the Hopf bifurcation and stability of the bifurcating periodic orbits from the positive equilibrium E* of systen 2 at these critical values of τ. Without loss of generality, denote any one of these critical values τ=τ1,j±ap τ2,j+(j=0,1,...)byτ~ at which Eq. (2.2) has a pair of purely imaginary roots ±i⁢ω and system (1.3) undergoes a Ho difurcation from E*. Throughout this section, we refer to Faria and Magalháes [9,10] for explanations of notations invol d. We first rescale the time by t↦t/τ to normalize the delay o that (2.1)⁢ca be written as and

	
F⁢(φ,τ)=τ⁢(-a11⁢φ1⁢(0)⁢φ1⁢(-1)-a	p1⁢(0)⁢φ2
a21⁢φ1⁢(0)⁢φ2⁢(0)-a22	0)φ2()
	

The linear map L⁢(τ) may be expres d in thu egral form as

	
L⁢(τ)⁢ϕ=∫-10[d⁢ητ⁢(θ)]⁢ϕ⁢(θ),
	

where η:[-1,0]→R2×2 is a function of bo ted variation. Introducing the new para eter μ=τ-τ~ so chat μ=0 is a Hopf bifurcation value of (3.1), we can rewrite (3.1) as

	
z˙(t)=L(τ~)zt+F~,μ), 
	

where F~(zt,μ)=L(μ)zt-t+μ). Let ω~=ω⁢τ~ and Δ={iω^, ν~}. Fr 1 Lemma 2.3, we know that the characteristic equation of z˙⁢(t)=L⁢(τ~)⁢zt has a pair of simple imagina 00 the ω˙⁢ω~ ana ther roots in the imaginary axis which are multiples of ±i⁢ω~. Thus, the nonresonance conditions relat to Λ0 ratisfied. Let Φ=(ϕ1,ϕ2) be a matrix whose columns form a basis of the center space P of satisfies

	
L⁢(τ~)⁢ϕ1=i⁢ω~⁢v.
	

With C*=C⁢([0,1];R2⁣*), where R2⁣* is the two-dimensional space of row vectors, we consider the adjoint bilinear form on C*×C defined by

	
⟨ψ⁢(s),ϕ⁢(θ)⟩=ψ⁢(0)⁢ϕ⁢(0)-∫-10∫0θψ⁢(ξ-θ)⁢dητ~⁢(θ)⁢ϕ⁢(ξ)⁢dξ, for ⁢ψ∈C*,ϕ∈C.
	




964 S. Yuan, F. Zhang / Nonlinear Analysis: Real World Applications 11(2010) 959-977 Suppose Ψ=col⁡(ψ1,ψ2) is a matrix whose rows form a basis for the dual space P* in C* with ⟨Ψ(s),Φ(θ)⟩=I( the 2×2 identity matrix). Then we have Ψ⁢(s)=col⁡(ψ1⁢(s),ψ2⁢(s))=col⁡(uT⁢e-i⁢ω~⁢s,u¯T⁢ei⁢ω~⁢s),s∈[0,1], for u∈ℂ2 such that

	
⟨ψ1,ϕ1⟩=1,⟨ψ1,ϕ2⟩=0
	

By directly computing, we can choose v=(v1
v2)=(-i⁢ω+a11⁢x*⁢e-i⁢ω~a12⁢x*),u=(u1
u2)=d⁢(-i⁢ω+a22⁢y*⁢e-i⁢ω~a12⁢x*) where d=-a12⁢x*⁢ei⁢ω~2⁢i⁢ω⁢ei⁢ω~+(a11⁢x*+a22⁢y*)-τ~⁢[(a11⁢x*+a22⁢y*)⁢ω⁢i+2⁢a11⁢a22⁢x*⁢y*⁢e-i⁢ω~] such that ⟨𝑳⁢(s),Φ⁢(θ)⟩=I. Faria and Magalháes [9,10] show that (3.3) can be written as an infinite-dimensional or hary differen Banach space B⁢C of functions from [-1,0] into R2 which are uniformly continuous on [-1, and with a j] iscontinuity at 0 . Elements of B⁢C are of the form ϕ+X0⁢α where ϕ∈C,α∈R2 and X0⁢(θ) is defing by

	
X0⁢(θ)={1,	θ=0
0,	-r≤θ<0
	

Let π:B⁢C→P denote the projection π(φ+X0α)=Φ[⟨Ψ,φ⟩+Ψ ) α]. W ? writ B⁢C=P⊕ ker π with the property that Q⊂ker⁡π, where Q is an infinite-dimensional complemer ry subspace C. Let A be the infinitesimal generator for the flow of the linear system z˙⁢(t)=L⁢(τ~)⁢zt. Decompose zt, ) according to ne decomposition of B⁢C, in the form zt=Φ⁢x⁢(t)+yt, with x∈R2 and yt∈ker⁡π∩D⁢(A)=Q∩C1⁢Q1 who D⁢(A) is the domain of A. Define the 2×2 diagonal matrix

	
B=(i⁢ω~	0
0	-i⁢ω~)
	

Then Eq. (3.3) is equivalent to the following system

	
x˙=B⁢x+Ψ⁢(0)⁢F~⁢(Φ⁢x+y,μ)
dd⁢t⁢y=AQ1⁢y+(I-π)⁢X0⁢F~⁢(Φ⁢x+y,μ)
	

where AQ1:Q1→ker⁡π is such that AQ1ϕ=□ϕ˙(τ~)(ϕ-ϕ˙(0)] Let F~j be the j th Fréchet derivative of F~, deno dere then (3.6) can be written as

	
x˙=Bx+∑j≥21j!fj1 y,μ)
dd⁢ty=AQ1y+∑j!jy,μ)
	

where 1j!⁢fj1⁢(x,μ) and 1,μ) are homogeneous polynomials in (x,y,μ) of degree j with coefficients in ℂ2, ker π, respectively. ce the nonresonance conditions relative to Λ0 are satisfied, the normal form theory due to Magalháes [9,10, slies that the center manifold is locally given by y=0 and a normal form of (3.3) on this center manifold of the origh μ=0 is given by

	
x˙=B⁢x+12⁢g21⁢(x,0,μ)+13!⁢g31⁢(x,0,μ)+ h.o.t. 
	

where g21,g31 are the second- and third-order terms in (x,μ), respectively, and h.o.t. stands for higher-order terms.

S. Yuan, F. Zhang / Nonlinear Analysis: Real World Applications 11 (2010) 959-977 965 Let Vjm+p⁢(X) be the homogeneous polynomials of degree j in m+p real variables, x=(x1,…,xm),μ=(μ1,…,μp) with coefficients in X,

	
Vjm+p⁢(X)={∑|(q,l)|=jc(q,l)⁢xq⁢μl:c(q,l)∈X}  for ⁢(q,l)=(q1,…,qm,l1,…,lp)∈N0m+p
	

with the norm given by the sum of the norms of the coefficients. Define

	
(Mj1⁢p)⁢(x,μ)=Dx⁢p⁢(x,μ)⁢B⁢x-B⁢p⁢(x,μ),
	

where p⁢(x,μ)∈Vj2+1⁢(ℂ2). It follows from Faria and Magalháes [10] that

	
 and  Vj3⁢(ℂ2)=Im⁡(Mj1)⊕Ker⁡(Mj1),gj1⁢(x,0,μ)∈Ker⁡(Mj1),
	
	Ker⁡(Mj1)	=span{xqμlek:q1λ1+q2λ2=λk,k=1,2,q∈N02,l∈N0,q	
	where ⁢(λ1,λ2)	=(i⁢ω~,-i⁢ω~)⁢ and ⁢{e1,e2}⁢ is the canonical basis of ⁢ℂ2⁢. Hence,	
	Ker⁡(M21)	=span⁡{(x1⁢μ

x2⁢μ)},	
	Ker⁡(M31)	=span⁡{(x12⁢x2

0),(0
x1⁢x22),(0
x2⁢μ2)}.	

From (3.2), (3.3) and (3.7), we get

	
f21⁢(x,0,μ)=Ψ⁢(0)⁢[2⁢L⁢(μ)⁢(Φ⁢x)+F2⁢(Φ⁢x,τ~)].
	

Thus, the second-order terms as described in (3.8) of the normal amon the center manifold are given by with A1=i⁢ω⁢uT⁢v, for u and v defined as in (3 Next we will compute the third-order te ins g31⁢(x) described in (3.8). We first note that

	g31⁢(x,0,μ)	=ProjKer(M31⁡f~31⁢(x,0,μ)	
		=Projs⁡f~31⁢(x,0,0) O⁢(|x|⁢μ2)	

for

	
S=span⁡{(x12⁢x2

1⁢x22)}.
	

It is sufficient to compute nly Pro; 13⁢(x,0,0) for the purpose of determining the generic Hopf bifurcation. In fact f~3 denotes the third terms after the ’put ion of the normal form up to the second terms, which is given by

	
f~31(x,0,0)=0,0,22)2U21-(DxU21)g21](x,0,0)+32[(Dyf21)h](x,0,0),
	

where U21(x,Q′=(M21)-T2(x,0) and h=h⁢(x)⁢(θ) is evaluated by the system

	
h˙⁢(x)-Dx⁢h⁢(x)=Φ⁢Ψ⁢(0)⁢[2⁢L⁢(0)⁢(Φ⁢x)+F2⁢(Φ⁢x,τ~)],
h˙(x)(0)-L(τ~)(h=2L(0)(Φx)+F2(Φx,τ~),
	

where h˙ denotes the derivative of h⁢(x)⁢(θ) with respective to θ. From (3.11), it is clearly seen that

	
(Dx⁢U21)⁢g21⁢(x,0,0)=0.
	




966 S. Yuan, F. Zhang / Nonlinear Analysis: Real World Applications 11 (2010) 959-977 In addition, it follows from (3.2), (3.3) and (3.7) that f31=0. Thus, to compute Projsf~3(x,0,0)1, it is sufficient to determine Projs⁡[(Dx⁢f21)⁢U21]⁢(x,0,0) and Projs⁡[(Dy⁢f21)⁢h]⁢(x,0,0). We first determine Projs⁡[(Dx⁢f21)⁢U21]⁢(x,0,0). From (2.2), (3.2) and (3.7), we have

v¯22/y*). U21⁢(x,0)=(M21)-1⁢f21⁢(x,0,0) =1i⁢ω~⁢(b20⁢x12-2⁢b11⁢x1⁢x2-13⁢b02⁢x22

-2⁢iω~(b¯20b¯11-2∣b0-x1x22). This, together with (3.17), means

	
ProjS⁡[(Dx⁢f21)⁢U21]⁢(x,0,0)=(-2⁢i3⁢ω~∣b	x12⁢x2	
2⁢i3⁢π~∣b0	x12⁢x32	)
	

Next we compute ProjS⁢[(Dy⁢f21)⁢h′,0,0), who h⁢(x), given by (3.13), is a second-order homogeneous polynomial in (x1,x2)∈ℂ2 and coefficients in F as

	
h=(h(1)⁢(θ),h(2)⁢(θ))T=h20⁢(θ)⁢x1<⋅(θ)⁢x1⁢x2+h02⁢(θ)⁢x22.
	

This together with (3.13) ar (3.17),immediately leads to h02=h¯20 and h11=0. From (3.15), after computing, we get

	
[(Dy⁢f21)⁢h]⁢(x,0,0)=2⁢τ~⁢(E1	+E2⁢u2

m10=x1⁢v1⁢e-i⁢ω+y1⁢ei⁢ω~,m2=x1⁢v2⁢e-i⁢ω~+x2⁢v¯2⁢ei⁢ω~.
	

Hence,

	
ProjS⁡[(Dy⁢f21)⁢h]⁢(x,0,0)=(2⁢b21*⁢x12⁢x2

We are now in a position to compute ProjS⁡f~31⁢(x,0,0). Combining (3.12) with (3.17) and (3.20-3.22), we obtain

which can be written in real coordinates w through the change of variables x1=w1-i⁢w2 and x2= w1+i⁢w2. Transforming to polar coordinates w1=ρ⁢cos⁡ξ and w2=ρ⁢sin⁡ξ, this normal form becomes

with K1=Re⁡A1 and K2=Re⁡A2. It is well known that the sign of K1⁢K2 determines the direction of the bifurcation (supercritical if K1⁢K2<0 and subcritical if K1⁢K2>0 ) and the sign of K2 determines the stability of the non-trivial periodic orbits (stable if K2<0 and unstable if K2>0 ) (Chow & Hale, 1982). Thus, if system (1.3) is given, then we will analyse the direction of the Hopf bifurcation and stability of the bifurcating periodic orbits at τ=τ~. 4. Numerical examples To justify the theoretical analysis in Section 3, we give three examples: the first one concerns case (1) in Theorem 2.1 and another two concern cases 2(a) and 2(b) in Theorem 2.1, respectively.","early, we still need to compute h20⁢(θ).

From the above procedure, one can completely determine b21*⁢d2 ined as in (3.21). At the moment, we can compute ProjS⁡f~31⁢(x,0,0). Combinin (3.12) with (3 8) and (3.20), one can obtain

It is well know that the sim of K1⁢K2 deter nes the direction of the bifurcation (supercritical if K1⁢K2<0, subcritical if K1⁢K2>0 ), and the sign K2 determines the stability of the nontrivial periodic orbits (stable if K2<0, unstable if K2>0 ) [12].

THEOREM 5.1. The Ricci tensor of a non-degenerate hypersurface M with respect to the semi-symmetric non-metric connection is symmetric if and only if π is closed.

Proof. The Ricci tensor of a non-degenerate hypersurface M with respect to semi-symmetric non-metric connection is given by

	
Ric⁡(X,Y)=∑i=1nεi⁢g⁢(R⁢(Ei,X)⁢Y,Ei).
	




216 Ahmet Yücesan and Erol Yaşar 8 Using (16) in above equation of Ricci tensor, we have

	
Ric⁡(X,Y)=Ric∘⁡(X,Y)-(n-1)⁢α⁢(X,Y),
	

where Ric denotes the Ricci tensor of M with respect to the Levi-Civita connection. Since Ric is symmetric, we obtain

	
Ric⁡(X,Y)-Ric⁡(Y,X)=(n-1)⁢{α⁢(Y,X)-α⁢(X,Y)}=2⁢(n-1)⁢d⁢π⁢(Y,X)
	

which completes the proof. THEOREM 5.2. Let M be a non-degenerate hypersurface of a semi-Riemannian manifold M~. If  Ric ~ and Ric are the Ricci tensor of M~ and M with respect to the semi-symmetric non-metric connection, respectively, then for ∀X,Y∈χ⁢(M)

	
Ric~⁢(B⁢X,B⁢Y)=Ric⁡(X,Y)-ε⁢f⁢h⁢(X,Y)+
+h⁢(AN⁢X,Y)+ε⁢n⁢μ⁢h⁢(X,Y)+ε⁢g~⁢(R~⁢(N,B⁢X)⁢B⁢Y,N),
	

where if N is spacelike, ε=+1 or if N is timelike, ε=-1 and f=∑i=1nεi⁢h (Ei,Ei).

Proof. Suppose that {B⁢E1,…,B⁢Eν,B⁢Eν+1,…,B⁢En,N} is an orthonormal basis of χ⁢(M~). Then the Ricci curvature of M~ with respect to the semi-symmetric non-metric connection is (18) Ric~⁢(B⁢X,B⁢Y)=∑i=1nεi⁢g~⁢(R~⁢(B⁢Ei,B⁢X)⁢B⁢Y,B⁢Ei)+ε⁢g~⁢(R~⁢(N,B⁢X)⁢B⁢Y,N) for ∀X,Y∈χ⁢(M). By taking account of (18), (15), (13) and considering the symmetry of shape operator we get (17).

Theorem 5.3. Let M be non-degenerate hypersurface of a semi-Riemannian manifold M~. If ρ~ and ρ are the scalar curvatures of M~ and M with respect to the semi-symmetric non-metric connection, respectively, then

	
ρ~=ρ+f*+ε⁢(n⁢μ-f)⁢f+2⁢ε⁢Ric~⁢(N,N),
	

where f*=∑i=1nεi⁢h⁢(AN⁢Ei,Ei). Proof. Assume that {B⁢E1,…,B⁢Eν,B⁢Eν+1,…,B⁢En,N} is an orthonormal basis of χ⁢(M~). Then the scalar curvature of M~ with respect to the semisymmetric non-metric connection is

	
ρ~=∑i=1nεi⁢Ric~⁢(Ei,Ei)+ε⁢Ric~⁢(N,N).
	



9	Non-degenerate hypersurfaces with a semi-symmetric non-metric connection	217

By virtue of (17), (20), we obtain (19). We now assume that the 1 -form π is closed. In this case, we can define the sectional curvature for a section with respect to the semi-symmetric non metric connection (see [1]).

Suppose that the semi-symmetric non-metric connection ∇~ is of constant sectional curvature. Then R~⁢(X,Y)⁢Z should be of the form

	
R~⁢(X,Y)⁢Z=c⁢{g~⁢(Y,Z)⁢X-g~⁢(X,Z)⁢Y},
	

where c is a certain scalar. Thus, M~ is a semi-Riemannian manifold of constant curvature c with respect to the semi-symmetric non-metric connection, which we denote by M~⁢(c).

TheOrem 5.4. Let M be a non-degenerate hypersurface of a semi-Riemannian space form M~⁢(c) with a semi-symmetric non-metric connection. Then we get (22) Ric⁡(X,Y)=c⁢(n-1)⁢g⁢(X,Y)+ε⁢f⁢h⁢(X,Y)-h⁢(AN⁢X,Y)-ε⁢n⁢μ⁢h⁢(X,Y) for ∀X,Y∈χ⁢(M), where εi=g⁢(Ei,Ei),εi=1, if Ei is spacelike or εi=-1, if Ei is timelike, and f=∑i=1nεi⁢h⁢(Ei,Ei). Proof. Taking into account of (17) and (21), we have (22). From (22), the following corollaries can be stated: Corollary 5.5. Let M be a non-degenerate hypersurface of a semiRiemannian space form M~⁢(c) with a semi-symmetric non-metric connection. Then Ricci tensor of M is symmetric.

Corollary 5.6. Let M be a non-degenerate hypersurface of a semiRiemannian space form M~⁢(c) with a semi-symmetric non-metric connection. Then Ricci tensor of M is not parallel. 6. THE WEYL PROJECTIVE CURVATURE TENSOR OF A NON-DEGENERATE HYPERSURFACE WITH RESPECT TO A SEMI-SYMMETRIC NON-METRIC CONNECTION We denote the Weyl projective curvature tensor of the (n+1)-dimensional semi-Riemannian manifold M~ with respect to the Levi-Civita connection ∇~∘ by

	
P~∘(X~,Y~)Z~=R~∘(X~,Y~)Z~-1n{Ric∘(Y~,Z~)X~-Ric∘(X~,Z~)Y~},
	




218 Ahmet Yücesan and Erol Yaşar 10 ∀X~,Y~,Z~∈χ⁢(M~), where  Ric ∘ is Ricci tensor of M~ with respect to the LeviCivita connection ∇~∘ (see [10])

Analogous to (23), we define the Weyl projective curvature tensor of M~ with respect to the semi-symmetric non-metric connection as (24) P~⁢(X~,Y~)⁢Z~=R~⁢(X~,Y~)⁢Z~-1n⁢{Ric~⁢(Y~,Z~)⁢X~-Ric~⁢(X~,Z~)⁢Y~}, ∀X~,Y~,Z~∈χ⁢(M~), where  Ric ~ is the Ricci tensor M~ with respect to the connection ∇~. Thus, from (24), the Weyl projective curvature tensors with respect to the semi-symmetric non-metric connection ∇~ and induced connection ∇, respectively, are given by (25) P~⁢(X~,Y~,Z~,U~)=R~⁢(X~,Y~,Z~,U~)-1n⁢{Ric~⁢(Y~,Z~)⁢g~⁢(X~,U~)-Ric~⁢(X~,Z~)⁢g~⁢(Y~,U~)} and (26) P⁢(X,Y,Z,U)=R⁢(X,Y,Z,U)-1n-1⁢{Ric⁡(Y,Z)⁢g⁢(X,U)-Ric⁡(X,Z)⁢g⁢(Y,U)}, where for all X,Y,Z∈χ⁢(M),

	
P~⁢(X~,Y~,Z~,U~)=g~⁢(P~⁢(X~,Y~)⁢Z~,U~),P⁢(X,Y,Z,U)=g⁢(P⁢(X,Y)⁢Z,U)
	

and Ric is the Ricci tensor of M with respect to induced connection ∇. By using (25), we obtain (27) P~⁢(N,B⁢Y,B⁢Z,N)=R~⁢(N,B⁢Y,B⁢Z,N)-εn⁢Ric~⁢(B⁢Y,B⁢Z). Applying (17) in (27), we have

+f⁢ε⁢h⁢(Y,Z)-h⁢(AN⁢Y,Z)-μ⁢n⁢ε⁢h⁢(Y,Z).
	

Then, taking account of (26), (25), (28) and (15), we get

	P⁢(X,Y,Z,U)	=P~(BX,BY,BZ,BU)-ε{h(X,Z)h(Y,U)-h(Y,Z)h(X,U)

where Ric denotes the Ricci tensor of M with respect to the Levi-Civita connection and

	
α⁢(X,Y)=(∇X⁡π)⁢Y
	

From above it follows that

	Ric⁡(X,Y)-Ric⁡(Y,X)	=(n-1)⁢(α⁢(Y,X)-α⁢(X,Y))	
		=2⁢(n-1)⁢d⁢π⁢(Y,X)	

which completes the proof.

By virtue of (4.8), (4.11), we obtain (4.10). We now assume that the 1-form π is closed. Then we can define the sectional curvature for a section with respect to the semi-symmetric non-metric connection (see [1]).

Suppose that the semi-symmetric non-metric connection ∇~ is of constant sectional curvature, then R~⁢(X,Y)⁢Z should be of the form

From (4.13), the following corollary can be stated as: Corollary 13. Let M be a semi-Riemannian submanifold of a semi-Riemannian space form M~⁢(c) with a semi-symmetric non-metric connection.

Analogous to this definition, the Weyl projective curvature tensor of M~ with respect to the semi-symmetric non-metric connection can be defined as

for any X~,Y~,Z~∈χ⁢(M~), where  Ric ~ is the Ricci tensor M~ with respect to the connection ∇~. Thus, from (5.1), the Weyl projective curvature tensors with

"Abstract

We introduce and investigate a framework for constructing algorithms to invert Laplace transforms numerically. Given a Laplace transform f^ of a complex-valued function of a nonnegative real-variable, f, the function f is approximated by a finite linear combination of the transform values; i.e., we use the inversion formula

		f⁢(t)≈fn⁢(t)≡1t⁢∑k=0nωk⁢f^⁢(αkt),0<t<∞,	

where the weights ωk and nodes αk are complex numbers, which depend on n, but do not depend on the transform f^ or the time argument t. Many different algorithms can be put into this framework, because it remains to specify the weights and nodes. We examine three one-dimensional inversion routines in this framework: the Gaver-Stehfest algorithm, a version of the Fourier-series method with Euler summation, and a version of the Talbot algorithm, which is based on deforming the contour in the Bromwich inversion integral. We show that these three building blocks can be combined to produce different algorithms for numerically inverting two-dimensional Laplace transforms, again all depending on the single parameter n. We show that it can be advantageous to use different one-dimensional algorithms in the inner and outer loops.

5 Introduction

In recent years, numerical-transform inversion has become recognized as an important technique in operations research, notably for calculating probability distributions in stochastic models. There have now been many applications; e.g., see the survey by Abate et al. (1999) and the textbook treatment by Kao (1997).

Over the years, many different algorithms have been proposed for numerically inverting Laplace transforms; e.g., see the surveys in Abate and Whitt (1992) and Chapter 19 of Davies (2002), the extensive bibliography of Valko and Vojta (2001) and the numerical comparisons by Davies and Martin (1979), Narayanan and Beskos (1982) and Duffy (1993). In contrast to the usual approach, in this paper we do not focus on a particular procedure, but instead introduce and investigate a framework that can encompass a wide range of procedures. The flexible framework opens the way to further work, e.g., performing optimization in order to choose the best set of parameters and thus the best procedure, by various criteria, for various classes of functions. The flexible framework for numerically inverting one-dimensional Laplace transforms is also convenient for developing algorithms to invert multidimensional Laplace transforms. We can combine different one-dimensional inversion algorithms to obtain different multi-dimensional inversion algorithms. In particular, given three different onedimensional inversion algorithms, we directly obtain nine different two-dimensional inversion algorithms, one for each possible combination in the inner and outer loops. These one-dimensional algorithms can be combined with hardly any modifications, in some cases with none at all. Moreover, we show that it can be advantageous from the point of view of algorithm efficiency to combine two different one-dimensional inversion algorithms in the two-dimensional inversion algorithm.

The framework for one-dimensional inversion was originally introduced in several short papers by Zakian (1969, 1970, 1973), but it does not seem to have received much attention, if any. Moreover, in those papers, Zakian did not mention the advantage of having a flexible framework, encompassing several different procedures. Indeed, Zakian proposed a specific procedure, as we will explain in Section 2. The major contribution here, we believe, is suggesting the more general flexible framework, encompassing several different procedures, and showing how that can be exploited in multidimensional inversion algorithms.

To demonstrate the potential of our proposed flexible framework, we look at three specific widely used approaches in this framework, namely, (i) Fourier series expansions with Euler summation, (ii) combinations of Gaver functionals, and (iii) deformation of the contour in the Bromwich integral. These methods are well known as the Euler algorithm (the Fourier-series method with Euler summation), e.g., see Dubner and Abate (1968), Abate and Whitt (1992, 1995), Choudhury et al. (1994a), O’Cinneide (1997), Section 19.6 of Davies (2002), and Sakurai (2004); the Gaver-Stehfest algorithm, e.g., see Gaver (1966), Stehfest (1970), Section 8 of Abate and Whitt (1992), Section 19.2 of Davies (2002), and Valko and Abate (2004); and Talbot’s method, e.g., see Talbot (1979), Murli and Rizzardi (1990), Evans (1993), Evans and Chung (2000), Section 19.8 of Davies (2002), and Abate and Valko (2004).

Here is the idea: given a Laplace transform f^ of a complex-valued function f of a nonnegative realvariable,

	
f^⁢(s)≡∫0∞e-s⁢t⁢f⁢(t)⁢𝑑t,
	

the function f is represented approximately by a finite linear combination of the transform values, via

	
f⁢(t)≈fn⁢(t)≡1t⁢∑k=0nωk⁢f^⁢(αkt),t>0,
	

where the nodes αk and weights ωk (i.e., the interior and exterior scaling constants) are complex numbers, which depend on n, but not on the transform f^ or the time argument t. We assume that the Laplace transform f^⁢(s) in (1) is well defined and analytic for Re⁡(s)>0, where Re⁡(s) is the real part of the complex variable s≡u+i⁢v; i.e., Re⁡(s)=u for s=u+i⁢v with i=-1 and u and v real numbers. The associated imaginary part of s is Im⁡(s)=v. (We have assumed that the ""abscissa of convergence"" is less than or equal to 0 , which is natural for a large class of applications, but that can be generalized. Indeed, it is without loss of generality, because we can make a change of variables.)

Clearly, there are advantages to having the nodes αk and weights ωk in the representation of fn⁢(t) in (2) be independent of both the transform f^ and the time argument t. As a consequence, the procedure can be efficiently applied to multiple transforms and multiple time points. Of course, in general, the accuracy of the approximation will depend on the transform f^ and the time argument t, but there is the potential for great efficiency. Moreover, the same framework applies to multiple procedures as well, so that independent accuracy checks are readily available too.

In most applications, f will be real-valued; then we approximate by the real part, i.e.,

		Re⁡{f⁢(t)}≈Re⁡{fn⁢(t)}≡1t⁢∑k=0nRe⁡{ωk⁢f^⁢(αkt)}	
		=1t∑k=0n[Re{ωk}Re{f^(αkt)}	
		-Im{ωk}Im{f^(αkt)}].	

The case of complex-valued functions arises naturally when we consider inner loops in the inversion of multidimensional transforms; see Section 3.

For any given n, and any given set of approximating parameters {ωk,αk,1≤k≤n}, the function fn on the right in (2) serves as an approximation of the function f, which we intend to apply for all t that are continuity points of f with 0<t<∞. It is understood that there may be numerical difficulties if t is either very small or very large. In those exceptional cases it is often preferable to apply asymptotics as t→0 or t→∞, e.g., from the initial-value and final-value theorems (Doetsch 1974); e.g., as in Abate and Whitt (1997). Alternatively, it may be desirable to scale the function, as in Choudhury and Whitt (1997).

For any specific t, we can increase n in order to obtain better accuracy. However, greater system precision will typically be required to perform the calculation as n increases. As in Abate and Valko (2004), we suggest exploiting multi-precision software, which is now widely available through computer algebra systems such as Mathematica and Maple in order to obtain the required precision; e.g., see Graf (2004). Such high precision is also an integral part of UBASIC, which the first author has been using for more than twenty years.

In fact, in this paper we assume that multi-precision software is being used, so we do not consider special measures to control roundoff error within limited precision (e.g., standard double precision). The framework may also be useful with limited precision, provided appropriate measures are taken to control roundoff error, but some procedures, such as the Gaver-Stehfest algorithm, usually require high precision.

For one of the specific inversion routines we consider here (the Euler algorithm), the required precision as a function of n was identified on p. 272 of Abate et al. (1999). For the other two specific inversion routines we consider here, Abate and Valko (2004) identified the required precision as a function of n for a large class of transforms. (The full story is rather complicated; see Abate and Valko 2004 for more details.) Thus in our implementations of the three basic methods we obtain ""automatic algorithms"": given the accuracy we want for f⁢(t) (by which we mean relative accuracy, measured in significant digits; the number of significant digits is defined as -log10 (relative error); see (34)), a formula specifies the appropriate parameter n; then, given n, the program determines the required precision for the computation, using another formula, so that the desired accuracy for f⁢(t) is realized. Of course, if there are difficulties, then the parameter n or the system precision can be increased.

Different specific algorithms are obtained by introducing different families of approximating parameters {ωk,αk,0≤k≤n}. Indeed, Stehfest (1970) originally expressed the Gaver-Stehfest method in this form. We will cast the Fourier-series method with Euler summation and Talbot’s method in this form as well. It turns out that other methods also are already in this form. In particular, the Padé method used by Zakian (1969,1970) and Vlach (1969) and the Gaussian quadrature method of Piessens (1969,1971) and Wellekens (1970) are in this form, but we will not examine them in detail here.

On the other hand, there also are methods that are not, at least directly, in the form of (2). Among these is the popular Laguerre or Weeks method; e.g., see Abate et al. (1998) and Section 19.5 of Davies (2002). There we have

	
f⁢(t)≈∑i=0nci⁢li⁢(b⁢t),
	

where li⁢(t),i≥0, are the standard Laguerre functions, which form an orthonormal basis for the function space L2⁢([0,∞),𝐑), while the weights ci and the scale factor b depend on the transform f^.

A main purpose for the unified framework is to develop new algorithms for multidimensional transform inversion. So far, relatively little attention has been given to inversion of multidimensional Laplace transforms; e.g., see Choudhury et al. (1994a), Abate et al. (1998), Hwang and Lu (1999), and references therein. The Fourier-series multidimensional inversion routines in Choudhury et al. (1994a) have been applied to tackle challenging performance-analysis problems in the steady-state analysis of stochastic networks and the time-dependent analysis of queues with time-varying rates in Choudhury et al. (1994b, 1995a, b, 1997). Choudhury et al. (1997) includes an example of a 21-dimensional inversion.

It is significant that the simple framework in (2) extends easily to multidimensional transforms. For any two-dimensional transform f~⁢(s1,s2) of a twodimensional complex-valued function of nonnegative real variables, f⁢(t1,t2), the corresponding two-dimensional inversion formula is

	f⁢(t1,t2)	≈fn1,n2⁢(t1,t2)	
		≡1t1⁢t2⁢∑k1=0n1ωk1⁢∑k2=0n2ωk2′⁢f~⁢(αk1t1,αk2′t2),	

where n1 and n2 are the parameters, k1 and k2 are the indices, ωk1 and ωk2′ are the weights, and αk1 and αk2′ are the nodes for the outer and inner loops, respectively. We can calculate the approximant fn1,n2⁢(t1,t2) at any argument (t1,t2) provided that we can evaluate the double transform f~⁢(s1,s2) at any argument (s1,s2). As in (2) and (3), we use the real part if f⁢(t1,t2) is real-valued.

Given the three specific one-dimensional algorithms we consider in the framework (2), namely, Gaver (𝒮), Euler (∅), and Talbot (𝒯), we can combine them in every possible combination to obtain nine two-dimensional algorithms. In particular, it is not necessary to use the same routine in both the inner and outer loop. Indeed, we will show that it can be advantageous to combine two different one-dimensional routines. We are unaware of this ever having been done before.

In this paper, we examine these nine two-dimensional algorithms, using the notation 𝒢⁢𝒯, where the first operator 𝒢 applies to the outer loop, while the second operator 𝒯 applies to the inner loop. We discuss the performance of these two-dimensional routines, illustrating with numerical examples.

Here is how the rest of this paper is organized: we start in Section 2 by explaining the unified framework. Then in Section 3 we elaborate on the extension of the framework to two dimensions. In the next three sections we introduce specific algorithms in the framework. In Sections 4,5 , and 6 we briefly specify our versions of the one-dimensional Gaver-Stehfest, Fourier-series (with Euler summation), and Talbot algorithms in the unified framework. Then in Section 7 we discuss the performance of these one-dimensional algorithms. In Section 8 we show how the three one-dimensional inversion algorithms can be combined to produce specific two-dimensional algorithms. In Section 9 we present numerical examples evaluating the performance of the two-dimensional inversion algorithms. In Section 10 we draw conclusions.

6 The Unified Framework

In this section we provide motivation for the general inversion formula (2), explaining how it was originally derived. We present two derivations: first, one based on the Bromwich inversion integral due to Wellekens (1970) and, second, the original one based on approximating delta functions due to Zakian (1969, 1970, 1973). However, we will not use those specific inversion routines later in the paper. We start by observing that it is natural to have t-1 appear both inside and outside the transform f^ in the inversion formula for f⁢(t) in (2).

Initial-Value and Final-Value Theorems

One way to see the role of t-1 is to consider appropriate Abelian and Tauberian theorems, in particular, the familiar initial-value and final-value theorems; e.g., see Bingham et al. (1987), Doetsch (1974), or Feller (1971). In simple form, the initial-value theorem states that, when the two limits both exist,

	
limt↓0⁡f⁢(t)=limt↓0⁡1t⁢f^⁢(1t),
	

while the final-value theorem states that, when the two limits both exist,

	
limt↑∞⁡f⁢(t)=limt↑∞⁡1t⁢f^⁢(1t).
	

Moreover, other refined asymptotics agree when the transform is scaled in that way, e.g., see Heavyside’s theorem, Theorem 37.1 of Doetsch (1974).

7 Starting from the Bromwich Inversion Integral

We now start to review Wellekens’ (1970) argument, which begins with the Bromwich inversion integral. Since the Euler and Talbot algorithms also can be derived from the Bromwich inversion integral, this argument explains why they too fit in the framework (2).

Suppose that f is a real-valued function of a nonnegative real variable, which is continuous at t. The Bromwich inversion integral expresses f⁢(t) as the contour integral

	
f⁢(t)=12⁢π⁢i⁢∫Cf^⁢(s)⁢es⁢t⁢𝑑s,t>0,
	

where the contour C extends from c-i⁢∞ to c+i⁢∞ for c>0, falling to the right of all singularities of f^, under the usual regularity conditions; see Theorem 24.4 of Doetsch (1974).

Following Wellekens (1970), we make the change of variables z= st and rewrite the contour integral as

	
f⁢(t)=12⁢π⁢i⁢t⁢∫C′f^⁢(z/t)⁢ez⁢𝑑z,t>0,
	

where C′ is the same contour as a function of z. By that step alone, we see how t-1 appears both in the multiplicative constant and the argument of the transform f^. Indeed, almost any method of numerical integration (approximate quadrature) applied to the integral in (9) produces the representation (2); see Davis and Rabinowitz (1984).

8 Rational Approximations for the Exponential
9 Function

To achieve the unified framework in (2) from (9), Wellekens (1970) approximated the exponential function ez in the integrand of (9) by a rational function. Indeed, both of the earlier approaches exploit rational approximations for the exponential function, so we digress to discuss that intermediate step now.

Writing the rational function in a partial-fraction representation (e.g., see p. 76 of Doetsch 1974), we have

	
ez≈∑k=0nωkαk-z,
	

where z is a complex variable and αk and ωk are complex numbers.

We will impose regularity conditions on the complex numbers αk and ωk appearing in (10): First, we will assume that the parameters αk are distinct, implying that the rational approximant in (10) has n+1 poles. We will require that the approximant be analytic for Re⁡(z)>0. Consequently, we assume that Re⁡(αk)<0 for all k. We also assume that the pairs of complex numbers (αk,ωk) occur in complex-conjugate pairs. (If s≡u+i⁢v, then its complex conjugate is s¯≡ u-iv.) That is, if either αk or ωk has a non-zero imaginary part, then we also have the pair (α¯k,ω¯k) among the n terms in the sum (10). Since

	
ωkαk-z+ω¯kα¯k-z
	

is real for all real z, that condition guarantees that the approximating rational function is real-valued for all real z. Consequently, we can alternatively express (10) as

	
ez≈12⁢∑k=0n[ωkαk-z+ω¯kα¯k-z],
	

where Re⁡(αk)<0 for all k.

Of course, we want to choose the rational function in (10) or (11) so that we obtain a good approximation. A classic way to do that is to choose the complex numbers αk and ωk so as to match the MacLaurin series of the two functions as far as possible. That procedure is effective; indeed, that procedure is the classical method of Padé approximation; moreover, the exponential function was one of the first functions to be treated; see the Preface and Section 1.2 of Baker and Graves-Morris (1996). It should thus not be surprising that Zakian (1969, 1970, 1973) and Wellekens (1970) exploited Padé approximation when they approximated the exponential function, but of course there are many other possible rational approximations for the exponential function, with merits depending on the context.

10 The Rest of Wellekens’ Argument

Continuing to follow Wellekens (1970), we achieve the unified framework in (2) from (9) by approximating the exponential function ez in the integrand of (9) by a rational function, using (10) or (11). For example, using (10), we get

using the Cauchy integral formula in the last step, e.g., p. 9 of Davies (2002).

It still remains to choose the specific rational approximation for the exponential function. Wellekens (1970) shows that the classic Padé approximation arises when we perform Gaussian quadrature to the integral (9). Thus there is additional justification for Padé approximation.

11 Zakian’s Original Argument

Zakian originally obtained (2) in a very different way, in particular, by approximating a delta function by a finite linear combination of exponential functions. Let δ⁢((x/t)-1) be the scaled delta function that attaches mass t to the point t, for each t>0; i.e., it satisfies the properties

	
∫0Tδ⁢((x/t)-1)⁢𝑑x=t	 and ⁢δ⁢((x/t)-1)=0
	 for ⁢x≠t,0<t<T.
	

More precisely, if f is an integrable complex-valued function of a nonnegative real variable that is continuous at t, then

	
f⁢(t)=1t⁢∫0Tf⁢(x)⁢δ⁢((x/t)-1)⁢𝑑x,0<t<T.
	

Note that δ actually is a function of two variables, x and t.

The idea, then, is to approximate the scaled delta function δ⁢((x/t)-1) by a finite linear combination of exponential functions; i.e.,

	
δ⁢((x/t)-1)≈δn⁢((x/t)-1)≡∑k=0nωk⁢e-αk⁢x/t,
	

where αk and ωk are complex numbers. It may not be immediately clear that this is a good thing to do, but we explain later.

Now we consider an integrable function f that we want to evaluate, again assumed to be a complexvalued function of a nonnegative real variable. For each continuity point t of f, we approximate f⁢(t) by the associated integrals with respect to δn⁢(x/t-1); i.e., combining (14) and (15), we use the approximation

	f⁢(t)	≈fn⁢(t)≡1t⁢∫0Tf⁢(x)⁢δn⁢((x/t)-1)⁢𝑑x,0<t<T	
		=1t⁢∫0Tf⁢(x)⁢∑k=0nωk⁢e-αk⁢x/t⁢d⁢x	
		=1t⁢∑k=0nωk⁢∫0Tf⁢(x)⁢e-αk⁢x/t⁢𝑑x	
		→1t⁢∑k=0nωk⁢∫0∞f⁢(x)⁢e-αk⁢x/t⁢𝑑x	
		=1t⁢∑k=0nωk⁢f^⁢(αkt)	

where we let T→∞ in the last step, with the limit being justified by standard assumptions on f guaranteeing that the Laplace transform is well defined. We see that (16) is of the same form as (2).

The linearity in formula (2) implies that the inversion can be applied either to the complex-valued function f or to its real and imaginary parts: Suppose that f is a complex-valued function and let f(1)≡Re⁡(f) and f(2)≡Im⁡(f) be the real and imaginary parts of f. Then

	
f⁢(t)=f(1)⁢(t)+i⁢f(2)⁢(t),f^⁢(s)=f^(1)⁢(s)+i⁢f^(2)⁢(s)
	

and

	fn⁢(t)	≡1t⁢∑k=0nωk⁢f^⁢(αkt)	
		=1t⁢∑k=0nωk⁢[f^(1)⁢(αkt)+i⁢f^(2)⁢(αkt)]	
		=1t⁢∑k=0nωk⁢f^(1)⁢(αkt)+i⁢1t⁢∑k=0nωk⁢f^(2)⁢(αkt)	
		=1t⁢∑k=0nRe⁡{ωk⁢f^(1)⁢(αkt)}+i⁢1t⁢∑k=0nRe⁡{ωk⁢f^(2)⁢(αkt)}	
		≡fn(1)⁢(t)+i⁢fn(2)⁢(t).	

It remains to show that the approximants δn in (15) can indeed serve as good approximants for the scaled delta function δ. At first, it may not be obvious that the delta function admits a reasonable approximation of the form (15). Indeed, it is obvious that the approximation δn cannot be a good approximation for the delta function δ uniformly in the neighborhood of its discontinuity, since the approximant is a continuous function, but nevertheless we can hope to approximate f⁢(t) at points t that are continuity points of f. As Zakian (1970) observed, the possibility of good approximations is evident if we take Laplace transforms: The Laplace transform of the scaled delta function is

	
δ^⁢(s,t)≡∫0∞e-s⁢x⁢δ⁢((x/t)-1)⁢𝑑x=t⁢e-t⁢s,
	

while the Laplace transform of the general nth approximant is

	
δ^n⁢(s,t)≡∫0∞e-s⁢x⁢δn⁢((x/t)-1)⁢𝑑x=∑k=0nωks+(αk/t).
	

Assuming that the nodes αk are distinct for 0≤k≤n, we see that the Laplace transform of the approximant is a proper rational function with poles at αk/t, expressed in a partial-fraction representation with partial fraction coefficients ωk.

At this point we exploit uniqueness and continuity theorems for Laplace transforms, e.g., see Doetsch (1974) and Chapter 13 of Feller (1971), to justify characterizing functions and measures in terms of Laplace transforms. Thus, assuming that we can work with Laplace transforms, in order to approximate the scaled delta function δ⁢((x/t)-1) by its approximant δn⁢((x/t)-1) in (15), it suffices to approximate the exponential function t⁢e-t⁢s in (19) by the rational functions in (20). As observed by Zakian (1970), that problem is the well-studied problem of Padé approximation.","ABSTRACT We introduce and investigate a framework for constructing algorithms to numerically invert Laplace transforms. Given a Laplace transform f^ of a complex-valued function of a nonnegative real-variable, f, the function f is approximated by a nite linear combination of the transform values; i.e., we use the inversion formula

	
f⁢(t)≈fn⁢(t)≡1t⁢∑k=0nωk⁢f^⁢(αkt),0<t<∞,
	

where the weights □k and nodes □k are complex numbers, which depend on n, but do not depend on the transform f^ or the time argument t. Many different algorithms can be put into this framework, because it remains to specify the weights and nodes. We examine three one-dimensional inversion routines in this framework: the Gaver-Stehfest algorithm, a version of the Fourier-series method with Euler summation, and a version of the Talbot algorithm, which is based on deforming the contour in the Bromwich inversion integral. We show that these three building blocks can be combined to produce different algorithms for numerically inverting two-dimensional Laplace transforms, again all depending on the single parameter n. We show that it can be advantageous to use different one-dimensional algorithms in the inner and outer loops. Keywords : Laplace transforms; numerical transform inversion; Fourier-series method; Talbot’s method; Gaver-Stehfest algorithm; multi-precision computing; multidimensional Laplace transforms; multidimensional transform inversion. 1. Introduction In recent years, numerical transform inversion has become recognized as an important technique in operations research, notably for calculating probability distributions in stochastic models. There have now been many applications; e.g., see the survey by Abate et al. (1999) and the textbook treatment by Kao (1997).

Over the years, many different algorithms have been proposed for numerically inverting Laplace transforms; e.g., see the surveys in Abate and Whitt (1992) and Chapter 19 of Davies (2002), the extensive bibliography of Valko and Vojta (2001) and the numerical comparisons by Davies and Martin (1979), Narayanan and Beskos (1982) and Duffy (1993). In contrast to the usual approach, in this paper we do not focus on a particular procedure, but instead introduce and investigate a framework that can encompass a wide range of procedures. The flexible framework opens the way to further work, e.g., performing optimization in order to choose the best set of parameters and thus the best procedure, by various criteria, for various classes of functions. 673

Shobha Lal & Rajesh Saxena The flexible framework for numerically inverting one-dimensional Laplace transforms is also convenient for developing algorithms to invert multi-dimensional Laplace transforms. We can combine different one-dimensional inversion algorithms to obtain different multi-dimensional inversion algorithms. In particular, given three different one-dimensional inversion algorithms, we directly obtain nine different two-dimensional inversion algorithms, one for each possible combination in the inner and outer loops. These one-dimensional algorithms can be combined with hardly any modifications, in some cases with none at all. Moreover, we show that it can be advantageous from the point of view of algorithm ciency to combine two different one-dimensional inversion algorithms in the twodimensional inversion algorithm.

The framework for one-dimensional inversion was originally introduced in several short papers by Zakian (1969,1970,1973), but it does not seem to have received much attention, if any. Moreover, in those papers, Zakian did not mention the advantage of having a flexible framework, encompassing several different procedures. Indeed, Zakian proposed a specific procedure, as we will explain in Section 2. The major contribution here, we believe, is suggesting the more general flexible framework, encompassing several different procedures, and showing how that can be exploited in multidimensional inversion algorithms. To demonstrate the potential of our proposed flexible framework, we look at three specific widely used approaches in this framework, namely, (i) Fourier series expansions with Euler summation, (ii) combinations of Gaver functionals and (iii) deformation of the contour in the Bromwich integral. These methods are well known as the Euler algorithm (the Fourier-series method with Euler summation), e.g., see Dubner and Abate (1968), Abate and Whitt (1992, 1995), Choudhury, Lucantoni and Whitt (1994a), O’Cinneide (1997), Section 19.6 of Davies (2002) and Sakurai (2004); the Gaver-Stehfest algorithm; e.g., see Gaver (1966), Stehfest (1970), Section 8 of Abate and Whitt (1992), Section 19.2 of Davies (2002) and Valko and Abate (2004); and Talbot’s method, e.g., see Talbot (1979), Murli and Rizzardi (1990), Evans (1993), Evans and Chung (2000), Section 19.8 of Davies (2002) and Abate and Valko (2004).

Here is the idea: Given a Laplace transform f^ of a complex-valued function f of a nonnegative real-variable,

	
f^⁢(s)=∫0∞e-s⁢t⁢f⁢(t)⁢𝑑t,
	

the function f is represented approximately by a finite linear combination of the transform values, via

	
f⁢(t)≈fn⁢(t)=1t⁢∑k=0nωk⁢f^⁢(αkt),t>0
	

where the nodes αk and weights ωk (i.e., the interior and exterior scaling constants) are complex numbers, which depend on n, but not on the transform f^ or the time argument t. We assume that the Laplace transform f^⁢(S) in (1) is well defined and analytic for Re⁡(s)>0, where Re⁡(s) is the real part of the complex variable s≡u+i⁢v; i.e., Re⁡(s)=u for s=u+i⁢v with i=-1 and u and v real numbers. The associated imaginary part of s is Im⁡(s)=v. (We have assumed that the labscissa of convergence” is less than or equal to 0 , which is natural for a large class of applications, but that can be generalized. Indeed, it is without loss of generality, because we can make a change of variables.)

Clearly, there are advantages to having the nodes αk and weights ωk in the representation of fn⁢(t) in (2) be independent of both the transform f^ and the time argument t. As a consequence, the procedure can be efficiently applied to multiple transforms and multiple time points. Of course, in general, the accuracy of the approximation will depend on the transform f^ and the time argument t, but there is the potential for great efficiency. Moreover, the same framework applies to multiple procedures as well, so that independent accuracy checks are readily available too. 674

BROMWICH INVERSIONI INTEGRAL IN CONTEXT… In most applications, f will be real-valued; then we approximate by the real part, i.e., Re⁡[f⁢(t)]≈Re⁡[fn⁢(t)]≡1t⁢∑k=0nRe⁡{ωk⁢f^⁢(αkt)}

	
=1t⁢∑k=0n[Re⁡(ωk)⁢Re⁡{f^⁢(αkt)}-Im⁡(ωk)⁢Im⁡{f^⁢(αkt)}]
	

The case of complex-valued functions arises naturally when we consider inner loops in the inversion of multidimensional transforms; see Section 3. For any given n, and any given set of approximating parameters {ωk,αk,1≤k≤n}, the function fn on the right in (2) serves as an approximation of the function f, which we intend to apply for all t that are continuity points of f with 0<t<∞. It is understood that there may be numerical difficulties if t is either very small or very large. In those exceptional cases it is often preferable to apply asymptotics as t→0 or t→∞, e.g., from the initial-value and final-value theorems (Doetsch 1974); e.g., as in Abate and Whitt (1997). Alternatively, it may be desirable to scale the function, as in Choudhury and Whitt (1997). For any specific t, we can increase n in order to obtain better accuracy. However, greater system precision will typically be required to perform the calculation as n increases. As in Abate and Valko (2004), we suggest exploiting multi-precision software, which is now widely available through computer algebra systems such as Mathematica and Maple in order to obtain the required precision; e.g, see Graf (2004). Such high precision is also an integral part of UBASIC, which the second author has been using for more than twenty years.

In fact, in this paper we assume that multi-precision software is being used, so we do not consider special measures to control roundoff error within limited precision (e.g., standard double precision). The framework may also be useful with limited precision, provided appropriate measures are taken to control roundoff error, but some procedures, such as the Gaver-Stehfest algorithm, usually require high precision.

For one of the specific inversion routines we consider here (the Euler algorithm), the required precision as a function of n was identified on p. 272 of Abate, Choudhury and Whitt (1999). For the other two specific inversion routines we consider here, Abate and Valko (2004) identified the required precision as a function of n for a large class of transforms. (The full story is rather complicated; see Abate and Valko (2004) for more details.) Thus in our implementations of the three basic methods we obtainlautomatic algorithms”: Given the accuracy we want for f⁢(t) (by which we mean relative accuracy, measured in significant digits; the number of significant digits is defined as -log10 (relative error); see (34)), a formula specifies the appropriate parameter n; then, given n, the program determines the required precision for the computation, using another formula, so that the desired accuracy for f⁢(t) is realized. Of course, if there are difficulties, then the parameter n and/or the system precision can be increased.

Different specific algorithms are obtained by introducing different families of approximating parameters {ωk,αk,0≤k≤n}. Indeed, Stehfest (1970) originally expressed the Gaver-Stehfest method in this form. We will cast the Fourier-series method with Euler summation and Talbot’s method in this form as well. It turns out that other methods also are already in this form. In particular, the Pade method used by Zakian (1969,1970) and Vlach (1969) and the Gaussian quadrature method of Piessens (1969,1971) and Wellekens (1970) are in this form, but we will not examine them in detail here.

On the other hand, there also are methods that are not, at least directly, in the form of (2). Among these is the popular Laguerre or Weeks method; e.g., see Abate, Choudhury and Whitt (1998) and Section 19.5 of Davies (2002). There we have

	
f⁢(t)≈∑i=0nci⁢li⁢(bt)
	

675

Shobha Lal & Rajesh Saxena where 1i⁢(t),i≥0, are the standard Laguerre functions, which form an orthonormal basis for the function space L2⁢([0,∞),R) L2([0;1);R), while the weights ci and the scale factor b depend on the transform f^

A main purpose for the unified framework is to develop new algorithms for multidimensional transform inversion. So far, relatively little attention has been given to inversion of multidimensional Laplace transforms; e.g., see Choudhury et al. (1994a), Abate et al. (1998), Hwang and Lu (1999) and references therein. The Fourier-series multidimensional inversion routines in Choudhury et a. (1994) have been applied to tackle challenging performance-analysis problems in the steady-state analysis of stochastic networks and the time-dependent analysis of queues with time-varying rates in Choudhury et al. (1995a,b), and Choudhury et al. (1994b, 1997). Choudhury et al. (1997) includes an example of a 21-dimensional inversion.

It is significant that the simple framework in (2) extends easily to multidimensional transforms. For any two-dimensional transform f~⁢(s1,s2) of a two-dimensional complex-valued function of nonnegative real variables, f⁢(t1,t2), the corresponding two-dimensional inversion formula is

	f⁢(t1,t2)	≈fn1,n2⁢(t1,t2)	
		≡1t1⁢t2⁢∑k1=0n1ω⁢k1⁢∑k2=0n2ω′⁢k2⁢f~⁢(α⁢k1t1,αk2′t2)	

where n1 and n2 are the parameters, k1 and k2 are the indices, ωk1 and ω′⁢k2 are the weights and αk1 and αk2′ are the nodes for the outer and inner loops, respectively. We can calculate the approximant fn1,n2⁢(t1,t2) at any argument (t1,t2) provided that we can evaluate the double transform f⁢(s1,s2) at any argument (s1,s2). As in (2) and (3), we use the real part if f⁢(t1,t2) is realvalued.

Given the three specific one-dimensional algorithms we consider in the framework (2), namely, Gaver (G), Euler (E) and Talbot (T), we can combine them in every possible combination to obtain nine two-dimensional algorithms. In particular, it is not necessary to use the same routine in both the inner and outer loop. Indeed, we will show that it can be advantageous to combine two different one-dimensional routines. We are unaware of this ever having been done before.

In this paper, we examine these nine two-dimensional algorithms, using the notation GT , where the first operator G applies to the outer loop, while the second operator T applies to the inner loop. We discuss the performance of these two-dimensional routines, illustrating with numerical examples.

Here is how the rest of this paper is organized: We start in Section 2 by explaining the unified framework. Then in Section 3 we elaborate on the extension of the framework to two dimensions. In the next three sections we introduce specific algorithms in the framework. In Sections 4,5 and 6 we briefly specify our versions of the one-dimensional Gaver-Stehfest, Fourier-series (with Euler summation) and Talbot algorithms in the unified framework. Then in Section 7 we discuss the performance of these one-dimensional algorithms. In Section 8 we show how the three onedimensional inversion algorithms can be combined to produce specific two-dimensional algorithms. In Section 9 we present numerical examples evaluating the performance of the two-dimensional inversion algorithms. In Section 10 we draw conclusions. 2. The Unified concept In this section we provide motivation for the general inversion formula (2), explaining how it was originally derived. We present two derivations: first, one based on the Bromwich inversion integral due to Wellekens (1970) and, second, the original one based on approximating delta functions due to 676

BROMWICH INVERSIONI INTEGRAL IN CONTEXT… Zakian (1969, 1970, 1973). However, we will not use those specific inversion routines later in the paper. We start by observing that it is natural to have t-1 appear both inside and outside the transform f^ in the inversion formula for f⁢(t) in (2). An Extension of Final-Value Theorems One way to see the role of t-1 is to consider appropriate Abelian and Tauberian theorems, in particular, the familiar initial-value and final-value theorems; e.g., see Bingham et al. (1987), Doetsch (1974) or Feller (1971). In simple form, the initial-value theorem states that, when the two limits both exist,

	
limt,0⁡f⁢(t)=limt,0⁡1t⁢f^⁢(1t)
	

while the final-value theorem states that, when the two limits both exist,

	
limt↑0⁡f⁢(t)=limt↑0⁡1t⁢f^⁢(1t)
	

Moreover, other refined asymptotics agree when the transform is scaled in that way, e.g., see Heavyside’s theorem, Theorem 37.1 of Doetsch (1974). Starting from the Bromwich Inversion Integral We now start to review Wellekens’ (1970) argument, which begins with the Bromwich inversion integral. Since the Euler and Talbot algorithms also can be derived from the Bromwich inversion integral, this argument explains why they too fit in the framework (2).

Suppose that f is a real-valued function of a nonnegative real variable, which is continuous at t. The Bromwich inversion integral expresses f⁢(t) as the contour integral

	
f⁢(t)=12⁢π⁢i⁢∫Cf^⁢(s)⁢est⁢ds,t>0
	

where the contour C extends from c-i⁢∞ to c+i⁢∞ for c>0, falling to the right of all singularities of f^, under the usual regularity conditions; see Theorem 24.4 of Doetsch (1974).

Following Wellekens (1970), we make the change of variables z= st and rewrite the contour integral as

	
f⁢(t)=12⁢π⁢it⁢∫C′f^⁢(z/t)⁢ez⁢dz,t>0
	

where C0 is the same contour as a function of z. By that step alone, we see how t-1 appears both in the multiplicative constant and the argument of the transform f^. Indeed, almost any method of numerical integration (approximate quadrature) applied to the integral in (9) produces the representation (2); see Davis and Rabinowitz (1984). The relationship does not only hold asymptotically for small and large t. Real Approximations for the Exponential Function To achieve the unified framework in (2) from (9), Wellekens (1970) approximated the exponential function ez in the integrand of (9) by a rational function. Indeed, both the earlier approaches exploit rational approximations for the exponential function, so we digress to discuss that intermediate step now.

Writing the rational function in a partial-fraction representation (e.g., see p. 76 of Doetsch 1974), we have

	
ez≈∑k=0nωkαk-z′
	

where z is a complex variable and αk and ωk are complex numbers. 677

Shobha Lal & Rajesh Saxena We will impose regularity conditions on the complex numbers αk and ωk appearing in (10) : First, we will assume that the parameters αk are distinct, implying that the rational approximant in (10) has n+1 poles. We will require that the approximate be analytic for Re⁡(z)>0. Consequently, we assume that Re⁡(αk)<0 for all k. We also assume that the pairs of complex numbers (αk,ωk) occur in complex-conjugate pairs. (If S≡u+iv, then its complex conjugate is S¯≡u-iV.) That is, if either αk or ωk has non-zero imaginary part, then we also have the pair (α¯k,ω¯k) among the n terms in the sum (10). Since

	
ωkαk-z+ω¯kα¯k-z
	

is real for all real z, that condition guarantees that the approximating rational function is real valued for all real z. Consequently, we can alternatively express (10) as

	
ez≈12⁢∑k=0n[ωkαk-z+ω¯kαk-z¯]
	

where Re⁡(αk)<0 for all k Of course, we want to choose the rational function in (10) or (11) so that we obtain a good approximation. A classic way to do that is to choose the complex numbers αk and ωk so as to match the MacLaurin series of the two functions as far as possible. That procedure is effective; indeed, that procedure is the classical method of Pade approximation; see Baker and Graves-Morris (1996); moreover, the exponential function was one of the first functions to be treated; see the Preface and Section 1.2. It should thus not be surprising that Zakian (1969,1970,1973) and Wellekens (1970) exploited Pade approximation when they approximated the exponential function, but of course there are many other possible rational approximations for the exponential function, with merits depending on the context. Algorithm of Wellekens’ Argument Continuing to follow Wellekens (1970), we achieve the unified framework in (2) from (9) by approximating the exponential function ez in the integrand of (9) by a rational function, using (10) or (11). For example, using (10), we get

	
fn⁢(t)≈12⁢π⁢it⁢∫C′f^⁢(z/t)⁢∑k=0nωαk
=1t⁢∑k=0n12⁢π⁢i⁢∫C′f^⁢(z/t)⁢∑k=0nωkαk-z
=1t⁢∑k=0n12⁢π⁢i⁢ωk⁢f^⁢(αkt),t>0
	

using the Cauchy integral formula in the last step, e.g., p. 9 of Davies (2002). It still remains to choose the specific rational approximation for the exponential function. Wellekens (1970) shows that the classic Pade approximation arises when we perform Gaussian quadrature to the integral (9). Thus there is additional justification for Pade approximation. Zakian’s Original Argument Zakian originally obtained (2) in a very different way, in particular, by approximating a delta function by a finite linear combination of exponential functions. Let □⁢((x=t)-1) be the scaled delta function that attaches mass t to the point t, for each t>0; i.e., it satisfies the properties 678

BROMWICH INVERSIONI INTEGRAL IN CONTEXT…

	
∫0Tδ⁢((x/t)-1)⁢dx=t  and  δ⁢((x/t)-1)=0
 for ⁢x≠t,0<t<T
	

More precisely, if f is an integrable complex-valued function of a nonnegative real variable that is continuous at t, then

	
f⁢(t)=1t⁢∫0Tf⁢(x)⁢δ⁢((x/t)-1)⁢𝑑x,0<t<T
	

Note that δ actually is a function of two variables, x and t. The idea, then, is to approximate the scaled delta function δ⁢((x/t)-1) by a finite linear combination of exponential functions; i.e.,

	
δ⁢((x/t)-1)≈δn⁢δ⁢((x/t)-1)≡∑k=0nωk⁢e-αk⁢x/t
	

where αk and ωk are complex numbers. It may not be immediately clear that this is a good thing to do, but we explain later.

Now we consider an integrable function f that we want to evaluate, again assumed to be a complex valued function of a nonnegative real variable. For each continuity point t of f, we approximate f⁢(t) by the associated integrals with respect to δn⁢(X/t-1); i.e. combining (14) and (15), we use the approximation

	f⁢(t)≈fn⁢(t)≡	1t⁢∫0Tf⁢(x)⁢δn⁢((x/t)-1)⁢dx,0	
		=1t⁢∫0Tf⁢(x)⁢∑k=0nωk⁢e-αk⁢x/t⁢dx	
		=1t⁢∑k=0nωk⁢∫0Tf⁢(x)⁢e-αk⁢x/t⁢dx	
		→1t⁢∑k=0nωk⁢∫0∞f⁢(x)⁢e-αk⁢x/t⁢dx	
		=1t⁢∑k=0nωk⁢f^⁢(αkt)	

where we let T→∞ in the last step, with the limit being justified by standard assumptions on f guaranteeing that the Laplace transform is well defined. We see that (16) is of the same form as (2). The linearly in formula (2) implies that the inversion can be applied either to the complexvalued function f or to its real and imaginary parts : Suppose that f is a complex-valued function and let f(1)≡Re⁡(f) and f(2)≡Im⁡(f) be the real and imaginary parts of f. Then

	
f⁢(t)=f(1)⁢(t)+if(2)⁢(t),f^⁢(s)=f^(1)⁢(s)+i⁢f^(2)⁢(s)
	

and

	fn⁢(t)	≡1t⁢∑k=0nωk⁢f^⁢(αkt)	
		=1t⁢∑k=0nωk⁢[f^(1)⁢(αkt)+i⁢f^(2)⁢(αkt)]

It remains to show that the approximants δn in (15) can indeed serve as good approximants for the scaled delta function δ. At first, it may not be obvious that the delta function admits a reasonable approximation of the form (15). Indeed, it is obvious that the approximation δn cannot be a good approximation for the delta function δ uniformly in the neighborhood of its discontinuity, since the approximant is a continuous function, but nevertheless we can hope to approximate f⁢(t) at points t that are continuity points of f.

As Zakian (1970) observed, the possibility of good approximations is evident if we take Laplace transforms. The Laplace transform of the scaled delta function is

	
δ^⁢(s,t)≡∫0∞e-sx⁢δ⁢((x/t)-1)⁢dx=te-ts
	

while the Laplace transform of the general nth approximant is

	
δ^n⁢(s,t)≡∫0∞e-s⁢x⁢δn⁢((x/t)-1)⁢𝑑x=∑k=0nωks+(αk/t)

BROMWICH INVERSIONI INTEGRAL IN CONTEXT… Assuming that the nodes αk are distinct for 0≤k≤n, we see that the Laplace transform of the approximant is a proper rational function with poles at αk/t, expressed in a partial-fraction representation with partial fraction coefficients ωk.

At this point we exploit uniqueness and continuity theorems for Laplace transforms, e.g. see Doetsch (1974) and Chapter 13 of Feller (1971), to justify characterizing functions and measures in terms of Laplace transforms. Thus, assuming that we can work with Laplace transforms, in order to approximate the scaled delta function δ⁢((x/t)-1) by its approximant δn⁢((x/t)-1) in (15), it suffices to approximate the exponential function t⁢e-ts in (19) by the rational functions in (20). As observed by Zakian (1970), that problem is the well-studied problem of Pade approximation.",1241.65114.tex,1266.65214.tex,Variation of subject; Errors; Insertions; Paraphrase

20 Candidate Two-Dimensional Algorithms

In this section we combine the three one-dimensional inversion algorithms 𝒢,ℰ, and 𝒯 specified in Sections 4,5 , and 6 to construct nine two-dimensional inversion algorithms. In each case, the two-dimensional inversion routine can be expressed in the common form (26), but in some cases further simplification can be obtained by exploiting properties of complex conjugates. We display the possible algorithms below in Table 5.

In Table 5 we use the notation in Sections 4-6. In particular, we use the single parameter M instead of n. The outer loop has parameter M and the inner loop has parameter c⁢M, so there remains only the single parameter M.

We also use the special notation for the nodes and weights introduced in Sections 4-6. Thus, ζk are the Gaver weights in (32), ηk and βk are the Euler weights and nodes in (37) and (38), and γk and δk are the Talbot weights and nodes in (43).

It is understood that the weights and nodes in the outer loop depend on the parameter M, while the weights and nodes in the inner loop depend on the parameter c⁢M, where c is specified at the left, based on our experience with a collection of good transforms (the class 𝐅 from Abate and Valko 2004).

Table 5 The Nine Two-Dimensional Inversion Routines Based on the Three One-Dimensional Routines: Gaver-Stehfest 𝒢, Euler ℰ, and Talbot 𝒯

Notes. The value of c has been specified based on experience with good transforms. The routines are ordered according to the number of transform evaluations required. A prime appears on the nodes and weights in the inner loop in the three cases in which c≠1, indicating that these parameters depend on c⁢M, not M. When c≠1, which occurs in only three cases, the corresponding parameters in the inner loop are designated by the addition of a ’ (prime). For example, with the all-Gaver routine 𝒢⁢(M)⁢𝒢⁢(2⁢M),ζk depends on M, while ζk′ depends on 2⁢M. Similarly, in 𝒢⁢(M)⁢ℰ⁢(3⁢M),ζk again depends on M, but ηk′ and βk′ depend on 3⁢M. However, much to our surprise, in six of the nine twodimensional algorithms we found that it suffices to let c=1, making the number of computations in the inner loop no greater than in the outer loop.

The four algorithms combining ℰ and 𝒯 exploit relations involving complex conjugates, so there is an extra term in each sum, with the entire quantity divided by 2 .

21 Performance of the
22 Two-Dimensional Algorithms

In this section we describe the performance of the two-dimensional inversion routines. Paralleling Table 1 , in Table 6 we analyze the efficiency of the nine routines specified in Section 8. We order the algorithms according to the approximate number of transform evaluations required, because that seems to be the decisive factor. The algorithms at the top, requiring fewer transform evaluations, tend to be most efficient.

Now we consider two concrete examples in detail, both taken from Ditken and Prudnikov (1962). Both are good transforms (in the class 𝐅 in Abate and Valko 2004). (We have examined about ten examples from Ditken and Prudnikov (1962); these two are representative. We also have conducted experiments on queueing transforms. Applications to queues will be discussed in Abate and Whitt 2005.) The first example here is the two-dimensional Laplace transform

Note. The routines have been ordered according to the approximate number of required transform evaluations. The asterisks indicate values that have been multiplied by two because there is a second evaluation involving the complex conjugate.

with inverse function

	
f⁢(t1,t2)=2π⁢[t12+t22-t2]1/2.
	

Numerical results for this first example are given in Table 7. We consider all nine methods in Table 5.

The execution time reflects the number of transform evaluations, but it also reflects the required precision setting. For example, 𝒯⁢𝒢 and 𝒯 require about the same number of transform evaluations, 2⁢M2, but the execution time for 𝒯⁢𝒢 is higher because the precision setting is higher. The precision setting is 2.2⁢M for 𝒯⁢𝒢, but only M for 𝒯⁢𝒯. In contrast, ℰ⁢𝒯 and 𝒯⁢ℰ have both the same number of evaluations, 4⁢M2, and the same precision setting, so that the overall execution time is consistently about the same. On the other hand, 𝒯⁢𝒯 and ℰ⁢𝒯 have the same precision setting, but 𝒯⁢𝒯 evaluates half as many terms as ℰ⁢ℱ; accordingly, the execution time for 𝒯⁢𝒯 is about half that for ℰ⁢𝒯.

Our second example is the two-dimensional Laplace transform

	
f^⁢(s1,s2)=exp⁡(1/s2⁢(s1+1))s2⁢s1+1
	

with inverse function

	
f⁢(t1,t2)=e-t1π⁢t1⁢I0⁢([8⁢t1⁢t2]1/2)⁢，
	

where I0 is the modified Bessel function; see p. 66 of Magnus et al. (1966). Numerical results for this second example are given in Table 8.

From Tables 7 and 8, we conclude that the algorithms in the upper part of the tables, requiring fewer transform evaluations, are most efficient. Rough generalizations would be: (1) it is not so good to use the Gaver-Stehfest routine in the outer loop and (2) the Talbot routine tends to be efficient wherever it is used. Table 8 A Comparison of the Performance of Nine Two-Dimensional Inversion Routines as a Function of M for the Transform in (52) with Inverse Function in (53)

Note. The execution time is in seconds on a 0.2⁢GHzCPU.

However, there is a difficulty with the Talbot algorithm, which does not have to do with efficiency. It is caused by the fact that the Talbot routine involves both complex weights and complex nodes. We found that we sometimes encountered difficulties evaluating transform values when the Talbot algorithm was used in the inner loop. That is because of difficulties in the software (e.g., Mathematica) properly evaluating complex-valued functions of two complex variables, e.g., involving the square-root function.

Thus, at this time, we would not recommend using the Talbot algorithm in the inner loop, or at least being aware that there might be problems involving computation with complex numbers and functions. That leaves 𝒯⁢𝒢,ℰ⁢𝒢, and 𝒯⁢ℰ as the top-ranked two-dimensional routines. None of these uses the same one-dimensional routine in both loops. However, all nine methods are effective. Overall, our study indicates the unified framework has promise.

23 Conclusions

In this paper we have proposed the general unified framework in (2) for numerically inverting Laplace transforms. We pointed out that the flexible framework makes it possible to perform optimization in order to select specific inversion routines for special classes of functions, but it remains to pursue that approach. In Sections 4, 5, and 6 we showed that the Gaver-Stehfest method, 9, the Fourier-series method with Euler summation, ℰ, and a version of Talbot’s method, 𝒯, all fit into this common framework.

In Section 3 we observed that the unified framework extends directly to yield a corresponding framework for numerically inverting multidimensional Laplace transforms. In Section 8 we observed that the three specific one-dimensional algorithms we introduced in the framework (2) produce nine candidate two-dimensional algorithms, all in the twodimensional framework (5). In Sections 7 and 9 we reported results on the performance of the algorithms. In Section 7 we concluded that the Euler and Talbot one-dimensional algorithms are about equally efficient, as measured by the ratio of the number of significant digits produced to the number of digits of machine precision required, while these two are about 1.5 times as efficient as the Gaver-Stehfest one-dimensional algorithm. However, the Gaver-Stehfest algorithm has the advantage of working with only real numbers.

Investigations of the two-dimensional algorithms in Section 9 indicate that all nine combinations of the three one-dimensional routines can be effective twodimensional algorithms. However, we encountered difficulties calculating values of two-dimensional transforms when the Talbot method 𝒯 is used in the inner loop, because of problems evaluating transforms for conjugate s. Initial results indicate that the best two-dimensional algorithms are the combinations 𝒯⁢𝒢,ℰ⁢𝒢 and 𝒯⁢ℰ. Evidently it can be advantageous to use different one-dimensional routines in the inner and outer loops.

Much remains to be done. First, as is often the case with numerical transform inversion (and many other numerical methods), a systematic error analysis is lacking. The bounds for the Fourier-series method with Euler summation in Abate and Whitt (1995), O’Cinneide (1997), and Sakurai (2004) are the exception. There is a need for much more testing. It remains to understand better how the algorithms perform on different classes of transforms. More work is needed, extending Abate and Valko (2004), to understand how the algorithm performance depends on the structure of the transform. It remains to see what combinations of the three one-dimensional routines will be especially effective for high-dimensional inversion problems.

It also remains to consider other kinds of transforms. We have found that essentially the same unified framework applies to generating functions; we plan to elaborate on that elsewhere. Thus, just as in Choudhury et al. (1994a), the unified framework will apply to multidimensional transforms, where each dimension may involve either a generating function or a Laplace transform.","Table 4 : Significant digits produced by the One-Dimensional Talbot Algorithm as a Function of t and M for the Example in (48) and (49).

1760 A. Taleshian and S. M. Mirghasemi open subset U⊂X, we say that the triple (f,g,U) is admissible if the set of coincidence of f and g in U is compact. In particular, this will be true provided that U has compact closure and no coincidence on its topological boundary. Let C⁢(X,Y) be the set of all admissible triples of maps from X to Y. If ft,gt:X×[0,1]→Y are homotopies and U⊂X is an open subset, we say that the pair (ft,gt) is a pair of admissible homotopies in U if

y′⁢(t)=A⁢y⁢(t)+B⁢u⁢(t),t>0,y⁢(0)=y0.
	

In this paper, we are interested in the stabilizability of system (1.1) by controls of finite dimension when {(A,D⁢(A))⁢ is the infinitesimal generator of a strongly continuous analytic semigroup on ⁢Y,
 the resolvent of ⁢A⁢ is compact in ⁢Y and B is an unbounded operator from U into Y satisfying either

or an assumption stronger than (1.3), namely

	
(λ0⁢I-A)α-1⁢B∈ℒ⁢(U,Y),0<α≤1⁢, for some ⁢λ0>0.
	

Let (et⁢A)t≥0 be the semigroup on Y generated by (A,D⁢(A)). By the so-called extrapolation method, (et⁢A)t≥0 can be extended to a strongly continuous analytic semigroup on (D⁢(A*))′, still denoted by (et⁢A) tz0 to simplify the notation. Thus, for every y0∈Y and every u∈Lloc 2([0,∞); U), the unique solution y to equation (1.1) is defined by the formula

268 J.-P. Raymond, Stabilizability of Infinite Dimensional Systems by Finite Dimensional Control DE GRUYTER From [12, Theorem 2.1, Chapter 3, Part I] it follows that the function y in (1.5) belongs to

	
C⁢([0,∞);(D⁢(A*))′)∩Lloc2⁢([0,∞);Y).
	

By controls of finite dimension we mean controls u of the form

	
u⁢(t)=∑i=1Nfi⁢(t)⁢wi,
	

with wi∈U and fi⁢(t)∈ℝ. By introducing 𝔹∈ℒ⁢(ℝN,(D⁢(A*))′) defined by

	
𝔹⁢f=∑i=1Nfi⁢B⁢wi, with ⁢f=(f1,…,fN)∈ℝN,
	

equation (1.1) with controls of the form (1.6) may be rewritten as

	
y′⁢(t)=A⁢y⁢(t)+𝔹⁢f⁢(t),t>0,y⁢(0)=y0.
	

To study the stabilizability of system (1.1), it is interesting to introduce the associated complexified system. For that, we set

	
𝐘=Y+i⁢Y,
	

and we shall write in ’boldface’ functions taking values in ℂ. With this notation convention, the complexified system associated with (1.1) is written in the form

	
𝐲′⁢(t)=A⁢𝐲⁢(t)+B⁢𝐮⁢(t),t>0,𝐲⁢(0)=𝐲0.
	

In (1.8), we look for stabilizing controls 𝐮 belonging to L2⁢(0,∞;𝐔), where 𝐔=U+i⁢U is the complexified space associated with U, and (A,D⁢(A)) is considered as the unbounded operator in the complexified space 𝐘. As usual, A⁢𝐲⁢(t) and B⁢𝐮⁢(t) are respectively defined by

	
A⁢𝐲⁢(t)=A⁢Re⁡(𝐲⁢(t))+i⁢A⁢Im⁡(𝐲⁢(t))⁢ and ⁢B⁢𝐮⁢(t)=B⁢Re⁡(𝐮⁢(t))+i⁢B⁢Im⁡(𝐮⁢(t))⁢. 
	

To define the complexified system associated with (1.7), we can either complexify the control variable f=(f1,…,fN) or complexify both the control variable f=(f1,…,fN) and the actuators (w1,…,wN). We choose this second option. Thus we first introduce complex-valued actuators by setting

	
𝐖=spanℂ⁡{𝐰1,…,𝐰Nc}, where ⁢{𝐰1,…,𝐰Nc}⊂𝐔⁢, 
	

and we next introduce the real-valued actuators associated to 𝐖 by setting

	
W=spanℝ⁡{w1,…,wN}=spanℝ⁡{Re⁡𝐰j,Im⁡𝐰j∣1≤j≤Nc}⊂U.
	

With this choice, the complexified system associated with (1.7) is

	
𝐲′⁢(t)=A⁢𝐲⁢(t)+𝔹ℂ⁢𝐟⁢(t),t>0,𝐲⁢(0)=𝐲0,
	

where

	
𝔹ℂ⁢𝐟=∑j=1Nc𝐟j⁢B⁢𝐰j⁢ for all ⁢𝐟=(𝐟1,…,𝐟Nc)∈ℂNc.
	

Since there are different notions of stabilizability, we now state the precise definitions that we are going to consider. We start with the so-called open loop stabilizability, or equivalently the Finite Cost Condition. Definition 1.1. We say that the pair (A,B) satisfies the so-called ”Finite Cost Condition in Y (FCC in Y for short) with controls in U and with the prescribed exponential decay rate ω≥0 ” when, for any y0∈Y, there exists uy0∈L2⁢(0,∞;U) such that t↦eω⁢t⁢uy0⁢(t)∈L2⁢(0,∞;U) and the solution yy0,uy0 to system (1.1), asso-

∫0∞∥eω⁢t⁢𝐲𝐲0,𝐮𝐲0⁢(t)∥𝐘2⁢𝑑t<∞.
	

The FCC in Y (resp. in 𝐘 ) for the pair (A,B) with controls in W (resp. in W) is expressed in terms of an FCC for the pair (A,𝔹) (resp. the pair (A,𝔹ℂ)).

We say that the pair (A,B) satisfies the ”FCC in Y with controls in ℝN and with the prescribed exponential decay rate ω≥0 ” when, for any y0∈Y, there exists fy0∈L2⁢(0,∞;ℝN) such that

	
t↦eω⁢t⁢fy0⁢(t)∈L2⁢(0,∞;ℝN)
	

and the solution yy0,fy0 to system (1.7), associated with the control fy0, obeys

	
∫0∞∥eω⁢t⁢yy0,fy0⁢(t)∥Y2⁢𝑑t<∞.
	

We say that the pair (A,𝔹ℂ) satisfies the ”FCC in Y with controls in ℂNc and with the prescribed exponential decay rate ω≥0 ” when, for any 𝐲0∈𝐘, there exists 𝐟y0∈L2⁢(0,∞;ℂNc) such that

	
t↦eω⁢t⁢𝐟y0⁢(t)∈L2⁢(0,∞;ℂNc)
	

and the solution 𝐲𝐲0,𝐟𝐲0 to system (1.9), associated with the control 𝐟𝐲0, obeys

	
∫0∞∥eω⁢t⁢𝐲𝐲0,𝐟𝐲0⁢(t)∥𝐘2⁢𝑑t<∞.
	

We now state the definitions of closed loop stabilizability and stabilizability by feedback. Definition 1.2. We say that the pair (A,B) is stabilizable by feedback in Y, with the prescribed exponential decay rate ω≥0, when there exists an operator K∈ℒ⁢(Y,U) such that A+ω⁢I+B⁢K, with domain D⁢(A+ω⁢I+B⁢K)={y∈Y∣(A+B⁢K)⁢y∈Y}, is the infinitesimal generator of a strongly continuous exponentially stable semigroup on Y.

We say that the pair (A,B) is stabilizable by feedback in 𝐘, with the prescribed exponential decay rate ω≥0, when there exists an operator K∈ℒ⁢(𝐘,𝐔) such that A+ω⁢I+B⁢K, with domain

	
D⁢(A+ω⁢I+B⁢K)={𝐲∈𝐘∣(A+B⁢K)⁢𝐲∈𝐘},
	

is the infinitesimal generator of a strongly continuous exponentially stable semigroup on 𝐘. We say that the pair (A,B) is stabilizable by feedback in Y, with the prescribed exponential decay rate ω≥0, when there exists an operator 𝕂∈ℒ⁢(Y,ℝNc) such that A+ω⁢I+𝔹⁢K, with domain

	
D⁢(A+ω⁢I+𝔹⁢𝕂)={y∈Y∣(A+𝔹⁢K)⁢y∈Y},
	

is the infinitesimal generator of a strongly continuous exponentially stable semigroup on Y. We say that the pair (A,𝔹ℂ) is stabilizable by feedback in 𝐘, with the prescribed exponential decay rate ω≥0, when there exists an operator 𝕂∈ℒ⁢(𝐘,ℂNc) such that A+ω⁢I+𝔹ℂ⁢𝕂, with domain

	
D⁢(A+ω⁢I+𝔹ℂ⁢𝕂)={𝐲∈𝐘∣(A+𝔹ℂ⁢𝕂)⁢y∈𝐘},
	

is the infinitesimal generator of a strongly continuous exponentially stable semigroup on 𝐘.

270 - J.-P. Raymond, Stabilizability of Infinite Dimensional Systems by Finite Dimensional Control DE GRUYTER Let us first recall some known results from the literature. The stabilizability of system (1.1) when B∈ℒ⁢(U,Y) has been studied by many authors in the 1970 s. We mention [11,33] and we refer to the survey by Pritchard and Zabzyck [28]. When A is the infinitesimal generator of an analytic semigroup with a compact resolvent, stabilizability results may also be deduced from approximate controllability results stated in [14,15].

To summarize these contributions to the stabilizability issue, we refer to [12, Proposition 3.3, Chapter 1 , Part III]. The precise statement is the following.

Proposition 1.3. Assume that B∈ℒ⁢(U,Y) (or B∈ℒ⁢(𝐔,𝐘) ). Let σ⁢(A) be the spectrum of A and let us introduce σs⁢(A)={λ∈σ⁢(A)∣Re⁡(λ)<0},σ0⁢(A)={λ∈σ⁢(A)∣Re⁡(λ)=0} and σu⁢(A)={λ∈σ⁢(A)∣Re⁡(λ)>0}. Assume that σ0⁢(A)∪σu⁢(A) consists of a finite set of eigenvalues of finite multiplicity, and that

supλ∈σs⁢(A)⁡Re⁡(λ)⁢<-δ⁢ and ∥⁢et⁢A⁢(I-Πu)∥ℒ⁢(Y)≤Cs⁢e-δ⁢t  for all ⁢t≥0,
	

where Πu is the projector defined by

	
Πu=12⁢i⁢π⁢∫γ0,u(λ⁢I-A)-1⁢𝑑λ,
	

and y0,u is a single Jordan curve surrounding σ0⁢(A)∪σu⁢(A) and no other element of σ⁢(A), described counterclockwise. Then the following statements are equivalent: (a) The pair (A,B) is stabilizable with respect to I. (b) For all λ∈σ0⁢(A)∪σu⁢(A), one has Ker⁡(λ¯⁢I-A*)∩Ker⁡(B*)={0}. In [12], the definition of ”the pair (A,B) is stabilizable with respect to I ” corresponds to ”the pair (A,B) satisfies the FCC in Y with controls in U and with the prescribed exponential decay rate ω=0 ”.

For real-valued systems, A and A* have the same eigenvalues and λ¯ in Ker⁡(λ¯⁢I-A*), condition (b) may be replaced by λ. This is what is stated in [12, Proposition 3.3, Chapter 1, Part III].

Notice that (1.10) holds true when assumption (1.2) is satisfied. Condition (b) in Proposition 1.3 is known as the Hautus criterion for stabilizability. Since for bounded control operators the FCC is equivalent to the stabilizability by feedback, Proposition 1.3 shows that the Hautus criterion is equivalent to the FCC in Y (resp. Y) with controls in U (resp. U), but also to the stabilizability by feedback.

In this paper, we would like to see if, when assumption (1.3) or (1.4) is satisfied, the Hautus criterion is equivalent or not to the FCC in Y with controls in U, to the FCC condition in Y with controls in W for some specific space W, and to the stabilizability by feedback.

There is a class of unbounded control operators B, called admissible operators for the semigroup (et⁢A)t≥0 on Y. A control operator B∈ℒ⁢(U,(D⁢(A*))′) is an admissible operator for the semigroup (et⁢A)t≥0 on Y when, for every u∈Lloc 2([0,∞); U ) and every y0∈Y, the solution to y to equation (1.1) belongs to C([0,∞);Y ) (see [34, Definition 4.2.1]). By using the Duhamel formula (1.5) and the Young inequality for convolution products, if assumption (1.4) is satisfied for some 12<α≤1, then the operator B is admissible for (et⁢A)t≥0 in Y. In that case, it can be shown that the Hautus criterion is equivalent to the stabilizability by feedback (see Theorem 1.6 below).

There are several contributions to the feedback stabilization of system (1.1) when assumptions (1.2) and (1.4) are satisfied. For parabolic equations with Neumann, Fourier or Dirichlet boundary conditions, we refer to [2,21-23,26] and the references therein. In particular, in [23, Theorem 2.2.1] it is proved that under assumptions (1.2) and (1.4) the FCC in Y with controls in U of the pair (A,B) is equivalent to the stabilizability by feedback (see a more detailed comparison at the end of this section). Some results on the feedback stabilization for finite dimensional controls may also be found in [2, 21, 22, 26].

Despite the many contributions in the literature, we are not informed of stabilizability results by finite dimensional controls in the case when B obeys assumption (1.3) or (1.4), similar to the one stated in Proposition 1.3, except in the case when σ⁢(A) is semi-simple (see, e.g., [10] in the case of the boundary control of the linearized Navier-Stokes equations) and except two recent contributions by Badra and Takahashi [7,8].

DE GRUYTER J.-P. Raymond, Stabilizability of Infinite Dimensional Systems by Finite Dimensional Control -271 In order to state the main result of the paper, we have to precisely define the space of actuators W. We do it now. Under assumption (1.2), for ω≥0 given, there is a finite number of eigenvalues (λj)1≤j≤Nu of the operator A with real part greater than or equal to -ω. Without loss of generality, we can assume that we are in the following situation:

	
⋯≤Re⁡λNu+1<-ω≤Re⁡λNu≤Re⁡λNu-1≤⋯≤Re⁡λ1.
	

We denote by E⁢(λj)=Ker⁡(λj⁢I-A) the eigenspace of A associated with λj and by E*⁢(λ¯j)=Ker⁡(λ¯j⁢I-A*) the eigenspace of A* associated with λ¯j. The space Re⁡E⁢(λj) (resp. ImE(λj)) denotes the real vector space generated by the real parts (resp. the imaginary parts) of vectors belonging to E⁢(λj). Similar definitions can be set out for Re⁡E*⁢(λ¯j) and Im⁡E*⁢(λ¯j). Throughout what follows, we set

	
W=spanℝ⁡(⋃j=1Nu(Re⁡B*⁢E*⁢(λ¯j)∪Im⁡B*⁢E*⁢(λ¯j)))
	

and

	
𝐖=spanℂ⁢⋃j=1NuB*⁢E*⁢(λ¯j).
	

Our main goal is to prove the following stabilizability result. Theorem 1.4. Assume that assumptions (1.2) and (1.3) are satisfied and that (λj)1≤j≤Nu is the family of eigenvalues of the operator A satisfying (1.11). Then the following conditions are equivalent: (i) The pair (A,B) satisfies the FCC in Y with controls in U and with the prescribed exponential decay rate ω≥0. (ii) The pair (A,B) satisfies the FCC in 𝐘 with controls in 𝐔 and with the prescribed exponential decay rate ω≥0. (iii) The pair (A,𝔹) satisfies the FCC in Y with controls ℝN and with the prescribed exponential decay rate ω≥0. (iv) The pair (A,𝔹ℂ) satisfies the FCC in 𝐘 with controls ℂNc and with the prescribed exponential decay rate ω≥0. (v) For all 1≤j≤Nu, one has Ker⁡(λ¯j⁢I-A*)∩Ker⁡(B*)={0}. (vi) The pair (A,𝔹) is stabilizable by feedback in (D⁢(A*))′ with the prescribed exponential decay rate ω≥0. (vii) The pair (A,𝔹ℂ) is stabilizable by feedback in (D⁢(A*))′ with the prescribed exponential decay rate ω≥0. (viii) The pair (A,B) is stabilizable by feedback in (D⁢(A*))′ with the prescribed exponential decay rate ω≥0. (This statement is valid both for the real system and the associated complexified system.) We state below two Hautus criteria equivalent to the Hautus criterion stated in (v) in the theorem above. Proposition 1.5. Assume that assumptions (1.2) and (1.3) are satisfied and that (λj)1≤j≤Nu is the family of eigenvalues of the operator A satisfying (1.11). Then the following conditions are equivalent: (v) For all 1≤j≤Nu, one has Ker⁡(λ¯j⁢I-A*)∩Ker⁡(B*)={0}. (ix) For all 1≤j≤Nu, one has Ker⁡(λ¯j⁢I-A*)∩Ker⁡(𝔹*)={0}. (x) For all 1≤j≤Nu, one has Ker⁡(λ¯j⁢I-A*)∩Ker⁡(𝔹ℂ*)={0}. Let us complete the theorem above by stating a short result on the stabilizability by feedback in Y. Theorem 1.6. Assume that the assumptions of Theorem 1.4 are fulfilled and that in addition assumption (1.4) is satisfied. Then conditions (i)-(x) of Theorem 1.4 and Proposition 1.5 are equivalent to the following one: (xi) The pair (A,𝔹)( resp. (A,𝔹ℂ)) is stabilizable by feedback in Y( resp. Y ) with the prescribed exponential decay rate ω≥0.

Comparison with results in [23]. Theorems 1.4 and 1.6 may be compared with some statements in [23, Theorem 2.2.1]. In [23, Theorem 2.2.1], the pair (A,B) is assumed to satisfy (1.2) and (1.4). The FCC in Y is assumed and the link between the FCC in Y with the Hautus criterion is not made in [23]. It rather refers to specific properties of parabolic equations (see the Section Verification of the FCC in [23, p. 173]).

272 J.-P. Raymond, Stabilizability of Infinite Dimensional Systems by Finite Dimensional Control DE GRUYTER In [23, Theorem 2.2.1], the stabilizability by feedback in Y is proved via the theory of Riccati equations. A uniqueness result for the Riccati equations is proved under a detectability condition satisfied by (A,C), where C is the observation operator involved in the Riccati equation. Here, in order to construct a feedback, contrarily to [23], we do not use an infinite dimensional Riccati equation but a Riccati equation stated in a finite dimensional space. This approach is well adapted to numerical approximation as shown in [1]. Thus it seems that Theorem 1.4 is the first one in which the FCC is shown to be equivalent to the Hautus criterion for unbounded control operators in the case of parabolic systems.

Comparison with results in [7, 8]. In [8, Theorem 3.5], Badra and Takahashi state a stabilizability result by feedback when the pair (A,B) satisfies (1.2) and (1.4). It is stated there that the Hautus criterion is equivalent to the stabilizability by feedback. The stabilizability of the pair (A,B), that is, the feedback stabilization by finite dimension controls, is also considered in [8, Theorem 3.5], but not for an explicit finite dimensional control space as in Theorem 1.6, even if [8, Remark 3.7] provides some indications for that. Let us mention that no result is stated in [7,8] when only assumptions (1.2) and (1.3) are satisfied. 2 Stabilizability of the Complexified System 2.1 Stabilizability of Projected Systems For j=1,…,Nu, we have that λj is a pole of z↦(z⁢I-A)-1 of order m⁢(λj). We denote by ℓj the dimension of the eigenspace E⁢(λj)=Ker⁡(A-λj⁢I) associated with λj, that is,

	
dim⁡E⁢(λj)=ℓj= geometric multiplicity of ⁢λj.
	

We also introduce G⁢(λj)=Ker⁡((λj⁢I-A)m⁢(λj)), the generalized eigenspace associated with λj. Its dimension is finite and dim⁡G⁢(λj)=N⁢(λj)= algebraic multiplicity of λj. The space 𝐘 can be decomposed as follows:

	
𝐘=𝐘s⊕(⨁j=1NuG⁢(λj))=𝐘s⊕𝐘u,
	

where 𝐘s is invariant under et⁢A. The projection on G⁢(λj0) parallel to 𝐘s⊕(⨁j=1,j≠j0NuG⁢(λj)) is

	
ΠG⁢(λj0)=12⁢i⁢π⁢∫∣λ-λj0=ε(λ⁢I-A)-1⁢𝑑λ,
	

where the contour |λ-λj0|=ε>0 encloses only the eigenvalue λj0 and is covered counterclockwise (see [20]). We also set

	
Πu=⨁j=1NuΠG⁢(λj)⁢ and ⁢Πs=I-Πu⁢. 
	

We notice that Πu defined above is the projection from 𝐘 to 𝐘u parallel to 𝐘s, and Πs is the projection from 𝐘 to 𝐘s parallel to 𝐘u.

These results can be transposed to decompositions into subspaces invariant under et⁢A*. We know that λ is an eigenvalue of A if and only if λ¯ is an eigenvalue of A*. If λ¯j is an eigenvalue of A*, we denote by E*⁢(λ¯j) its eigenspace and by G*⁢(λ¯j) its generalized eigenspace. The space 𝐘 can be decomposed as follows:

	
𝐘=𝐘s*⊕(⨁j=1NuG*⁢(λ¯j))=𝐘s*⊕𝐘u*,
	




DE GRUYTER J.-P. Raymond, Stabilizability of Infinite Dimensional Systems by Finite Dimensional Control - 𝟐𝟕𝟑 where 𝐘S* is invariant under et⁢A*. The projection on G*⁢(λ¯j0) parallel to 𝐘S*⊕(⨁j=1,j≠j0NuG*⁢(λ¯j)) is

	
ΠG*⁢(λ¯j0)=12⁢i⁢π⁢∫|λ-λ¯j|=ε(λ⁢I-A*)-1⁢𝑑λ,
	

where the contour |λ-λ¯j0|=ε>0 encloses only the eigenvalue λ¯j0 and is covered counterclockwise. We also set

	
Πu*=⨁j=1NuΠG*⁢(λj¯)⁢ and ⁢Πs*=I-Πu*⁢, 
	

that is, Πu* is nothing but the adjoint of Πu, and Πs* is nothing but the adjoint of Πs. The operator Πu may be extended as a bounded operator from (D⁢(A*))′ to 𝐘u by setting

	
(D⁢(A*))′=𝐘u⊕𝐘¯S(D⁢(A*))′
	

and by defining Πu as the projection onto 𝐘u parallel to 𝐘¯s(D⁢(A*))′, where 𝐘¯s(D⁢(A*))′ is the closure of 𝐘s in (D⁢(A*))′ (see [32, Lemma 3.17]). The system (1.8) satisfied by 𝐲 can be split as follows:

	
{𝐲u′=Au⁢𝐲u+Bu⁢𝐮,	𝐲u⁢(0)=Πu⁢𝐲0,
𝐲s′=As⁢𝐲s+Bs⁢𝐮,	𝐲s⁢(0)=Πs⁢𝐲0,
	

with 𝐲u=Πu⁢𝐲,𝐲s=Πs⁢𝐲,Au=Πu⁢A,As=Πs⁢A,Bu=Πu⁢B and Bs=Πs⁢B. Due to (1.11), we have

	
∥et⁢As∥ℒ⁢((D⁢(A*))′)+∥et⁢As∥ℒ⁢(𝐘)≤C⁢e-(ω+δ)⁢t  with ⁢C≥1⁢ and ⁢δ>0.
	

To deal with the real system (1.1), we introduce Gℝ⁢(λj), the real generalized eigenspace associated with λj, that is, the real vector space spanned by Re⁡G⁢(λj)∪Im⁡G⁢(λj). The space Y can be decomposed as follows:

	
Y=YS⊕(⨁j=1NuGℝ⁢(λj))=YS⊕Yu,
	

where Yu and Ys are invariant under et⁢A. We still denote by Πu the projection onto Yu along Ys. It is clear that there is no ambiguity even if we use the same notation as for the projection onto the complex vector spaces 𝐘u along 𝐘s. Similarly, by setting Gℝ*⁢(λ¯j)=spanℝ⁡(Re⁡G*⁢(λ¯j)∪Im⁡G*⁢(λ¯j)), the space Y can also be decomposed as follows:

	
Y=YS*⊕(⨁j=1NuGℝ*⁢(λ¯j))=Ys*⊕Yu*,
	

where Yu* and Ys* are invariant under et⁢A*. The projection onto Yu* along Ys* is denoted by Πu*. Definition 2.1. A basis of G⁢(λj) of the form

	
{𝐞ik⁢(λj)∣k=1,…,ℓj,i=1,…,mkj}
	

will be called a canonical system (see [17-19]) when the two following conditions are satisfied:

	
{𝐞1k⁢(λj)∣k=1,…,ℓj}⁢ is a basis of ⁢E⁢(λj)⁢, 
	

For k=1,…,ℓj and i=2,…,mkj, one has (A-λj⁢I)⁢𝐞ik=𝐞i-1k. The above two conditions in Definition 2.1 may be summarized by writing

	
A⁢[𝐞11,…,𝐞m111,…,𝐞1ℓj,…,𝐞mℓjℓjℓj]=[𝐞11,…,𝐞m111,…,𝐞1ℓj,…,𝐞mℓjℓjℓj]⁢Λj
	

where Λj is an N⁢(λj)×N⁢(λj) matrix constituted of ℓj Jordan blocks and

	
N⁢(λj)=∑k=1ℓjmkj.
	




274 J.-P. Raymond, Stabilizability of Infinite Dimensional Systems by Finite Dimensional Control DE GRUYTER Proposition 2.2. For all 1≤j≤Nu, let

	
{𝚽ik⁢(λ¯j)∣k=1,…,ℓj,i=1,…,mkj}
	

be a canonical system of G*⁢(λ¯j). There exists a canonical system of G⁢(λj)

	
{𝐞ik⁢(λj)∣k=1,…,ℓj,i=1,…,mkj}
	

such that

	
Πu⁢𝝃=∑j=1NuΠG⁢(λj)⁢𝝃, where ⁢ΠG⁢(λj)⁢f=∑k=1ℓj∑i=1mkj(𝝃,𝚽mkj+1-ik⁢(λ¯j))𝐘⁢𝐞ik⁢(λj)⁢. 
	

Moreover,

	
(𝐞i1𝐤1⁢(λj1),𝚽i2k2⁢(λ¯j2))𝐘=δj1j2⁢δk1k2⁢δmk1j1+1-i1i2
	

for all j1,j2∈{1,…,Nu},k1∈{1,…,ℓj1},k2∈{1,…,ℓj2},i1∈{1,…,mk1j1} and i2∈{1,…,mk2j2}. In the above setting, (⋅,⋅)𝐘 denotes the inner product in the complex space 𝐘. For a proof of this proposition, we refer to [17, Theorem 3.1], [18, 19] and [32, Lemma 3.1]. We have a similar result when the role of G⁢(λj) and G*⁢(λ¯j) are changed. The operator Bu in (2.1) may be expressed as follows:

	
Bu⁢𝐮=∑j=1Nu∑k=1ℓj∑i=1mkj(𝐮,B*⁢𝚽mkj+1-ik⁢(λ¯j))𝐔⁢𝐞ik⁢(λj).
	

Here (⋅,⋅)𝐔 denotes the inner product in the complex space 𝐔. We notice that condition (v) in Theorem 1.4 is equivalent to the following condition: for all j=1,…,Nu, the family {B*⁢𝚽1k⁢(λ¯j)∣k=1,…,ℓj} is linearly independent. Since the operator A is defined in a real Hilbert space and knowing that λ is an eigenvalue of A if and only if λ¯ is an eigenvalue of A*, we have that A and A* have the same eigenvalues. Thus condition (2.3) is equivalent to the following condition: for all j=1,…,Nu, the family {B*⁢𝚽1k⁢(λj)∣k=1,…,ℓj} is linearly independent. With the notation above introduced, the complex space of actuators 𝐖 and the real space of actuators W introduced in (1.13) and (1.12) may be defined by

	
{𝐖=spanℂ⁡{B*⁢𝚽1k⁢(λ¯j)∣k=1,…,ℓj,j=1,…,Nu},
W=spanℝ⁡{Re⁡B*⁢𝚽1k⁢(λ¯j),Im⁡B*⁢𝚽1k⁢(λ¯j)∣k=1,…,ℓj,j=1,…,Nu}.
	

We introduce the operators 𝔹u=Πu⁢𝔹 and 𝔹ℂ,u=Πu⁢𝔹ℂ, and we state below stabilizability conditions for the projected systems onto Yu and 𝐘u. The definitions of the FCC for the pair (Au,Bu) in Yu or in 𝐘u can be adapted from those stated in Definition 1.1. This theorem will be helpful to prove Theorem 1.4.

Theorem 2.3. Assume that assumptions (1.2) and (1.3) are satisfied, and that (λj)1≤j≤Nu is the family of eigenvalues of the operator A satisfying (1.11). Then the following conditions are equivalent: (v) For all 1≤j≤Nu , one has Ker⁡(λ¯j⁢I-A*)∩Ker⁡(B*)={0}. (xii) The pair (Au,Bu) satisfies the FCC in 𝐘u, with controls in 𝐔 and with the prescribed exponential decay rate ω≥0. (xiii) The pair (Au,Bu) satisfies the FCC in Yu, with controls in U and with the prescribed exponential decay rate ω≥0. (xiv) For all 1≤j≤Nu, one has Ker⁡(λ¯j⁢I-Au*)∩Ker⁡(𝔹u*)={0}. (xv) For all 1≤j≤Nu, one has Ker⁡(λ¯j⁢I-Au*)∩Ker⁡(𝔹ℂ,u*)={0}.

DE GRUYTER J.-P. Raymond, Stabilizability of Infinite Dimensional Systems by Finite Dimensional Control -275 Proof. We prove this theorem in four steps. Step 1. If 1≤j≤Nu and 𝚽∈Ker⁡(λ¯j⁢I-A*), then 𝚽∈𝐘u* and B*⁢𝚽=Bu*⁢𝚽. Thus, we have:

	
 for all ⁢1≤j≤Nu,Ker⁡(λ¯j⁢I-A*)∩Ker⁡(B*)=Ker⁡(λ¯j⁢I-Au*)∩Ker⁡(Bu*)⁢. 
	

The equivalence between (v), (xii) and (xiii) follows from Proposition 1.3 applied to the pair (Au,Bu) and either the state space 𝐘u or the state space Yu, and the above identity.

Step 2. Let us prove that (v) is equivalent to (xv). We first prove that (v) implies (xv). Let Φj0 belong to Ker⁡(λ¯j0⁢I-A*) and satisfy 𝔹ℂ,u*⁢Φj0=0 for some 1≤j0≤Nu. We notice that 𝔹ℂ*⁢Φj0=𝔹ℂ,u*⁢Φj0=0. We have to show that Φj0=0. The operator 𝔹ℂ*∈ℒ⁢(D⁢(A*),ℂNc) is defined by

	
𝔹ℂ*Φ=((𝐰i,B*Φ)𝐔)1≤i≤Nc⋅
	

From the definitions of 𝔹ℂ* and 𝐖 it follows that B*⁢Φj0=0. From the Hautus criterion in (v) it follows that Φj0=0, and the proof is complete. Let us now show that (xv)⟹(v). Let us argue by contradiction. We assume that there exists

	
Φj0∈Ker⁡(λ¯j0⁢I-A*)
	

for some 1≤j0≤Nu and Φj0≠0 such that B*⁢Φj0=0. Due to the definition of 𝐖 in (2.4), it follows that 𝔹ℂ*⁢Φj0=0, which implies that Φj0=0 since the pair (A,𝔹ℂ) satisfies the Hautus criterion (xv). We clearly have a contradiction and (v) is proved.

Step 3. Let us prove that (v)⟹ (xiv). Let Φj belong to Ker⁡(λ¯j⁢I-A*) for some 1≤j≤Nu, and let it satisfy 𝔹*⁢Φj=0. To prove (xiv), we have to show that Φj=0. From the definitions of 𝔹ℂ,u*⁢Φj=𝔹*⁢Φj and W in (2.4) it follows that B*⁢Φj=0. From the Hautus criterion in (v) it follows that Φj0=0, and the proof is complete. Step 4. Now, we prove that (xiv) ⟹ (v). To prove (v), we argue by contradiction. We assume that there exists Φj0∈Ker⁡(λj0⁢I-A*) for some 1≤j0≤Nu, and Φj0≠0 such that B*⁢Φj0=0. In particular, we have B*⁢Re⁡Φj0=Re⁡B*⁢Φj0=0 and B*⁢Im⁡Φj0=Im⁡B*⁢Φj0=0. The operator 𝔹*∈ℒ⁢(D⁢(A*),ℝN) is defined by

	
𝔹*⁢Φ=((wi,B*⁢Φ)U)1≤i≤N*
	

Therefore,

	
𝔹*⁢Re⁡Φj0=𝔹u*⁢Re⁡Φj0=0  and  𝔹*⁢Im⁡Φj0=𝔹u*⁢Im⁡Φj0=0
	

which implies that Re⁡Φj0=0 and Im⁡Φj0=0 since the pair (Au,𝔹u) satisfies the Hautus criterion (xiv). We have a contradiction and (v) is proved. 2.2 Proofs of the Main Results Proof of Proposition 1.5. It follows from Theorem 2.3 and from the identities that for all 1≤j≤Nu,

	
Ker⁡(λ¯j⁢I-A*)∩Ker⁡(𝔹*)=Ker⁡(λ¯j⁢I-Au*)∩Ker⁡(𝔹u*)
	

and

	
Ker⁡(λ¯j⁢I-A*)∩Ker⁡(𝔹ℂ*)=Ker⁡(λ¯j⁢I-Au*)∩Ker⁡(𝔹ℂ,u*)
	

Proof of Theorem 1.4. We prove this theorem in ten steps. Step 1: (iv) ⟹( v). Due to (iv), the pair (A,𝔹ℂ) also satisfies the FCC in (D⁢(A*))′ with controls in ℂNc and with the prescribed exponential decay rate ω≥0. Let us notice that all the assumptions of Proposition 1.3 are satisfied by the pair (A,𝔹ℂ) with the state space (D⁢(A*))′ and the control space ℂNc. Therefore, the pair (A,𝔹ℂ) satisfies the Hautus criterion:

	
 for all ⁢1≤j≤Nu,Ker⁡(λ¯j⁢I-A*)∩Ker⁡(𝔹ℂ*)={0}
	

Due to Proposition 1.5, criterion (2.5) is equivalent to (v), and the proof is complete.

276 J.-P. Raymond, Stabilizability of Infinite Dimensional Systems by Finite Dimensional Control DE GRUYTER Step 2: (iii) ⟹ (v). Due to (iii), the pair (A,𝔹) also satisfies the FCC in (D⁢(A*))′ with controls in ℝN and with the prescribed exponential decay rate ω≥0. Therefore, due to Proposition 1.3, the pair (A,B) satisfies the Hautus criterion:

	
 for all ⁢1≤j≤Nu,Ker⁡(λ¯j⁢I-A*)∩Ker⁡(𝔹*)={0}.
	

According to Proposition 1.5, criterion (2.6) is equivalent to (v), and the proof is complete. Step 3: (v) ⟹ (iv). We first consider the projected system

	
𝐲u′=Au⁢𝐲u+∑i=1N𝐟i⁢(t)⁢Bu⁢𝐰i=Au⁢𝐲u+𝔹ℂ,u⁢𝐟⁢(t),𝐲u⁢(0)=Πu⁢𝐲0,
	

where 𝔹ℂ,u=Πu⁢𝔹ℂ. From Theorem 2.3 it follows that the Hautus criterion (xv) is satisfied. Thus the Riccati equation

	
𝐏∈ℒ⁢(𝐘u,𝐘u*),𝐏=𝐏*>0,𝐏⁢(Au+ω⁢Πu)+(Au*+ω⁢Πu*)⁢𝐏-𝐏𝐁ℂ,u⁢𝔹ℂ,u*⁢𝐏+Πu*⁢Πu=0
	

admits a unique solution, and there exists ε>0 such that

	
∥et⁢(Au+𝔹𝒞,u⁢𝕂)∥ℒ⁢(𝐘u)≤C⁢e-(ω+ε)⁢t,
	

where 𝕂=-𝔹ℂ,u*⁢𝐏⁢Πu. Let 𝐲u be the solution to the closed loop system

	
𝐲u′=(Au+𝔹ℂ,u⁢𝕂)⁢𝐲u,𝐲u⁢(0)=Πu⁢𝐲0.
	

Due to (2.8), we have

	
∥e(ω+ε)⋅𝐲u∥L2(0,∞;;𝐘u)<∞  and ∥e(ω+ε)⋅𝕂𝐲u∥L2⁢(0,∞;ℂNc)<∞.
	

Now we consider the system

	
𝐲s′=As⁢𝐲s+Πs⁢𝔹ℂ⁢𝕂⁢𝐲u,𝐲s⁢(0)=Πs⁢𝐲0.
	

The function eω⋅𝐲s satisfies

	
(eω⁢t⁢𝐲s)′=(As+ω⁢I)⁢(eω⁢t⁢𝐲s)+Πs⁢𝔹ℂ⁢K⁢eω⁢t⁢𝐲u,𝐲s⁢(0)=Πs⁢𝐲0.
	

From (2.2) it follows that (et⁢(As+ω⁢Πs))t≥0 is an exponentially stable and analytic semigroup on (D⁢(A*))′. Thus, from [12, Theorem 2.1, Chapter 3, Part I], (2.9) and (2.10) it follows that

	
∥eω⋅𝐲s∥L2⁢(0,∞;𝐘)<∞.
	

The proof of (iv) is complete. Step 4: (v) ⟹ (iii). This can be proved by adapting to the real system what is done in Step 3 for the complexified system.

Step 5: (v) ⟺ (vi). We first prove that (v) ⟹ (vi). In Step 3, we have proved that the solution 𝐲𝐲0 to the closed loop system

	
𝐲′=A⁢𝐲+𝔹ℂ⁢𝕂⁢𝐲,𝐲⁢(0)=𝐲0,
	

obeys

	
∥eω⋅𝐲𝐲0∥L2⁢(0,∞;𝐘)<∞.
	

Actually, we can prove that the mapping

	
𝐲0↦eω⁢𝐲𝐲0⁢(⋅)
	

is continuous from 𝐘 into L2⁢(0,∞;𝐘). In addition, eω⋅𝐲𝐲0⁢(⋅) belongs to Cb⁢([0,∞);(D⁢(A*))′). For that, it is enough to prove that the mapping

	
t↦𝐳⁢(t)=eω⁢t⁢∫0teAs⁢(t-τ)⁢Πs⁢𝔹ℂ⁢𝕂⁢𝐲u⁢(τ)⁢𝑑τ,
	




DE GRUYTER J.-P. Raymond, Stabilizability of Infinite Dimensional Systems by Finite Dimensional Control -277 where 𝐲u⁢(t)=et⁢(Au+𝔹c,u⁢𝕂)⁢Πu⁢𝐲0, is bounded and continuous from [0,∞) into (D⁢(A*))′. Using (2.2) and estimates for the convolution product, we can write With (2.9), we have that 𝐳 belongs to L∞⁢(0,∞;(D⁢(A*))′). The continuity of 𝐳 is obvious. Thus with (2.11) and Datko’s theorem, we obtain

	
∥et⁢(A+𝔹ℂ⁢𝕂)∥ℒ⁢((D⁢(A*))′)≤C⁢e-(ω+ε)⁢t⁢ for some ⁢ε>0.
	

Thus (A,𝔹ℂ) is stabilizable by feedback in (D⁢(A*))′ with the prescribed exponential decay rate ω≥0. To prove that (vi) ⟹(v), it is enough to apply Propositions 1.3 and 1.5. Step 6: (v) ⟺ (vii). The proof is very similar to that in Step 4 and is left to the reader. Step 7: (i) ⟹ (v). Due to (i), the pair (A,B) also satisfies the FCC in (D⁢(A*))′ with controls in U and with the prescribed exponential decay rate ω≥0. According to Proposition 1.3, the Hautus criterion (v) is satisfied. implies (i).

Step 9: We prove the equivalence (v)⟺ (viii) for the real system. The same equivalence can be proved similarly for the complexified system. We first notice that (v) ⟹ (vi) (Step 4) and that (vi) ⟹ (viii) (obvious). To prove the reverse statement, we notice that (viii) ⟹ (xiii). Indeed if A+B⁢K+ω⁢I is exponentially stable in (D⁢(A*))′, then

	
∥e(ω+ε)⋅e(A+B⁢K)⋅yu,0∥(D⁢(A*))′≤C⁢∥yu,0∥Yu  for all ⁢yu,0∈Yu⁢. 
	

The function yu=Πu⁢y satisfies the system

	
yu′=Au⁢yu+Bu⁢K⁢y,yu⁢(0)=yu,0,
	

and the estimate

	
∥e(ω+ε)⋅yu⁢(⋅)∥Yu≤C⁢∥yu,0∥Yu  for all ⁢yu,0∈Yu⁢. 
	

Thus (xiii) is proved with the control u=K⁢y. From Theorem 2.3 we have (xiii) ⟹ (v). The proof is complete. Step 10: (ii) ⟺ (v) This can be proved as in Steps 7 and 8 . Proof of Theorem 1.6. Due to (1.4) and the definitions of 𝔹 and 𝔹ℂ, we have

	
(λ0⁢I-A)α-1⁢𝔹∈ℒ⁢(ℝN,Y)⁢ and ⁢(λ0⁢I-A)α-1⁢𝔹ℂ∈ℒ⁢(ℂNc,𝐘)⁢, 
	

where 0<α≤1 and λ0>0 are the constants appearing in (1.4). As in Step 3 of the proof of Theorem 1.4, we set 𝕂=-𝔹ℂ,u*⁢𝐏⁢Πu, where 𝐏 is the solution to (2.7). Let us prove that if assumption (1.4) is satisfied, then the mapping

	
t↦𝐳⁢(t)=eω⁢t⁢∫0teAs⁢(t-τ)⁢Πs⁢𝔹ℂ⁢𝕂⁢𝐲u⁢(τ)⁢𝑑τ,
	

where eω⁢t⁢𝐲u⁢(t)=et⁢(Au+𝔹C,u⁢K+ω⁢I)⁢Πu⁢𝐲0, is bounded and continuous from [0, ∞ ) into 𝐘. For that, using (2.12), (2.2), estimates for analytic semigroups and estimates for the convolution product, we can write

	∥𝐳⁢(t)∥𝐘	≤∫0t∥eAs⁢(t-τ)⁢(λ0⁢I-A)1-α∥ℒ⁢(𝐘)⁢∥(λ0⁢I-A)α-1⁢Πs⁢𝔹ℂ⁢𝕂⁢𝐲u⁢(τ)∥𝐘⁢𝑑τ

278 J.-P. Raymond, Stabilizability of Infinite Dimensional Systems by Finite Dimensional Control DE GRUYTER Thus 𝐳 belongs to L∞⁢(0,∞;𝐘). We can now show that 𝐳 belongs to Cb⁢([0,∞);𝐘). Thus A+𝔹ℂ⁢𝕂, with domain D⁢(A+𝔹ℂ⁢𝕂)={𝐲∈𝐘∣A+𝔹ℂ⁢𝕂⁢𝐲∈𝐘}, is the infinitesimal generator of a strongly continuous semigroup on 𝐘. To prove that (et⁢(A+𝔹ℂ⁢𝕂⁢Πu+ω⁢I))t≥0 is exponentially stable, it is sufficient to prove that

	
t↦et⁢(A+𝔹ℂ⁢𝕂⁢Πu+ω⁢I)⁢𝐲0
	

belongs to L2⁢(0,∞;Y). This can be proved as in Step 5 of the proof of Theorem 1.4. 3 Applications Many existing results in the literature are concerned with the boundary stabilization of the linearized NavierStokes system with Dirichlet boundary conditions (see, e.g., [4-10, 29, 30, 32]). The case of mixed boundary conditions of Dirichlet/Neumann type is important for applications (see [1, 3]). In this section, we introduce a stabilizability result for the linearized Navier-Stokes system in the case of mixed boundary conditions. This result is obtained as a consequence of Theorem 1.6 and of a unique continuation result due to Fabre and Lebeau [13]. A similar result is proved in [27] for two dimensional domains. Here, we consider the three dimensional case. As far as we know, this case is not treated in the literature, even if the ingredients of the proof of stabilizability are similar to those introduced in [27] in the two dimensional case. Let Ωe be the three dimensional cylinder defined by

	
Ωe=(0,L)×{(x2,x3)∈ℝ2∣x22+x32<R2}, with ⁢R>0.
	

Let 𝒪 be a bounded domain of class C2 such that 𝒪¯⊂Ωe, and set Ω=Ωe\𝒪¯. We set

	Γin	={0}×{(x2,x3)∈ℝ2∣x22+x32<R2},	
	Γout	={0}×{(x2,x3)∈ℝ2∣x22+x32<R2},	
	ΓR	=(0,L)×{(x2,x3)∈ℝ2∣x22+x32=R2},	
	Γo	=∂⁡𝒪,	
	Γn	=ΓR∪Γout ,	
	Γd	=Γo∪Γin.	

Following [27], we set

	𝐕n,Γd0⁢(Ω)	={y∈L2⁢(Ω;ℝ3)∣div⁡y=0,y⋅n=0⁢ on ⁢Γd},	
	𝐕0⁢(Ω)	={y∈L2⁢(Ω;ℝ3)∣div⁡y=0},	
	𝐕Γd1⁢(Ω)	={y∈H1⁢(Ω;ℝ3)∩𝐕n,Γd0⁢(Ω)|y|Γd=0},	

The following orthogonal decomposition in L2⁢(Ω;ℝ3) is well known:

	
L2⁢(Ω;ℝ3)=𝐕n,Γd0⁢(Ω)⊕∇⁡HΓn1⁢(Ω),
	

where HΓn1⁢(Ω)={p∈H1⁢(Ω)|p|Γn=0}. The so-called Leray projector P is the orthogonal projector in L2⁢(Ω;ℝ3) onto 𝐕n,Γd0⁢(Ω). Let (zs,ps), a velocity and a pressure, satisfy the stationary incompressible Navier-Stokes equation (with a given right-hand side), Dirichlet (not necessarily homogeneous) boundary conditions on Γin ∪Γo, and Neumann (not necessarily homogeneous) boundary conditions on Γn. Our goal is to study the stabilizability of the following linearized system around (zs,ps), with a boundary control u :

	
{∂⁡y∂⁡t-v⁢Δ⁢y+(zs⋅∇)⁢y+(y⋅∇)⁢zs+∇⁡p=0	 in ⁢Q,
div⁡y=0	 in ⁢Q,
y=m⁢u	 on ⁢Σd,
σ⁢(y,p)⁢n=0	 on ⁢Σn,
P⁢y⁢(0)=P⁢y0	 in ⁢Ω.
	




DE GRUYTER J.-P. Raymond, Stabilizability of Infinite Dimensional Systems by Finite Dimensional Control -279 In this setting, σ⁢(y,p)=v⁢((∇⁡y)+(∇⁡y)T)-p⁢I is the Cauchy stress tensor, Q=Ω×(0,∞),Σd=Γd×(0,∞), Σn=Γn×(0,∞), and m∈C2⁢(Γd) takes values in [0,1],m|Γin =0 and m|Γc=1, where Γc is a relatively open subset in Γo. As noticed in [31], since m⁢u⋅n may be different from zero, the solution y to (3.1) does not belong to 𝐕n,Γd0⁢(Ω) and P⁢y⁢(t)≠y⁢(t). This is why the initial condition has to be stated for P⁢y and not for y.

System (3.1) is a prototype for stabilizing a fluid flow around an obstacle 𝒪. The homogeneous Neumann boundary condition on Σn is known as the do nothing boundary condition, and is used to approximate a fluid flow in an unbounded domain when Γn is far from the obstacle 𝒪, and Γin  may be used to prescribe a velocity in the equation satisfied by (zs,ps) and also inflow boundary perturbations in the equation satisfied by (y,p). Here, for simplicity, we have not included inflow perturbations in system (3.1).

Our goal is to show that Theorem 1.6 may be used to prove that system (3.1) is stabilizable by feedbacks of finite dimension with an arbitrary exponential decay rate ω>0. We assume that

	
zs∈H3/2+ε0⁢(Ω;ℝ3)∩𝐕0⁢(Ω),ps∈H1/2+ε0⁢(Ω;ℝ)  for some ⁢ε0>0.
	

For the geometrical domain Ω with Dirichlet boundary conditions on Γd and Neumann boundary conditions on Γn, this type of regularity result is proved in [25, Chapter 9] for the Stokes system and it can be proved a posteriori for the stationary Navier-Stokes system as in [27]. We set

	
a(y,ϕ)=∫Ω(v∇y:∇ϕ+[λ0y+(zs⋅∇)y+(y⋅∇)zs]⋅ϕ)dx,
	

and we choose a real number λ0>0 large enough so that

	
a⁢(y,ϕ)≥v2⁢∫Ω|∇⁡y|2⁢𝑑x  for all ⁢y∈𝐕Γd1⁢(Ω).
	

We define the unbounded operator (A,D⁢(A)) in 𝐕n,Γd0⁢(Ω) by

	
D⁢(A)={y∈𝐕Γd1⁢(Ω)∣ϕ↦a⁢(y,ϕ)⁢ is continuous in ⁢𝐕n,Γd0⁢(Ω)},
∫Ω(λ0⁢I-A)⁢y⁢ϕ⁢𝑑x=a⁢(y,ϕ)⁢ for all ⁢y∈D⁢(A)⁢ and all ⁢ϕ∈𝐕Γd1⁢(Ω).
	

We also introduce the adjoint bilinear form

	
a*⁢(ϕ,y)=a⁢(y,ϕ)  for all ⁢y∈𝐕Γd1⁢(Ω)⁢ and all ⁢ϕ∈𝐕Γd1⁢(Ω),
	

and (A*,D⁢(A*)), the adjoint of (A,D⁢(A)), is defined by

	
D⁢(A*)={ϕ∈𝐕Γd1⁢(Ω)∣y↦a*⁢(ϕ,y)⁢ is continuous in ⁢𝐕n,Γd0⁢(Ω)},
∫Ω(λ0⁢I-A*)⁢ϕ⁢y⁢𝑑x=a*⁢(ϕ,y)  for all ⁢ϕ∈D⁢(A*)⁢ and all ⁢y∈𝐕Γd1⁢(Ω).
	

Let us notice that the bilinear form a* can be extended to a bilinear form in HΓd1⁢(Ω;ℂ3)×HΓd1⁢(Ω;ℂ3), where HΓd1⁢(Ω;ℂ3)={𝐲∈H1⁢(Ω;ℂ3)|𝐲|Γd=0}, by setting

	
a*(𝚽,𝐲)=∫Ω(v∇𝚽:∇⁡𝐲¯+[λ0𝚽-(zs⋅∇)𝚽+(∇zs)T𝚽]⋅𝐲¯)dx.
	

We set U=L2⁢(Γd;ℝ3), and we introduce the Dirichlet operator G∈ℒ⁢(U,V0⁢(Ω)) defined by G⁢u=y, where

	
λ0⁢y-v⁢Δ⁢y+(zs⋅∇)⁢y+(y⋅∇)⁢zs+∇⁡p=0	 in ⁢Ω,
div⁡y=0	 in ⁢Ω,
y=u	 on ⁢Γd,
σ⁢(y,p)⁢n=0	 on ⁢Γn.
	




280 - J.-P. Raymond, Stabilizability of Infinite Dimensional Systems by Finite Dimensional Control DE GRUYTER Following [27], we introduce the operator B∈ℒ⁢(U,(D⁢(A*))′) defined by

	
B=(λ0⁢I-A)⁢P⁢G⁢M,
	

where M∈ℒ⁢(U) is defined by M⁢u=m⁢u. The pair (A,B) satisfies (1.2) and (1.4) for all 0≤α<14. As in [27], we can show that a function y∈L2⁢(0,T;H1⁢(Ω;ℝ3))∩L∞⁢(0,T;L2⁢(Ω;ℝ3)) is a weak solution to equation (3.1) if and only if (P⁢y,(I-P)⁢y) satisfies the system

Thus to stabilize system (3.1) it is necessary and sufficient to stabilize the first equation of (3.3). We can verify that assumptions (1.2)-(1.4) are satisfied by the pair (A,B) for all 0≤α<14 (see [27]), and Theorem 1.6 applies to prove the stabilizability of the first equation of (3.3), that is, of the pair (A,B), in the state space 𝐕n,Γd0⁢(Ω). The operator B*∈ℒ⁢(D⁢(A*),U), the adjoint of B, is defined by (see [27])

	
B*=M⁢G*⁢(λ0⁢I-A*)
	

In order to verify the Hautus criterion, we introduce the adjoint eigenvalue problem:

	
{ Find ⁢λ∈ℂ,𝚽∈H1⁢(Ω;ℂ3)⁢ and ⁢𝚿∈L2⁢(Ω;ℂ)⁢ such that 
λ⁢𝚽-v⁢Δ⁢𝚽-(zs⋅∇)⁢𝚽+(∇⁡zs)T⁢𝚽+∇⁡𝚿=0⁢ in ⁢Ω
div⁡𝚽=0⁢in⁡Ω,𝚽=0⁢ on ⁢Γd,σ⁢(𝚽,𝚿)⁢n+zs⋅n⁢𝚽=0⁢ on ⁢Γn
	

If (λ,𝚽,𝚿) is a solution of (3.4), then we have (see [27])

	
B*⁢𝚽=(m⁢v⁢∂⁡𝚽∂⁡n-m⁢𝚿⁢n)|Γc.
	

It can be shown that a pair (λ,𝚽,𝚿)∈ℂ×H1⁢(Ω;ℂ3)×L2⁢(Ω;ℂ) is a solution to (3.4) if and only if (λ, 𝚽,𝚿) solves the following problem: Find λ∈ℂ and 𝚽∈D⁢(A*) such that (λ⁢I-A*)⁢𝚽=0 and 𝚿∈L2⁢(Ω;ℂ) such that Due to the presence of mixed boundary conditions, the solution 𝚽 to (3.4) belongs to H3/2+ε0⁢(Ω;ℂ3) or to a weighted Sobolev space (see [25, Theorem 9.4.5]), but not to H2⁢(Ω;ℂ3). Thus the term v⁢Δ⁢𝚽⋅n in the boundary condition (3.5e) is not well defined. The solution to (3.5c)-(3.5e) can be defined by a transposition method as in [16] for the two dimensional case or in [24, Proposition 4.5] for the three dimensional case.

The pressure 𝚿 can be defined by an alternative approach. Once we know that (𝚽,λ) is the solution to the first line of (3.5a), the pressure 𝚿 can be characterized by noting that (𝚽,𝚿) is the unique solution to the mixed variational problem

	
{ Find ⁢𝚽∈HΓd1⁢(Ω;ℂ3)⁢ and ⁢𝚿∈L2⁢(Ω;ℂ)⁢ such that 
a*⁢(𝚽,𝐲)-∫Ω𝚿⁢div⁡𝐲¯⁢𝑑x=(λ0-λ)⁢∫Ω𝚽⋅𝐲¯⁢𝑑x⁢ for all ⁢𝐲∈HΓd1⁢(Ω;ℂ3)
∫Ωξ⁢𝐝𝐢𝐯⁡𝚽¯⁢𝑑x=0⁢ for all ⁢𝝃∈L2⁢(Ω;ℂ)
	




DE GRUYTER J.-P. Raymond, Stabilizability of Infinite Dimensional Systems by Finite Dimensional Control - 281 Since the right-hand side in the second line of (3.6) is known, the existence and uniqueness of the solution to the mixed variational formulation can be obtained by adapting to the Oseen system what is done in [ 25 , Chapter 9] for the Stokes system.

Assume that (λ¯j)1≤j≤Nu are the eigenvalues of systems (3.4) or (3.5) with real part greater than or equal to -ω. Let us denote by ((𝚽1k⁢(λ¯j),𝚿1k⁢(λ¯j)))1≤k≤ℓj the solutions to system (3.4) corresponding to λ¯j and constituting a basis of the corresponding eigenspace. By using Theorem 1.6, it can be shown that if, for all 1≤j≤Nu, the family

	
{(v⁢∂⁡𝚽1k⁢(λ¯j)∂⁡n-𝚿1k⁢(λ¯j)⁢n)|Γc∣k=1,…,ℓj}
	

is linearly independent, then system (3.2) is stabilizable by feedback with the prescribed exponential decay rate ω. To verify the linear independence condition stated in (3.7) for all 1≤j≤Nu, we argue by contradiction. We assume that there exist 1≤j0≤Nu and a non-zero function 𝚽∈Ker⁡(λ¯j0⁢I-A*) such that

	
(v⁢∂⁡𝚽∂⁡n-𝚿⁢n)|Γc=0,
	

where 𝚿 is the pressure associated with 𝚽. The pair (𝚽,𝚿) obeys

	
{λ¯j0⁢𝚽-v⁢Δ⁢𝚽-(zs⋅∇)⁢𝚽+(∇⁡zs)T⁢𝚽+∇⁡𝚿=0⁢ in ⁢Ω,
div⁡𝚽=0⁢ in ⁢Ω,
𝚽=0⁢ and ⁢v⁢∂⁡𝚽∂⁡n-𝚿⁢n=0⁢ on ⁢Γc.
	

Using an extension procedure and a unique continuation result from [13], we deduce that the solution 𝚽 to (3.8) is zero. We get a contradiction, and the stabilizability of (A,B) by feedback in 𝐕n,Γd0⁢(Ω) with the prescribed exponential decay rate ω is proved. The stabilizability by feedback with controls in W, with W defined by (1.12), follows from Theorem 1.6.","1 Introduction Let U and Y be real separable Hilbert spaces. Let A, with domain D⁢(A), be the infinitesimal generator of a c0-semigroup on Y. We consider the following control system:

	
y′⁢(t)=A⁢y⁢(t)+B⁢u⁢(t),t>0,y⁢(0)=y0.
	

In this paper, we are interested in the stabilizability of system (1.1) by controls of finite dimension when (A,D⁢(A)) is the infinitesimal generator of a strongly continuous analytic semigroup on Y, the resolvent of A is compact in Y, and B is an unbounded operator from U into Y, satisfying either

	
B∈ℒ⁢(U,(D⁢(A*))′),
	

or an assumption stronger than (1.3), namely:

	
(λ0⁢I-A)α-1⁢B∈ℒ⁢(U,Y),0<α≤1⁢, for some ⁢λ0>0.
	

Let (et⁢A)t≥0 be the semigroup on Y generated by (A,D⁢(A)). By the so-called extrapolation method, (et⁢A)t≥0 can be extended to a strongly continuous analytic semigroup on (D⁢(A*))′, still denoted by (et⁢A)t≥0 to simplify the notation. Thus, for every y0∈Y and every u∈Lloc 2⁢([0,∞);U), the unique solution y to equation (1.1) is defined by the formula

	
y⁢(t)=et⁢A⁢y0+∫0te(t-s)⁢A⁢B⁢u⁢(s)⁢𝑑s.
	

By [12, Theorem 2.1, Chapter 3, Part I], the function y in (1.5) belongs to C⁢([0,∞);(D⁢(A*))′)∩Lloc 2⁢([0,∞);Y). *Corresponding author: Jean-Pierre Raymond, IMT, UMR 5219, Université Paul Sabatier Toulouse III & CNRS, 31062 Toulouse Cedex, France, e-mail: raymond@math.univ-toulouse.fr

798 J.-P. Raymond, Stabilizability of Infinite-Dimensional Systems DE GRUYTER By controls of finite dimension, we mean controls u of the form

	
u⁢(t)=∑i=1Nfi⁢(t)⁢wi
	

with wi∈U and fi⁢(t)∈ℝ. By introducing 𝔹∈ℒ⁢(ℝN,(D⁢(A*))′), defined by

	
𝔹⁢f=∑i=1Nfi⁢B⁢wi, with ⁢f=(f1,…,fN)∈ℝN⁢, 
	

equation (1.1) with controls of the form (1.6) may be rewritten as

	
y′⁢(t)=A⁢y⁢(t)+𝔹⁢f⁢(t),t>0,y⁢(0)=y0.
	

To study the stabilizability of system (1.1), it is interesting to introduce the associated complexified system. For that, we set

	
𝐘=Y+i⁢Y,
	

and we shall write in ”boldface” functions taking values in ℂ. With this notation convention, the complexified system associated with (1.1) is written in the form

	
𝐲′⁢(t)=A⁢𝐲⁢(t)+B⁢𝐮⁢(t),t>0,𝐲⁢(0)=𝐲0
	

In (1.8), we look for stabilizing controls 𝐮 belonging to L2⁢(0,∞;𝐔), where 𝐔=U+i⁢U is the complexified space associated with U and (A,D⁢(A)) is considered as the unbounded operator in the complexified space 𝐘. As usual, A⁢𝐲⁢(t) and B⁢𝐮⁢(t) are defined by

	
A⁢𝐲⁢(t)=A⁢Re⁡(𝐲⁢(t))+i⁢A⁢Im⁡(𝐲⁢(t))  and  B⁢𝐮⁢(t)=B⁢Re⁡(𝐮⁢(t))+i⁢B⁢Im⁡(𝐮⁢(t)).
	

To define the complexified system associated with (1.7), we can either complexify the control variable f=(f1,…,fN) or complexify both the control variable f=(f1,…,fN) and the actuators (w1,…,wN). We choose this second option. Thus we first introduce complex-valued actuators by setting

	
𝐖=spanℂ⁡{𝐰1,…,𝐰Nc}, where ⁢{𝐰1,…,𝐰Nc}⊂𝐔
	

and we next introduce the real-valued actuators associated to 𝐖 by setting

	
W=spanℝ⁡{w1,…,wN}=spanℝ⁡{Re⁡𝐰j,Im⁡𝐰j:1≤j≤Nc}⊂U.
	

With this choice, the complexified system associated with (1.7) is

	
𝐲′⁢(t)=A⁢𝐲⁢(t)+𝔹ℂ⁢𝐟⁢(t),t>0,𝐲⁢(0)=𝐲0
	

where

	
𝔹ℂ⁢𝐟=∑j=1Nc𝐟j⁢B⁢𝐰j  for all ⁢𝐟=(𝐟1,…,𝐟Nc)∈ℂNc⁢. 
	

Since there are different notions of stabilizability, we now state the precise definitions that we are going to consider. We start with the so-called open loop stabilizability, or equivalently the Finite Cost Condition. Definition 1.1. We say that the pair (A,B) satisfies the so-called Finite Cost Condition in Y (FCC in Y for short) with controls in U and with the prescribed exponential decay rate ω≥0 when, for any y0∈Y, there exists uy0∈L2⁢(0,∞;U) such that t↦eω⁢t⁢uy0⁢(t)∈L2⁢(0,∞;U) and the solution yy0,uy0 to system (1.1), associated with the control uy0, obeys ∫0∞∥eω⁢t⁢yy0,uy0⁢(t)∥Y2⁢𝑑t<∞.

We say that the pair (A,B) satisfies the FCC in 𝐘 with controls in 𝐔 and with the prescribed exponential decay rate ω≥0 when, for any 𝐲0∈𝐘, there exists 𝐮𝐲0∈L2⁢(0,∞;𝐔) such that t↦eω⁢t⁢𝐮𝐲0⁢(t)∈L2⁢(0,∞;𝐔) and the solution 𝐲𝐲0,𝐮𝐲0 to system (1.8), associated with the control 𝐮𝐲0, obeys ∫0∞∥eω⁢t⁢𝐲𝐲0,𝐮𝐲0⁢(t)∥𝐘2⁢𝑑t<∞. The FCC in Y (resp. in 𝐘) for the pair (A,B) with controls in W (resp. in 𝐖 ) is expressed in terms of a FCC for the pair (A,𝔹) (resp. the pair (A,𝔹ℂ)).

We say that the pair (A,𝔹) satisfies the FCC in Y with controls in ℝN and with the prescribed exponential decay rate ω≥0 when, for any y0∈Y, there exists fy0∈L2⁢(0,∞;ℝN) such that t↦eω⁢t⁢fy0⁢(t)∈L2⁢(0,∞;ℝN) and the solution yy0,fy0 to system (1.7), associated with the control fy0, obeys ∫0∞∥eω⁢t⁢yy0,fy0⁢(t)∥Y2⁢𝑑t<∞.

DE GRUYTER J.-P. Raymond, Stabilizability of Infinite-Dimensional Systems ⟶799 We say that the pair (A,𝔹ℂ) satisfies the F⁢C⁢C in 𝐘 with controls in ℂNc and with the prescribed exponential decay rate ω≥0 when, for any 𝐲0∈𝐘, there exists 𝐟y0∈L2⁢(0,∞;ℂNc) such that t↦eω⁢t⁢𝐟y0⁢(t)∈L2⁢(0,∞;ℂNc) and the solution 𝐲𝐲0,𝐟𝐲0 to system (1.9), associated with the control 𝐟𝐲0, obeys ∫0∞∥eω⁢t⁢𝐲𝐲0,𝐟𝐲0⁢(t)∥𝐘2⁢𝑑t<∞. We now state definitions of closed loop stabilizability or stabilizability by feedback. Definition 1.2. We say that the pair (A,B) is stabilizable by feedback in Y with the prescribed exponential decay rate ω≥0 when there exists an operator K∈ℒ(Y, U such that A+ω⁢I+B⁢K, with domain

	
D⁢(A+ω⁢I+B⁢K)={y∈Y:(A+B⁢K)⁢y∈Y},
	

is the infinitesimal generator of a strongly continuous exponentially stable semigroup on Y. We say that the pair (A,B) is stabilizable by feedback in 𝐘 with the prescribed exponential decay rate ω≥0 when there exists an operator K∈ℒ⁢(𝐘,𝐔) such that A+ω⁢I+B⁢K, with domain

	
D⁢(A+ω⁢I+B⁢K)={𝐲∈𝐘:(A+B⁢K)⁢𝐲∈𝐘},
	

is the infinitesimal generator of a strongly continuous exponentially stable semigroup on 𝐘. We say that the pair (A,𝔹) is stabilizable by feedback in Y with the prescribed exponential decay rate ω≥0 when there exists an operator 𝕂∈ℒ⁢(Y,ℝN) such that A+ω⁢I+𝔹⁢𝕂, with domain

	
D⁢(A+ω⁢I+𝔹⁢K)={y∈Y:(A+𝔹⁢𝕂)⁢y∈Y},
	

is the infinitesimal generator of a strongly continuous exponentially stable semigroup on Y. We say that the pair (A,𝔹ℂ) is stabilizable by feedback in 𝐘 with the prescribed exponential decay rate ω≥0 when there exists an operator 𝕂∈ℒ⁢(𝐘,ℂNc) such that A+ω⁢I+𝔹ℂ⁢𝕂, with domain

	
D⁢(A+ω⁢I+𝔹ℂ⁢𝕂)={𝐲∈𝐘:(A+𝔹ℂ⁢𝕂)⁢y∈𝐘},
	

is the infinitesimal generator of a strongly continuous exponentially stable semigroup on 𝐘. Let us first recall some known results from the literature. The stabilizability of system (1.1) when B∈ℒ⁢(U,Y) has been studied by many authors in the seventies. We can mention [33], [11] and we refer to the survey by Pritchard and Zabzyck [28]. When A is the infinitesimal generator of an analytic semigroup with a compact resolvent, stabilizability results may also be deduced from approximate controllability results stated in [14, 15].

To summarize these contributions to the stabilizability issue, we refer to [12, Proposition 3.3, Chapter 1, Part III]. The precise statement is the following.

Proposition 1.3. Assume that B∈ℒ⁢(U,Y) (or B∈ℒ⁢(𝐔,𝐘) ). Let σ⁢(A) be the spectrum of A and let us introduce σs⁢(A)={λ∈σ⁢(A):Re⁡(λ)<0},σ0⁢(A)={λ∈σ⁢(A):Re⁡(λ)=0} and σu⁢(A)={λ∈σ⁢(A):Re⁡(λ)>0}. Assume that σ0⁢(A)∪σu⁢(A) consists of a finite set of eigenvalues of finite multiplicity, and that there exist δ>0 and Cs>0 such that

	
supλ∈σs⁢(A)⁡Re⁡(λ)<-δ  and  ∥et⁢A⁢(I-Πu)∥ℒ⁢(Y)≤Cs⁢e-δ⁢t  for all ⁢t≥0,
	

where Πu is the projector defined by

	
Πu=12⁢i⁢π⁢∫γ0,u(λ⁢I-A)-1⁢𝑑λ,
	

and y0,u is a single Jordan curve surrounding σ0⁢(A)∪σu⁢(A) and no other element of σ⁢(A), described counterclockwise. Then the following statements are equivalent: (a) The pair (A,B) is stabilizable with respect to I. (b) For all λ∈σ0⁢(A)∪σu⁢(A),Ker⁡(λ¯⁢I-A*)∩Ker⁡(B*)={0}. In [12], the definition of ”the pair (A,B) is stabilizable with respect to I” corresponds to ”the pair (A,B) satisfies the FCC in Y with controls in U and with the prescribed exponential decay rate ω=0 ”.

For real-valued systems A and A* have the same eigenvalues and λ¯ in Ker⁡(λ¯⁢I-A*), condition (b), may be replaced by λ. This is what is stated in [12, Proposition 3.3, Chapter 1, Part III].

800 J.-P. Raymond, Stabilizability of Infinite-Dimensional Systems DE GRUYTER Notice that (1.10) holds to be true when assumption (1.2) is satisfied. Condition (b) in Proposition 1.3 is known as the Hautus criterion for stabilizability. Since for bounded control operators the FCC is equivalent to the stabilizability by feedback, Proposition 1.3 shows that the Hautus criterion is equivalent to the FCC in Y (resp. Y) with controls in U (resp. U), but also to the stabilizability by feedback.

In this paper, we would like to see if, when assumption (1.3) or (1.4) is satisfied, the Hautus criterion is equivalent or not to the FCC in Y with controls in U, to the FCC condition in Y with controls in W, for some specific space W, and to the stabilizability by feedback.

There is a class of unbounded control operators B, called admissible operators for the semigroup (et⁢A)t≥0 on Y. A control operator B∈ℒ⁢(U,(D⁢(A*))′) is an admissible operator for the semigroup (et⁢A)t≥0 on Y when, for every u∈Lloc 2⁢([0,∞);U) and every y0∈Y, the solution to y to equation (1.1) belongs to C⁢([0,∞);Y) (see [34, Definition 4.2.1]). Using the Duhamel formula (1.5) and the Young inequality for convolution products, if assumption (1.4) is satisfied for some 12<α≤1, then the operator B is admissible for (et⁢A)t≥0 in Y. In that case, it can be shown that the Hautus criterion is equivalent to the stabilizability by feedback (see Theorem 1.6).

There are several contributions to the feedback stabilization of system (1.1) when assumptions (1.2) and (1.4) are satisfied. For parabolic equations with Neumann, Fourier or Dirichlet boundary conditions, we refer to [2, 21, 22, 26], and [23] and the references therein. In particular in [23, Theorem 2.2.1], it is proved that under assumptions (1.2) and (1.4), the FCC in Y with controls in U of the pair (A,B) is equivalent to the stabilizability by feedback (see a more detailed comparison at the end of this section). Some results on the feedback stabilization for finite-dimensional controls may also be found in [2,21,22,26].

Despite the many contributions in the literature, we are not informed of stabilizability results by finitedimensional controls in the case when B obeys assumption (1.3) or (1.4), similar to the one stated in Proposition 1.3, except in the case when σ⁢(A) is semi-simple (see e.g. [10] in the case of the boundary control of the linearized Navier-Stokes equations), and except two recent contributions by Badra and Takahashi [7, 8]. In order to state the main result of the paper, we have to precisely define the space of actuators W. We do it now. Under assumption (1.2), for ω≥0 given, there is a finite number of eigenvalues (λj)1≤j≤Nu of the operator A, with real part greater or equal than -ω. Without loss of generality, we can assume that we are in the following situation:

	
⋯<Re⁡λNu+1<-ω≤Re⁡λNu≤Re⁡λNu-1≤⋯≤Re⁡λ1
	

We denote by E⁢(λj)=Ker⁡(λj⁢I-A) the eigenspace of A associated with λj and by E*⁢(λ¯j)=Ker⁡(λ¯j⁢I-A*) the eigenspace of A* associated with λ¯j. The spaces Re⁡E⁢(λj) (resp. Im⁡E⁢(λj) ) denotes the real vector space generated by the real parts (resp. the imaginary parts) of vectors belonging to E⁢(λj). Similar definitions can be set out for Re⁡E*⁢(λ¯j) and Im⁡E*⁢(λ¯j). Throughout what follows, we set W=spanℝ⁡(⋃j=1Nu(Re⁡B*⁢E*⁢(λ¯j)∪Im⁡B*⁢E*⁢(λ¯j))) and

	
𝐖=spanℂ⁢⋃j=1NuB*⁢E*⁢(λ¯j)
	

Our main goal is to prove the following stabilizability result. Theorem 1.4. Assume that assumptions (1.2) and (1.3) are satisfied, and that (λj)1≤j≤Nu is the family of eigenvalues of the operator A satisfying (1.11). Then the following conditions are equivalent: (i) The pair (A,B) satisfies the FCC in Y with controls in U and with the prescribed exponential decay rate ω≥0 (ii) The pair (A,B) satisfies the FCC in 𝐘 with controls in 𝐔 and with the prescribed exponential decay rate ω≥0. (iii) The pair (A,B) satisfies the FCC in Y with controls ℝN and with the prescribed exponential decay rate ω≥0.

DE GRUYTER J.-P. Raymond, Stabilizability of Infinite-Dimensional Systems ⟶𝟖𝟎𝟏 (iv) The pair (A,𝔹ℂ) satisfies the FCC in 𝐘 with controls ℂNc and with the prescribed exponential decay rate ω≥0. (v) For all 1≤j≤Nu,Ker⁡(λ¯j⁢I-A*)∩Ker⁡(B*)={0}. (vi) The pair (A,𝔹) is stabilizable by feedback in (D⁢(A*))′ with the prescribed exponential decay rate ω≥0. (vii) The pair (A,𝔹ℂ) is stabilizable by feedback in (D⁢(A*))′ with the prescribed exponential decay rate ω≥0. (viii) The pair (A,B) is stabilizable by feedback in (D⁢(A*))′ with the prescribed exponential decay rate ω≥0. (This statement is valid both for the real system and the associated complexified system.) We state below two Hautus criteria equivalent to the Hautus criterion stated in (v) in the above theorem. Proposition 1.5. Assume that assumptions (1.2) and (1.3) are satisfied, and that (λj)1≤j≤Nu is the family of eigenvalues of the operator A satisfying (1.11). Then the following conditions are equivalent: (v) For all 1≤j≤Nu,Ker⁡(λ¯j⁢I-A*)∩Ker⁡(B*)={0}. (ix) For all 1≤j≤Nu,Ker⁡(λ¯j⁢I-A*)∩Ker⁡(𝔹*)={0}. (x) For all 1≤j≤Nu, Ker⁡(λ¯j⁢I-A*)∩Ker⁡(𝔹ℂ*)={0}. Let us complete the above theorem by stating a short result on the stabilizability by feedback in Y. Theorem 1.6. Assume that assumptions of Theorem 1.4 are fulfilled and that in addition assumption (1.4) is satisfied. Then the conditions (i)-(x) of Theorem 1.4 and Proposition 1.5 are equivalent to the following one: (xi) The pair (A,𝔹) (resp. (A,𝔹ℂ)) is stabilizable by feedback in Y (resp. Y) with the prescribed exponential decay rate ω≥0.

Comparison with results in [23]. Theorems 1.4 and 1.6 may be compared with some statements in [23]. In [23, Theorem 2.2.1], the pair (A,B) is assumed to satisfy (1.2) and (1.4). The FCC in Y is assumed, and the link between the FCC in Y with the Hautus criterion is not done in [23]. It rather refers to specific properties of parabolic equations (see [23, Section Verification of the FCC, p. 173,]). In [23, Theorem 2.2.1], the stabilizability by feedback in Y is proved via the theory of Riccati equations. A uniqueness result for the Riccati equations is proved under a detectability condition satisfied by (A,C), where C is the observation operator involved in the Riccati equation. Here, in order to construct a feedback, contrarily to [23], we do not use an infinite-dimensional Riccati equation, but a Riccati equation stated in a finite-dimensional space. This approach is well adapted to numerical approximation as shown in [1]. Thus it seems that Theorem 1.4 is the first one in which the FCC is shown to be equivalent to the Hautus criterion for unbounded control operators in the case of parabolic systems.

Comparison with results in [7,8]. In [8, Theorem 3.5] the authors state a stabilizability result by feedback when the pair (A,B) satisfies (1.2) and (1.4). It is stated there that the Hautus criterion is equivalent to the stabilizability by feedback. The stabilizability of the pair (A,𝔹), that is the feedback stabilization by finite dimension controls, is also considered in [8, Theorem 3.5], but not for an explicit finite-dimensional control space as in Theorem 1.6, even if [8, Remark 3.7] provides some indications for that. Let us mention that no result is stated in [7,8] when only assumptions (1.2) and (1.3) are satisfied. 2 Stabilizability of the Complexified System 2.1 Stabilizability of Projected Systems For j=1,…,Nu,λj is a pole of z↦(z⁢I-A)-1 of order m⁢(λj). We denote by ℓj the dimension of the eigenspace E⁢(λj)=Ker⁡(A-λj⁢I) associated with λj, that is, dim⁡E⁢(λj)=ℓj= geometric multiplicity of λj. We also introduce G⁢(λj)=Ker⁡((λj⁢I-A)m⁢(λj)), the generalized eigenspace associated with λj. Its dimension is finite and dim⁡G⁢(λj)=N⁢(λj)= algebraic multiplicity of λj.

802 J.-P. Raymond, Stabilizability of Infinite-Dimensional Systems DE GRUYTER The space 𝐘 can be decomposed as follows:

	
𝐘=𝐘s⊕(⨁j=1NuG⁢(λj))=𝐘s⊕𝐘u
	

where 𝐘s is invariant under et⁢A. The projection on G⁢(λj0) parallel to 𝐘s⊕(⨁j=1,j≠j0NuG⁢(λj)) is

	
ΠG⁢(λj0)=12⁢i⁢π⁢∫∣λ-λj0∣=ε(λ⁢I-A)-1⁢𝑑λ,
	

where the contour |λ-λj0|=ε>0 encloses only the eigenvalue λj0 and is covered counterclockwise (see [20]). We also set

	
Πu=⨁j=1NuΠG⁢(λj)⁢ and ⁢Πs=I-Πu
	

We notice that Πu above defined is the projection from 𝐘 to 𝐘u parallel to 𝐘s, and Πs is the projection from 𝐘 to 𝐘s parallel to 𝐘u.

These results can be transposed to decompositions into subspaces invariant under et⁢A*. We know that λ is an eigenvalue of A if and only if λ¯ is an eigenvalue of A*. If λ¯j is an eigenvalue of A*, we denote by E*⁢(λ¯j) its eigenspace and by G*⁢(λ¯j) its generalized eigenspace. The space 𝐘 can be decomposed as follows:

	
𝐘=𝐘s*⊕(⨁j=1NuG*⁢(λ¯j))=𝐘s*⊕𝐘u*
	

where 𝐘s* is invariant under et⁢A*. The projection on G*⁢(λ¯j0) parallel to 𝐘s*⊕(⨁j=1,j≠j0NuG*⁢(λ¯j)) is

	
ΠG*⁢(λ¯j0)=12⁢i⁢π⁢∫|λ-λ¯j0|=ε(λ⁢I-A*)-1⁢𝑑λ,
	

where the contour |λ-λ¯j0|=ε>0 encloses only the eigenvalue λ¯j0 and is covered counterclockwise. We also set

	
Πu*=⨁j=1NuΠG*⁢(λ¯j)⁢ and ⁢Πs*=I-Πu*⁢, 
	

Πu* is nothing but the adjoint of Πu, and Πs* is nothing but the adjoint of Πs. The operator Πu may be extended as a bounded operator from (D⁢(A*))′ to 𝐘u by setting

	
(D⁢(A*))′=𝐘u⊕𝐘¯s⁢(D⁢(A*))′
	

and by defining Πu as the projection onto 𝐘u parallel to 𝐘¯s(D⁢(A*))′, where 𝐘¯s(D⁢(A*))′ is the closure of 𝐘s in (D⁢(A*))′ (see [32, Lemma 3.17]). System (1.8) satisfied by 𝐲 can be split as follows:

	
𝐲u′=Au⁢𝐲u+Bu⁢𝐮,	𝐲u⁢(0)=Πu⁢𝐲0
𝐲s′=As⁢𝐲s+Bs⁢𝐮,	𝐲s⁢(0)=Πs⁢𝐲0
	

with 𝐲u=Πu⁢𝐲,𝐲s=Πs⁢𝐲,Au=Πu⁢A,As=Πs⁢A,Bu=Πu⁢B,Bs=Πs⁢B, and due to (1.11) we have

	
∥et⁢As∥ℒ⁢((D⁢(A*))′)+∥et⁢As∥ℒ⁢(𝐘)≤C⁢e-(ω+δ)⁢t  with ⁢C≥1⁢ and ⁢δ>0
	

To deal with the real system (1.1), we introduce Gℝ⁢(λj), the real generalized eigenspace associated with λj, that is the real vector space spanned by Re⁡G⁢(λj)∪Im⁡G⁢(λj). The space Y can be decomposed as follows:

	
Y=Ys⊕(⨁j=1NuGℝ⁢(λj))=Ys⊕Yu,
	




DE GRUYTER J.-P. Raymond, Stabilizability of Infinite-Dimensional Systems - 803 where Yu and Ys are invariant under et⁢A. We still denote by Πu the projection onto Yu along Ys. It is clear that there is no ambiguity even if we use the same notation as for the projection onto the complex vector spaces 𝐘u along 𝐘s. Similarly, setting Gℝ*⁢(λ¯j)=spanℝ⁡(Re⁡G*⁢(λ¯j)∪Im⁡G*⁢(λ¯j)), the space Y can also be decomposed as follows:

	
Y=Ys*⊕(⨁j=1NuGℝ*⁢(λ¯j))=Ys*⊕Yu*,
	

where Yu* and Ys* are invariant under et⁢A*. The projection onto Yu* along Ys* is denoted by Πu*. Definition 2.1. A basis of G⁢(λj) of the form

	
{𝐞ik⁢(λj):k=1,…,ℓj,i=1,…,mkj}
	

will be called a canonical system (see [17-19]) when the two following conditions are satisfied: (1) {𝐞1k⁢(λj):k=1,…,ℓj} is a basis of E⁢(λj), (2) For k=1,…,ℓj and i=2,…,mkj,(A-λj⁢I)⁢𝐞ik=𝐞i-1k. The above two conditions in Definition 2.1 may be summarized by writing

	
A⁢[𝐞11,…,𝐞m111,…,𝐞1ℓj,…,𝐞mℓjℓjℓj]=[𝐞11,…,𝐞m111,…,𝐞1ℓj,…,𝐞mℓjℓjℓj]⁢Λj,
	

where Λj is an N⁢(λj)×N⁢(λj) matrix constituted of ℓj Jordan blocks and

	
N⁢(λj)=∑k=1ℓjmkj.
	

Proposition 2.2. For all 1≤j≤Nu, let

	
{𝚽ik⁢(λ¯j):k=1,…,ℓj,i=1,…,mkj},
	

be a canonical system of G*⁢(λ¯j). There exists a canonical system of G⁢(λj)

	
{𝐞ik⁢(λj):k=1,…,ℓj,i=1,…,mkj}
	

such that

	
Πu𝝃=∑j=1NuΠG(λj)𝝃, where ΠG⁢(λj)f=∑k=1ej∑i=1mkj(𝝃,𝚽mkj+1-ik(λ¯j))𝐘𝐞ik(λj).
	

Moreover,

	
(𝐞i1k1⁢(λj1),𝚽i2k2⁢(λ¯j2))𝐘=δj1j2⁢δk1k2⁢δmk1i1+1-i1i2
	

for all j1,j2∈{1,…,Nu},k1∈{1,…,ℓj1},k2∈{1,…,ℓj2},i1∈{1,…,mk1j1},i2∈{1,…,mk2j2}. In the above setting (⋅,⋅)𝐘 denotes the inner product in the complex space 𝐘. For a proof of this proposition, we refer to [17, Theorem 3.1], [18, 19], [32, Lemma 3.1]. We have a similar result when the role of G⁢(λj) and G*⁢(λ¯j) are changed. The operator Bu in (2.1) may be expressed as follows:

	
Bu⁢𝐮=∑j=1Nu∑k=1ℓj∑i=1mkj(𝐮,B*⁢𝚽mkj+1-ik⁢(λ¯j))𝐔⁢𝐞ik⁢(λj).
	

Here (⋅,⋅)𝐔 denotes the inner product in the complex space 𝐔. We notice that condition (v) in Theorem 1.4 is equivalent to the condition for all j=1,…,Nu, the family {B*⁢𝚽1k⁢(λ¯j):k=1,…,ℓj} is linearly independent. Since the operator A is defined in a real Hilbert space and knowing that λ is an eigenvalue of A if and only if λ¯ is an eigenvalue of A*, we have that A and A* have the same eigenvalues. Thus condition (2.3) is equivalent to for all j=1,…,Nu, the family {B*⁢𝚽1k⁢(λj):k=1,…,ℓj} is linearly independent.

804 J.-P. Raymond, Stabilizability of Infinite-Dimensional Systems DE GRUYTER With the notation above introduced, the complex space of actuators 𝐖 and of the real space of actuators W introduced in (1.13) and (1.12) may be defined by

W=spanℝ⁡{Re⁡B*⁢𝚽1k⁢(λ¯j),Im⁡B*⁢𝚽1k⁢(λ¯j):k=1,…,ℓj,j=1,…,Nu}.
	

We introduce the operators 𝔹u=Πu⁢𝔹 and 𝔹ℂ,u=Πu⁢𝔹ℂ, and we state below stabilizability conditions for the projected systems onto Yu and 𝐘u. The definitions of the FCC for the pair (Au,Bu) in Yu or in 𝐘u can be adapted from those stated in Definition 1.1. This theorem will be helpful to prove Theorem 1.4.

Theorem 2.3. Assume that assumptions (1.2) and (1.3) are satisfied, and that (λj)1≤j≤Nu is the family of eigenvalues of the operator A satisfying (1.11). Then the following conditions are equivalent: (v) For all 1≤j≤Nu, Ker⁡(λ¯j⁢I-A*)∩Ker⁡(B*)={0}. (xii) The pair (Au,Bu) satisfies the FCC in 𝐘u, with controls in 𝐔 and with the prescribed exponential decay rate ω≥0. (xiii) The pair (Au,Bu) satisfies the FCC in Yu, with controls in U and with the prescribed exponential decay rate ω≥0. (xiv) For all 1≤j≤Nu,Ker⁡(λ¯j⁢I-Au*)∩Ker⁡(𝔹u*)={0}. (xv) For all 1≤j≤Nu, Ker⁡(λ¯j⁢I-Au*)∩Ker⁡(𝔹ℂ,u*)={0}. Proof. We divide the proof into three steps. Step 1. If 1≤j≤Nu and 𝚽∈Ker⁡(λ¯j⁢I-A*), then 𝚽∈𝐘u* and B*⁢𝚽=Bu*⁢𝚽. Thus, we have For all 1≤j≤Nu,Ker⁡(λ¯j⁢I-A*)∩Ker⁡(B*)=Ker⁡(λ¯j⁢I-Au*)∩Ker⁡(Bu*). The equivalences between (v),(xii) and (xiii) follow from Proposition 1.3 applied to the pair (Au,Bu) and either the state space 𝐘u or the state space Yu, and the above identity.

Step 2. Let us prove that (v) is equivalent to (xv). We first prove that (v) implies (xv). Let Φj0 belong to Ker⁡(λ¯j0⁢I-A*) and satisfy 𝔹ℂ,u*⁢Φj0=0 for some 1≤j0≤Nu. We notice that 𝔹ℂ*⁢Φj0=𝔹ℂ,u*⁢Φj0=0. We have to show that Φj0=0. The operator 𝔹ℂ*∈ℒ⁢(D⁢(A*),ℂNc) is defined by

	
𝔹ℂ*⁢Φ=((𝐰i,B*⁢Φ)𝐔)1≤i≤Nc
	

From the definitions of 𝔹ℂ* and 𝐖, it follows that B*⁢Φj0=0. From the Hautus criterion in (v), it follows that Φj0=0 and the proof is complete.

Let us now show that (xv) implies (v). Let us argue by contradiction. We assume that there exists Φj0∈Ker⁡(λ¯j0⁢I-A*) for some 1≤j0≤Nu,Φj0≠0, such that B*⁢Φj0=0. Due to the definition of 𝐖 in (2.4), it follows that 𝔹ℂ*⁢Φj0=0, which implies that Φj0=0 since the pair (A,𝔹ℂ) satisfies the Hautus criterion (xv). We clearly have a contradiction and (v) is proved.

Step 3. Let us prove that (v) is equivalent to (xiv). We first prove that (v) implies (xiv). Let Φj belong to Ker⁡(λ¯j⁢I-A*), for some 1≤j≤Nu, and satisfy 𝔹*⁢Φj=0. To prove (xiv), we have to show that Φj=0. From the definitions of 𝔹ℂ,u*⁢Φj=𝔹*⁢Φj and W in (2.4), it follows that B*⁢Φj=0. From the Hautus criterion in (v), it follows that Φj0=0 and the proof is complete.

Now, we prove that (xiv) implies (v). To prove (v), we argue by contradiction. We assume that there exists Φj0∈Ker⁡(λj0⁢I-A*) for some 1≤j0≤Nu,Φj0≠0, such that B*⁢Φj0=0. In particular, we have

	
B*⁢Re⁡Φj0=Re⁡B*⁢Φj0=0  and  B*⁢Im⁡Φj0=Im⁡B*⁢Φj0=0
	

The operator 𝔹*∈ℒ⁢(D⁢(A*),ℝN) is defined by

	
𝔹*⁢Φ=((wi,B*⁢Φ)U)1≤i≤N.
	

It follows that 𝔹*⁢Re⁡Φj0=𝔹u*⁢Re⁡Φj0=0 and 𝔹*⁢Im⁡Φj0=𝔹u*⁢Im⁡Φj0=0, which implies that Re Φj0=0 and Im⁡Φj0=0 since the pair (Au,𝔹u) satisfies the Hautus criterion (xiv). We have a contradiction and (v) is proved.

DE GRUYTER J.-P. Raymond, Stabilizability of Infinite-Dimensional Systems ⟶𝟖𝟎𝟓 2.2 Proofs of the Main Results Proof of Proposition 1.5. It follows from Theorem 2.3 and from the following identities: For all 1≤j≤Nu,

	
Ker⁡(λ¯j⁢I-A*)∩Ker⁡(𝔹*)=Ker⁡(λ¯j⁢I-Au*)∩Ker⁡(𝔹u*)
	

and

	
Ker⁡(λ¯j⁢I-A*)∩Ker⁡(𝔹ℂ*)=Ker⁡(λ¯j⁢I-Au*)∩Ker⁡(𝔹ℂ,u*)
	

Proof of Theorem 1.4. The proof is divided into ten steps. Step 1: (iv) ⇒(v). Due to (iv), the pair (A,𝔹ℂ) also satisfies the FCC in (D⁢(A*))′ with controls in ℂNc and with the prescribed exponential decay rate ω≥0. Let us notice that all the assumptions of Proposition 1.3 are satisfied by the pair (A,𝔹ℂ) with the state space (D⁢(A*))′ and the control space ℂNc. Therefore the pair (A,𝔹ℂ) satisfies the Hautus criterion:

	
Ker⁡(λ¯j⁢I-A*)∩Ker⁡(𝔹ℂ*)={0}  for all ⁢1≤j≤Nu
	

Due to Proposition 1.5,(2.5) is equivalent to (v), and the proof is complete. Step 2: (iii) ⇒(v). Due to (iii), the pair (A,𝔹) also satisfies the FCC in (D⁢(A*))′ with controls in ℝN and with the prescribed exponential decay rate ω≥0. Therefore, due to Proposition 1.3, the pair (A,𝔹) satisfies the Hautus criterion

	
Ker⁡(λ¯j⁢I-A*)∩Ker⁡(𝔹*)={0}  for all ⁢1≤j≤Nu
	

According to Proposition 1.5,(2.6) is equivalent to (v), and the proof is complete. Step 3: (v) ⇒ (iv). We first consider the projected system

	
𝐲u′=Au⁢𝐲u+∑i=1N𝐟i⁢(t)⁢Bu⁢𝐰i=Au⁢𝐲u+𝔹ℂ,u⁢𝐟⁢(t),𝐲u⁢(0)=Πu⁢𝐲0,
	

where 𝔹ℂ,u=Πu⁢𝔹ℂ. From Theorem 2.3, it follows that the Hautus criterion (xv) is satisfied. Thus the Riccati equation

	
𝐏∈ℒ⁢(𝐘u,𝐘u*),𝐏=𝐏*>0,𝐏⁢(Au+ω⁢Πu)+(Au*+ω⁢Πu*)⁢𝐏-𝐏⁢𝔹ℂ,u⁢𝔹ℂ,u*⁢𝐏+Πu*⁢Πu=0
	

admits a unique solution, and there exists ε>0 such that

	
∥et⁢(Au+𝔹ℂ,u⁢𝕂)∥ℒ⁢(𝐘u)≤C⁢e-(ω+ε)⁢t
	

where 𝕂=-𝔹ℂ,u*⁢𝐏⁢Πu. Let 𝐲u be the solution to the closed loop system

	
𝐲u′=(Au+𝔹ℂ,u⁢𝕂)⁢𝐲u,𝐲u⁢(0)=Πu⁢𝐲0
	

Due to (2.8), we have

	
∥e(ω+ε)⁣⋅⁢𝐲u∥L2⁢(0,∞;𝐘u)⁢<∞  and ∥⁢e(ω+ε)⁣⋅⁢𝕂⁢𝐲u∥L2⁢(0,∞;ℂNc)<∞
	

Now we consider the system

	
𝐲s′=As⁢𝐲s+Πs⁢𝔹ℂ⁢𝕂⁢𝐲u,𝐲s⁢(0)=Πs⁢𝐲0
	

The function eω⁣⋅⁢𝐲s satisfies

	
(eω⁢t⁢𝐲S)′=(As+ω⁢I)⁢(eω⁢t⁢𝐲S)+ΠS⁢𝔹ℂ⁢𝕂⁢eω⁢t⁢𝐲u,𝐲S⁢(0)=Πs⁢𝐲0
	

From (2.2), it follows that (et⁢(As+ω⁢Πs))t≥0 is an exponentially stable and analytic semigroup on (D⁢(A*))′. Thus, from [12, Theorem 2.1, Chapter 3, Part I], (2.9) and (2.10), it follows that

	
∥eω⁣⋅⁢𝐲S∥L2⁢(0,∞;𝐘)<∞
	

The proof of (iv) is complete.

806 J.-P. Raymond, Stabilizability of Infinite-Dimensional Systems DE GRUYTER Step 4: (v) ⇒ (iii). This can be proved by adapting to the real system what is done in Step 3 for the complexified system.

Step 5: (v) ⇔ (vi). We first prove that (v) ⇒(vi). In Step 3, we have proved that the solution 𝐲𝐲0 to the closed loop system

	
𝐲′=A⁢𝐲+𝔹ℂ⁢𝕂⁢𝐲,𝐲⁢(0)=𝐲0,
	

obeys

	
∥eω⁣⋅⁢𝐲𝐲0∥L2⁢(0,∞;𝐘)<∞
	

Actually, we can prove that the mapping

	
𝐲0↦eω⁣⋅⁢𝐲𝐲0⁢(⋅)
	

is continuous from 𝐘 into L2⁢(0,∞;𝐘). In addition, eω⁣⋅⁢𝐲𝐲0⁢(⋅) belongs to Cb⁢([0,∞);(D⁢(A*))′). For that, it is enough to prove that the mapping

	
t↦𝐳⁢(t)=eω⁢t⁢∫0teAs⁢(t-τ)⁢Πs⁢𝔹ℂ⁢𝕂u⁢(τ)⁢𝑑τ
	

where 𝐲u⁢(t)=et⁢(Au+𝔹𝒞,u⁢𝕂)⁢Πu⁢𝐲0, is bounded and continuous from [0,∞) into (D⁢(A*))′. Using (2.2) and estimates for convolution product, we can write

	
∥𝐳⁢(t)∥(D⁢(A*))′≤C⁢∫0te-δ⁢(t-τ)⁢∥eω⁢τ⁢𝕂⁢𝐲u⁢(τ)∥ℂNc⁢𝑑τ≤C⁢∥e-δ⁣⋅∥L2⁢(0,∞)⁢∥eω⁢(⋅)⁢𝕂⁢𝐲u∥L2⁢(0,∞;ℂNc)
	

With (2.9), we have that 𝐳 belongs to L∞⁢(0,∞;(D⁢(A*))′). The continuity of 𝐳 is obvious. Thus with (2.11) and Datko’s Theorem, we obtain

	
∥et⁢(A+𝔹𝒞⁢𝕂)∥ℒ⁢((D⁢(A*))′)≤C⁢e-(ω+ε)⁢t  for some ⁢ε>0⁢. 
	

Hence (A,𝔹ℂ) is stabilizable by feedback in (D⁢(A*))′ with the prescribed exponential decay rate ω≥0. To prove that (vi) ⇒(v), it is enough to apply Propositions 1.3 and 1.5. Step 6: (v)⇒ (vii). The proof is very similar to that in Step 4 and is left to the reader. Step 7: (i) ⇒(v). Due to (i), the pair (A,B) also satisfies the FCC in (D⁢(A*))′ with controls in U and with the prescribed exponential decay rate ω≥0. According to Proposition 1.3, the Hautus criterion (v) is satisfied. Step 8: (v) ⇒ (i). We already know that (v) implies (iii) (Step 4). It is obvious that (iii) implies (i). Thus (v) implies (i).

Step 9: We prove the equivalence (v)⇔( viii) for the real system. The same equivalence can be proved similarly for the complexified system. We first notice that (v) ⇒ (vi) (Step 4) and that (vi) ⇒ (viii) (obvious). To prove the reverse statement, we notice that (viii) ⇒ (xiii). Indeed, if A+B⁢K+ω⁢I is exponentially stable in (D⁢(A*))′, then ∥e(ω+ε)⋅e(A+B⁢K)⁣⋅⁢yu,0∥(D⁢(A*))′≤C⁢∥yu,0∥Yu  for all yu,0∈Yu The function yu=Πu⁢y satisfies the system

	
yu′=Au⁢yu+Bu⁢K⁢y,yu⁢(0)=yu,0,
	

and the estimate

	
∥e(ω+ε)⋅yu⁢(⋅)∥Yu≤C⁢∥yu,0∥Yu  for all ⁢yu,0∈Yu⁢. 
	

Thus (xiii) is proved with the control u=K⁢y. From Theorem 2.3, we have (xiii) ⇒(v). The proof is complete. Step 10: (ii) ⇒ (v). This can be proved as in Steps 7 and 8. Proof of Theorems 1.6. Due to (1.4) and the definitions of 𝔹 and 𝔹ℂ, we have

DE GRUYTER J.-P. Raymond, Stabilizability of Infinite-Dimensional Systems - 807 where 0<α≤1 and λ0>0 are the constants appearing in (1.4). As in Step 3 of the proof of Theorem 1.4, we set 𝕂=-𝔹ℂ,u*⁢𝐏⁢Πu, where 𝐏 is the solution to (2.7). Let us prove that if assumption (1.4) is satisfied, then the mapping

	
t↦𝐳⁢(t)=eω⁢t⁢∫0teAs⁢(t-τ)⁢Πs⁢𝔹ℂ⁢𝕂u⁢(τ)⁢𝑑τ,
	

where eω⁢t⁢𝐲u⁢(t)=et⁢(Au+𝔹c,u⁢𝕂+ω⁢I)⁢Πu⁢𝐲0, is bounded and continuous from [0, ∞) into 𝐘. For that, using (2.12), (2.2), estimates for analytic semigroups and estimates for convolution product, we can write

	∥𝐳⁢(t)∥𝐘	≤∫0t∥eAs⁢(t-τ)⁢(λ0⁢I-A)1-α∥ℒ⁢(𝐘)∥(λ0⁢I-A)α-1⁢Πs	
		≤C⁢∫0te-δ⁢(t-τ)(t-τ)1-α⁢∥eω⁢τ⁢𝐲u⁢(τ)∥𝐘⁢𝑑τ	
		≤C⁢∥e-δ⁢(t-τ)(t-τ)1-α∥L22-α⁢(0,∞)⁢∥eω⁢(⋅)⁢𝐲u∥L2α⁢(0,∞;𝐘)	

Thus 𝐳 belongs to L∞⁢(0,∞;𝐘). We can next show that 𝐳 belongs to Cb⁢([0,∞);𝐘). Thus A+𝔹ℂ⁢𝕂, with domain D⁢(A+𝔹ℂ⁢𝕂)={𝐲∈𝐘:A+𝔹ℂ⁢𝕂⁢𝐲∈𝐘}, is the infinitesimal generator of a strongly continuous semigroup on 𝐘. To prove that (et⁢(A+𝔹𝒞⁢𝕂⁢Πu+ω⁢I))⁢t≥0 is exponentially stable, it is sufficient to prove that t↦et⁢(A+𝔹C⁢𝕂u+ω⁢I)⁢𝐲0 belongs to L2⁢(0,∞;𝐘). This can be proved as in Step 5 of the proof of Theorem 1.4. 3 Applications Many existing results in the literature are concerned with the boundary stabilization of the linearized Navier-Stokes with Dirichlet boundary conditions (see e.g. Badra [4-6], Barbu [9], Barbu, Lasiecka and Triggiani [10], Raymond [29, 30], Raymond and Thevenet [32], Badra and Takahashi [7, 8]). The case of mixed boundary conditions of Dirichlet/Neumann type is important for applications (see [1, 3]). In this section, we introduce a stabilizability result for the linearized Navier-Stokes system in the case of mixed boundary conditions. This result is obtained as a consequence of Theorem 1.6 and of a unique continuation result due to Fabre and Lebeau [13]. A similar result is proved in [27] for two-dimensional domains. Here, we consider the three-dimensional case. As far as we know, this case is not treated in the literature, even if the ingredients of the proof of stabilizability are similar to those introduced in [27] in the two-dimensional case. Let Ωe be the three-dimensional cylinder defined by

	
Ωe=(0,L)×{(x2,x3)∈ℝ2:x22+x32<R2}, with ⁢R>0.
	

Let 𝒪 be a bounded domain of class C2 such that 𝒪¯⊂Ωe, and set Ω=Ωe\𝒪¯. We set

	Γin	={0}×{(x2,x3)∈ℝ2:x22+x32<R2},	
	Γout	={0}×{(x2,x3)∈ℝ2:x22+x32<R2},	
	ΓR	=(0,L)×{(x2,x3)∈ℝ2:x22+x32=R2},	
	Γo	=∂⁡𝒪,	
	Γn	=ΓR∪Γout ,	
	Γd	=Γo∪Γin .	

Following [27], we set

	𝐕n,Γd0⁢(Ω)	={y∈L2⁢(Ω;ℝ3):div⁡y=0,y⋅n=0⁢ on ⁢Γd},	
	𝐕0⁢(Ω)	={y∈L2⁢(Ω;ℝ3):div⁡y=0},	
	𝐕Γd1⁢(Ω)	={y∈H1⁢(Ω;ℝ3)∩𝐕n,Γd0⁢(Ω):y|Γd=0}	




808 J.-P. Raymond, Stabilizability of Infinite-Dimensional Systems DE GRUYTER The following orthogonal decomposition in L2⁢(Ω;ℝ3) is well known:

	
L2⁢(Ω;ℝ3)=𝐕n,Γd0⁢(Ω)⊕∇⁡HΓn1⁢(Ω),
	

where HΓn1⁢(Ω)={p∈H1⁢(Ω):p|Γn=0}. The so-called Leray projector P is the orthogonal projector in L2⁢(Ω;ℝ3) onto 𝐕n,Γd0⁢(Ω). Let (zs,ps), a velocity and a pressure, satisfy the stationary incompressible Navier-Stokes equation (with a given right-hand side), Dirichlet (not necessarily homogeneous) boundary conditions on Γin ∪Γo, and Neumann (not necessarily homogeneous) boundary conditions on Γn. Our goal is to study the stabilizability of the following linearized system around (zs,ps), with a boundary control u :

	
∂⁡y∂⁡t-v⁢Δ⁢y+(zs⋅∇)⁢y+(y⋅∇)⁢zs+∇⁡p=0  in ⁢Q
div⁡y=0  in ⁢Q,y=m⁢u  on ⁢Σd,σ⁢(y,p)⁢n=0  on ⁢Σn
P⁢y⁢(0)=P⁢y0  in ⁢Ω.
	

In this setting σ⁢(y,p)=v⁢((∇⁡y)+(∇⁡y)T)-p⁢I is the Cauchy stress tensor, Q=Ω×(0,∞),Σd=Γd×(0,∞), Σn=Γn×(0,∞), and m∈C2⁢(Γd) takes values in [0,1],m|Γin =0 and m|Γc=1, where Γc is a relatively open subset in Γo. As noticed in [31], since m⁢u⋅n may be different from zero, the solution y to (3.1) does not belong to 𝐕n,Γd0⁢(Ω) and P⁢y⁢(t)≠y⁢(t). This is why the initial condition has to be stated for P⁢y and not for y.

System (3.1) is a prototype for stabilizing a fluid flow around an obstacle 𝒪. The homogeneous Neumann boundary condition on Σn is known as the do nothing boundary condition, and is used to approximate a fluid flow in an unbounded domain when Γn is far from the obstacle 𝒪, and Γin  may be used to prescribe a velocity in the equation satisfied by (zs,ps) and also inflow boundary perturbations in the equation satisfied by (y,p). Here, for simplicity, we have not included inflow perturbations in system (3.1).

Our goal is to show that Theorem 1.6 may be used to prove that system (3.1) is stabilizable by feedbacks of finite dimension with an arbitrary exponential decay rate ω>0. We assume that

	
zS∈H32+ε0⁢(Ω;ℝ3)∩𝐕0⁢(Ω),ps∈H12+ε0⁢(Ω;ℝ)  for some ⁢ε0>0.
	

For the geometrical domain Ω with Dirichlet boundary conditions on Γd and Neumann boundary conditions on Γn, this type of regularity result is proved in [25, Chapter 9] for the Stokes system and it can be proved a posteriori for the stationary Navier-Stokes system as in [27]. We set

	
a(y,ϕ)=∫Ω(v∇y:∇ϕ+[λ0y+(zs⋅∇)y+(y⋅∇)zs]⋅ϕ)dx
	

and we choose a real number λ0>0 large enough so that

	
a⁢(y,ϕ)≥v2⁢∫Ω|y|2⁢𝑑x  for all ⁢y∈𝐕Γd1⁢(Ω)
	

We define the unbounded operator (A,D⁢(A)) in 𝐕n,Γd0⁢(Ω) by

	
D⁢(A)={y∈𝐕Γd1⁢(Ω):ϕ↦a⁢(y,ϕ)⁢ is continuous in ⁢𝐕n,Γd0⁢(Ω)}
∫Ω(λ0⁢I-A)⁢y⁢ϕ⁢𝑑x=a⁢(y,ϕ)  for all ⁢y∈D⁢(A)⁢ and all ⁢ϕ∈𝐕Γd1⁢(Ω).
	

We also introduce the adjoint bilinear form

	
a*⁢(ϕ,y)=a⁢(y,ϕ)  for all ⁢y∈𝐕Γd1⁢(Ω)⁢ and all ⁢ϕ∈𝐕Γd1⁢(Ω),
	

and (A*,D⁢(A*)), the adjoint of (A,D⁢(A)), is defined by

	
D⁢(A*)={ϕ∈𝐕Γd1⁢(Ω):y↦a*⁢(ϕ,y)⁢ is continuous in ⁢𝐕n,Γd0⁢(Ω)},
∫Ω(λ0⁢I-A*)⁢ϕ⁢y⁢𝑑x=a*⁢(ϕ,y)  for all ⁢ϕ∈D⁢(A*)⁢ and all ⁢y∈𝐕Γd1⁢(Ω).
	




DE GRUYTER J.-P. Raymond, Stabilizability of Infinite-Dimensional Systems - 809 Let us notice that the bilinear form a* can be extended to a bilinear form in HΓd1(Ω;ℂ3)×HΓd1(Ω; ℂ3), where HΓd1⁢(Ω;ℂ3)={𝐲∈H1⁢(Ω;ℂ3):𝐲|Γd=0}, by setting

	
a*(𝚽,𝐲)=∫Ω(v∇𝚽:∇⁡𝐲¯+[λ0𝚽-(zs⋅∇)𝚽+(∇zs)T𝚽]⋅𝐲¯)dx.
	

We set U=L2⁢(Γd;ℝ3), and we introduce the Dirichlet operator G∈ℒ⁢(U,V0⁢(Ω)) defined by G⁢u=y, where

	
λ0⁢y-v⁢Δ⁢y+(zs⋅∇)⁢y+(y⋅∇)⁢zS+∇⁡p=0  in ⁢Ω,
div⁡y=0 y=u  in ⁢Ω,y=u,σ⁢(y,p)⁢n=0  on ⁢Γd,Γn.
	

Following [27], we introduce the operator B∈ℒ⁢(U,(D⁢(A*))′) defined by

	
B=(λ0⁢I-A)⁢P⁢G⁢M,
	

where M∈ℒ⁢(U) is defined by M⁢u=m⁢u. The pair⁡(A,B) satisfies (1.2) and (1.4) for all 0≤α<14. As in [27], we can show that a function y∈L2⁢(0,T;H1⁢(Ω;ℝ3))∩L∞⁢(0,T;L2⁢(Ω;ℝ3)) is a weak solution to equation (3.1) if and only if (P⁢y,(I-P)⁢y) satisfies the system

	
P⁢y′	=A⁢P⁢y+B⁢u  in ⁢(D⁢(A*))′,P⁢y⁢(0)=P⁢y0,	
(I-P)⁢y	=(I-P)⁢G⁢u	 in ⁢V0⁢(Ω).
	

Thus to stabilize system (3.1) it is necessary and sufficient to stabilize equation (3.3a). We can verify that assumptions (1.2)-(1.4) are satisfied by the pair (A,B) for all 0≤α<14 (see [27]), and Theorem 1.6 applies to prove the stabilizability of equation (3.3a), that is of the pair (A,B), in the state space 𝐕n,Γd0⁢(Ω). The operator B*∈ℒ⁢(D⁢(A*),U), the adjoint of B, is defined by (see [27])

	
B*=M⁢G*⁢(λ0⁢I-A*)⁢. 
	

In order to verify the Hautus criterion, we introduce the adjoint eigenvalue problem: Problem 3.1. Find λ∈ℂ,𝚽∈H1⁢(Ω;ℂ3) and Ψ∈L2⁢(Ω;ℂ) such that

	
λ⁢𝚽-v⁢Δ⁢𝚽-(zS⋅∇)⁢𝚽+(∇⁡zs)T⁢𝚽+∇⁡𝚿=0  in ⁢Ω,
div⁡𝚽=0  in ⁢Ω,𝚽=0  on ⁢Γd,σ⁢(𝚽,𝚿)⁢n+zs⋅n⁢𝚽=0  on ⁢Γn.
	

If (λ,𝚽,ψ) is a solution of (3.4), then we have (see [27])

	
B*⁢𝚽=(m⁢v⁢∂⁡𝚽∂⁡n-m⁢𝚿⁢n)|Γc.
	

It can be shown that a pair (λ,𝚽,ψ)∈ℂ×H1⁢(Ω;ℂ3)×L2⁢(Ω;ℂ) is a solution to (3.4) if and only if (λ,𝚽,Ψ) solves the following problem: Problem 3.2. Find λ∈ℂ,𝚽∈D⁢(A*) and 𝚿∈L2⁢(Ω;ℂ) such that

	
(λ⁢I-A*)⁢𝚽=0,
-Δ⁢𝚿=div⁡((zs⋅∇)⁢𝚽-(∇⁡zs)T⁢𝚽)⁢ in ⁢Ω,
𝚿=-zs⋅n⁢𝚽⋅n+v⁢((∇⁡𝚽+(∇⁡𝚽)T)⁢n)⋅n  on ⁢Γn,
∂⁡𝚿∂⁡n=-λ⁢𝚽⋅n+v⁢Δ⁢𝚽⋅n+(zs⋅∇)⁢𝚽⋅n-(∇⁡zs)T⁢𝚽⋅n.
	

Due to the presence of mixed boundary conditions, the solution 𝚽 to (3.4) belongs to H32+ε0⁢(Ω;ℂ3) or to a weighted Sobolev space (see [25, Theorem 9.4.5]), but not to H2⁢(Ω;ℂ3). Thus the term v⁢Δ⁢𝚽⋅n in the boundary condition (3.5d) is not well defined. The solution to (3.5) can be defined by a transposition method as in [16] for the two-dimensional case or in [24, Proposition 4.5] for the three-dimensional case.

The pressure 𝚿 can be defined by an alternative approach. Once we know that (𝚽,λ) is the solution to (3.5a), the pressure 𝚿 can be characterized by noting that (𝚽,𝚿) is the unique solution to the following mixed variational problem.

810 J.-P. Raymond, Stabilizability of Infinite-Dimensional Systems DE GRUYTER Problem 3.3. Find 𝚽∈HΓd1⁢(Ω;ℂ3) and 𝚿∈L2⁢(Ω;ℂ) such that

	
a*⁢(𝚽,𝐲)-∫Ω𝚿⁢div⁡𝐲¯⁢𝑑x=(λ0-λ)⁢∫Ω𝚽⋅𝐲¯⁢𝑑x  for all ⁢𝐲∈HΓd1⁢(Ω;ℂ3)
∫Ωξ⁢𝐝𝐢𝐯⁡𝚽¯⁢𝑑x=0  for all ⁢𝝃∈L2⁢(Ω;ℂ)
	

Since the right-hand side in (3.6⁢a) is known, the existence and uniqueness of the solution to the mixed variational formulation can be obtained by adapting to the Oseen system what is done in [25, Chapter 9] for the Stokes system.

Assume that (λ¯j)1≤j≤Nu are the eigenvalues of systems (3.4) or (3.5) with real part greater than or equal to -ω. Let us denote by ((𝚽1k⁢(λ¯j),Ψ1k⁢(λ¯j)))1≤k≤ej the solutions to system (3.4) corresponding to λ¯j and constituting a basis of the corresponding eigenspace. Using Theorem 1.6, it can be shown that if, for all 1≤j≤Nu, the family

	
{(v⁢∂⁡𝚽1k⁢(λ¯j)∂⁡n-𝚿1k⁢(λ¯j)⁢n)|Γc:k=1,…,ℓj}
	

is linearly independent, then system (3.2) is stabilizable by feedback with the prescribed exponential decay rate ω. To verify the linear independence condition stated in (3.7) for all 1≤j≤Nu, we argue by contradiction. We assume that there exist 1≤j0≤Nu and a non-zero function 𝚽∈Ker⁡(λ¯j0⁢I-A*) such that

	
(v⁢∂⁡𝚽∂⁡n-𝚿⁢n)|Γc=0
	

where Ψ is the pressure associated with 𝚽. The pair (𝚽,𝚿) obeys

	
λ¯j0⁢𝚽-v⁢Δ⁢𝚽-(zs⋅∇)⁢𝚽+(∇⁡zs)T⁢𝚽+∇⁡𝚿=0  in ⁢Ω
div⁡𝚽=0 in⁡Ω,𝚽=0,v⁢∂⁡𝚽∂⁡n-𝚿⁢n=0  on ⁢Γc
	

Using an extension procedure and a unique continuation result from [13], we deduce that the solution 𝚽 to (3.8) is zero. We get a contradiction and the stabilizability of (A,B) by feedback in 𝐕n,Γd0⁢(Ω) with the prescribed exponential decay rate ω is proved. The stabilizability by feedback of finite dimension, with W defined by (1.12), follows from Theorem 1.6.",1422.93158.tex,1432.93263.tex,None; Paraphrase
"5.5. Two internal non-colinear cracks A rectangular plate (90⁢mm×180⁢mm) with two internal, parallel, non-colinear and non-angled cracks (length =10⁢mm for both) is submitted to a cyclic tension (σmax=160N/mm,σmin= 0 ) at both ends. The horizontal distance between the two tips close to each other is 15⁢mm and the vertical distance is 5⁢mm. The material properties are the same as in the previous section. We use a regular set of 19×37 nodes plus 2 nodes on each side of both the initial cracks (radius =8.5⁢mm ) and the three enriched nodes at each crack tip. When the crack grows, the enriched nodes move and regular nodes are added as in Section 5.4. The maximum crack increment length Δ⁢amax is equal to 2⁢mm. The radius of the support of the enriched nodes at each tip is equal to the increment of the crack of the previous step at this tip. The integration is performed on 18×36 cells, with again 8×8 Gauss points in each cell.

The evolution of the SIFs at the most interior crack tip (A) and at the crack tip near the edge (B) with the crack length is plotted in Figure 9. The fatigue-life diagram and the crack paths are presented in Figures 10 and 11, respectively. In the beginning, it is a pure mode I state and the SIFs at A and B are about the same. Then, mode I factor at A increases quicker than at B and mode II factor at A becomes negative so that the crack paths curve towards the other crack. But, when the crack tips A overlap, the stress intensity factors tend to decrease, while mode I factor increases continuously at B. Finally, the equivalent mode I SIF at B exceeds the fracture toughness and unstable fracture occurs at the crack tips B. This prediction of the fatigue crack growth path is in good agreement with the experimental results reported in Reference [23]. The life of the structure is evaluated as 6792 cycles, which is in good agreement with Reference [3]. Copyright (c) 2004 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd. Int. J. Numer. Meth. Engng 2004; 59:1945-1961

MESHLESS METHOD WITH ENRICHED WEIGHT FUNCTIONS 1959 Figure 10. Fatigue-life diagram for the ’two internal cracks’ problem. Figure 11. Crack path for the ’two internal cracks’ problem.","7 6.3 Interacting cracks

In this section, we consider interacting flaw problems. Figure 2 illustrates the test-set up of two specimen with 2 parallel internal flaws. The specimen are loaded under uni-axial tension where tractions are applied on top and on the bottom of the two plates. The specimen in Fig. 2b is subject to cyclic loading while the specimen in Fig. 2a is not. Hence, we used Paris’ law for specimen 2⁢b.

We focus on the latter problem first and consider two combinations of H and S; i.e. H=S=15⁢cm and H=S=20⁢cm. Experimental data is reported in [44]. They report that for H=S=15⁢mm, the two cracks join while for H=S=20⁢mm, the lower crack propagates straight while no propagation was observed for the upper crack [44]. We were able to reproduce the same crack pattern with our enriched method. The crack patterns are shown in Figs. 5 and 4 . The principal stress distribution is shown in Fig. 6. The evolution of the SIFs, that will explain Fig. 4, are shown in Fig. 7. For H=S=15⁢mm, the evolution of the SIFs at the most interior crack tip, point A (Fig. 2) and at the crack tip near the edge, point B, shows that in the beginning, pure mode I fracture is present at both points. Then at point A, mode II SIF becomes negative and the cracks start to curve towards each other. For H=S=20⁢mm, the mode II SIF remains nearly zero. Therefore, the crack propagates straight. The maximum crack opening over the crack length is illustrated in Fig. 8. Crack opening is non-linear and more severe for the single propagating crack.

For the specimen 2⁢b under cyclic loading, the two cracks are curving towards each other as well. This is expected since the distance between the cracks are smaller as compared to the one of specimen 2a. Note that the crack is represented by straight crack segments. Hence, a certain refinement is needed in or-

"1. Introduction In this paper we are concerned with the following differential system with state-dependent delays

	
{x1⁢(t)′=-F⁢(x1⁢(t))+G⁢(x2⁢(t-r2)),r2=r2⁢(x2⁢(t-δ2))
x2⁢(t)′=-F⁢(x2⁢(t))+G⁢(x1⁢(t-r1)),r1=r1⁢(x1⁢(t-δ1))
	

where ri:𝐑1→(0,∞) is a continuous function, δi>0 is a constant, i=1,2.F,G∈C⁢(𝐑1) and either G⁢(x)≥F⁢(x) for all x∈R1 or G⁢(x)≤F⁢(x) for all x∈𝐑1.

To motivate the problem we are going to investigate, and to provide a brief account of the history of the subject, let us start with the scalar delay differential equation:

	
x′⁢(t)=-F⁢(x⁢(t))+F⁢(x⁢(t-r)),r=r⁢(x⁢(t-δ)),
	

with r≡1 appears in several applications (see [1,2]). When r is a constant, Eq. (1.2) has been extensively studied (see, for example, [2,3], and the references cited therein) because of their applications in modelling population growth, the spread of epidemics, the dynamics of capital stocks and so on. Over the past several years it has become apparent that equations with state-dependent delay arise in several areas such as in classical electrodynamics [4], in population models [5], in models of commodity price fluctuations [6], and in models of blood cell productions [7]. Recently, it was shown in [8] that each bounded solution of Eq. (1.2) tends to a constant as t→∞ under the assumption that F is strictly increasing.

L. Wang / Journal of Computational and Applied Mathematics 228 (2009) 226-230 227 Now, a corresponding question arises: can we show every bounded solution of system (1.1) tends to a constant vector as t→∞ provided F is strictly increasing on 𝐑1. The main purpose of this paper is to discuss the asymptotic behavior of bounded solutions of system (1.1). It is worth noting that system (1.1) include Eq. (1.2) as a special case. In fact, if F≡G,r1=r2=r and consider the synchronized solutions of (1.1) with x1⁢(t)=x2⁢(t)=φ⁢(t) for t∈(-∞,0], then system (1.1) reduces to Eq. (1.2). By using monotonicity arguments in this work, we show that, assuming that F strictly increasing on 𝐑1 and some additional conditions hold, every bounded solution of system (1.1) is convergent to a constant vector. Our approach is quite different from those of [3,8] and our results are new.

The paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, we introduce some necessary notations and establish some preliminary results, which are important in the proofs of our main results. Based on the preparations in Section 2, we state and prove our main results in Section 3.","1. Introduction Consider the scalar differential equation with state-dependent delay

	
x′⁢(t)=-F⁢(x⁢(t))+F⁢(x⁢(t-r)),r=r⁢(x⁢(t-δ)),
	

where r:𝐑1→(0,∞) is a continuous function, δ>0 is a constant, F∈C⁢(R1). When r is a constant, Eq. (1.1) has been extensively studied (see, for example, [1-3], and the references cited therein) because of their applications in modeling population growth, the spread of epidemics, the dynamics of capital stocks, a single neuron model and so on. Over the past several years it has become apparent that equations with state-dependent delay arise in several areas such as in classical electrodynamics [4], in population models [5], in models of commodity price fluctuations [6], and in models of blood cell productions [7]. Recently, it was shown in Terjéki and Bartha [8] that each bounded solution of Eq. (1.1) tends to a constant as t→∞ under the assumption that F is strictly increasing.

Now, a corresponding question arises: can we show every bounded solution of Eq. (1.1) tends to a constant as t→∞ provided F is nondecreasing on R1. To reply the above question, we are concerned with the following differential equation with multiple state-dependent delays

	
x′⁢(t)=-F⁢(x⁢(t))+G⁢(x⁢(t-r1),x⁢(t-r2),…,x⁢(t-rn)),ri=ri⁢(x⁢(t-δi)),i=1,2,…,n
	

where ri:𝐑1→(0,∞) is a continuous function, δi>0 is a constant, F∈C⁢(R1),G∈C⁢(Rn) and i=1,2,…,n. Obviously, (1.1) is a special case of Eq.

W. Wang et al. / Journal of Computational and Applied Mathematics 233 (2009) 356-360 357 The main purpose of this paper is to discuss the asymptotic behavior of bounded solutions of Eq. (1.2). By using monotonicity arguments in this work, we show that, assuming that F is nondecreasing on R1 and some additional conditions hold, every bounded solution of Eq. (1.2) is convergent to a constant. Our approach is quite different from those of [3,8] and our results are new.

The paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, we introduce some necessary notations and establish some preliminary results, which are important in the proofs of our main results.

"2. Preliminary results In this section, some important properties of system (1.1) will be presented, which are of importance in proving our main results in Section 3.

Let C~=C⁢((-∞,0],𝐑1)×C⁢((-∞,0],𝐑1). We say that a function x=(x1,x2) with xi:𝐑1→𝐑1⁢(i=1,2) is a solution of system (1.1) through φ∈C~ if xi is continuous on 𝐑1,xi is differentiable on (0,∞), it satisfies system (1.1) for all t≥0, (x1|(-∞,0],x2|(-∞,0])=φ, and xi′⁢(0) denotes the right hand derivative of xi at 0 . Now, we consider the following differential system with state-dependent delays

	
{x1⁢(t)′=-F⁢(x1⁢(t))+G⁢(x2⁢(t-r¯2)),	r¯2=r¯2⁢(x2⁢(t-δ2))
x2⁢(t)′=-F⁢(x2⁢(t))+G⁢(x1⁢(t-r¯1)),	r¯1=r¯1⁢(x1⁢(t-δ1))
	

where r¯1:𝐑1→(0,∞) and r¯2:𝐑1→(0,∞) are bounded continuous functions, and

	
τi=max⁡{δi,supα∈𝐑1⁡r¯i⁢(α)}≥infα∈𝐑1⁡r¯i⁢(α)>0,i=1,2.
	

Let C=C⁢([-τ1,0],𝐑1)×C⁢([-τ2,0],𝐑1) be the phase space. We say that a function x=(x1,x2) with xi:[-τi,∞)→ 𝐑1⁢(i=1,2) is a solution of system (2.1) through φ∈C if xi is continuous on [-τi,∞),xi is differentiable on (0,∞), it satisfies system (2.1) for all t≥0,(x1|[-τ1,0],x2|[-τ2,0])=φ, and xi′⁢(0) denotes the right hand derivative of xi at 0 .

As pointed out in [8], all solutions x⁢(t) of system (1.1) do not tend to constant vectors when t→∞, since Eq. (1.2) may have unbounded solutions. We will show that the bounded solutions x⁢(t) of system (1.1) converge to constant vectors as t→∞. Let x⁢(t) be a bounded solution of system (1.1), then there exist positive constants A1,A2,M1 and M2 such that

	
-Ai≤xi⁢(t)≤Ai,Mi=sup-Ai≤xi≤Ai⁡ri⁢(xi)≥inf-Ai≤xi≤Ai⁡ri⁢(xi)>0,i=1,2.
	

Set

	
r¯i⁢(xi)={ri⁢(Ai),	xi≥Ai,
ri⁢(xi),	-Ai<xi<Ai,
ri⁢(-Ai),	xi≤-Ai,
	

and

	
τi=max⁡{δi,Mi}>0,i=1,2.
	

Then, x⁢(t) is a bounded solution of Eq. (2.1) with initial data

	
φ⁢(t)=(x1|[-τ1,0],x2|[-τ2,0])∈C=C⁢([-τ1,0],𝐑1)×C⁢([-τ2,0],𝐑1).
	

Therefore, to prove that the bounded solutions x⁢(t) of system (1.1) converge to constant vectors as t→∞, it is suffice to show the bounded solutions x⁢(t) of system (2.1) converge to constant vectors as t→∞.

In the sequel, 𝐑+1 denotes the set of all nonnegative real numbers. Let C⁢([-τ1,0],𝐑1)×C⁢([-τ2,0],𝐑1) be equipped with the supremum norm. Then, C=C⁢([-τ1,0],𝐑1)×C⁢([-τ2,0],𝐑1) is a Banach space. Define C+=C([-τ1,0],𝐑+1)× C⁢([-τ2,0],𝐑+1). It follows that C+is an order cone in the Banach space C and hence C+induces a closed partial ordered relation on C. For any φ,ψ∈C, we write φ≤ψ if ψ-φ∈C+,φ<ψ if φ≤ψ and φ≠ψ,φ≪ψ if ψ-φ∈ Int C+. For any A⊆C, we write φ≤A if φ≤ψ for all ψ∈A,φ<A if φ<ψ for all ψ∈A,φ≪A if φ≪ψ for all ψ∈A. by α^i⁢(θ)=α,θ∈[-τi,0],i=1, 2. Moreover, for φ∈C, we use xt⁢(φ)⁢(x⁢(t,φ)) to denote the solution of (2.1) with the initial data x0⁢(φ)=φ. Also, xt⁢(φ,F)⁢(x⁢(t,φ,F)) denotes the solution of the following system

	
{x1⁢(t)′=-F⁢(x1⁢(t))+F⁢(x2⁢(t-r¯2)),	r¯2=r¯2⁢(x2⁢(t-δ2))
x2⁢(t)′=-F⁢(x2⁢(t))+F⁢(x1⁢(t-r¯1)),	r¯1=r¯1⁢(x1⁢(t-δ1))
	

with the initial data x0⁢(φ,F)=φ.

{y′⁢(t)=-F⁢(y⁢(t))+d⁢(t),
y⁢(t0)=y0
	

has a unique solution y⁢(t) on [t0,t0+T]. Lemma 2.2. Let φ∈C. Then xt⁢(φ) exists and is unique on 𝐑+1.","2. Preliminary results In this section, some important properties of Eq. (1.2) will be presented. These are of importance in proving our main results in Section 3.

Let C~=C⁢((-∞,0],𝐑1). We say that a function x:𝐑1→𝐑1 is a solution of Eq. (1.2) through φ∈C~ if x is continuous on 𝐑1,x is differentiable on (0,∞), it satisfies Eq. (1.2) for all t≥0, and x|(-∞,0]=φ. Here, x′⁢(0) denotes the right hand derivative of x at 0 . Now, we consider the following differential equation with state-dependent delays

	
x′⁢(t)=-F⁢(x⁢(t))+G⁢(x⁢(t-r¯1),x⁢(t-r¯2),…,x⁢(t-r¯n)),r¯i=r¯i⁢(x⁢(t-δi)),
	

where i=1,2,…,n,r¯i:𝐑1→(0,∞) is a bounded continuous nonnegative function, and

	
τ=max{maxi=1,2,…,nδi,maxi=1,2,…,nsupx∈𝐑1r¯i(x)}}≥mini=1,2,…,n{infx∈𝐑1r¯i(x)}>0.
	

Let C=C([-τ,0],𝐑1 ) be the phase space. We say that a function x:[-τ,∞)→𝐑1 is a solution of Eq. (2.1) through φ∈C if x is continuous on [-τ,∞),x is differentiable on (0,∞), it satisfies Eq. (2.1) for all t≥0, and x|[-τ,0]=φ. Again x′⁢(0) denotes the right hand derivative of x at 0 .

As pointed out in [8], all solutions x⁢(t) of Eq. (1.2) do not tend to constants when t→∞, since Eq. (1.2) may have unbounded solutions. We will show that the bounded solutions x⁢(t) of Eq. (1.2) converge to constants as t→∞. Let x⁢(t) be a bounded solution of Eq. (1.2), then there exist constants A>0 and M>0 such that

	
-A≤x⁢(t)≤A,M=maxi=1,2,…,n⁡{sup-A≤x≤A⁡ri⁢(x)}≥mini=1,2,…,n⁡{inf-A≤x≤A⁡ri⁢(x)}>0.
	

Set

	
ri¯⁢(x)={ri⁢(A),	x≥A,
ri⁢(x),	-A<x<A,
ri⁢(-A),	x≤-A,
	

and

	
τ=max⁡{δ,M}>0.
	

Then, x⁢(t) is a bounded solution of Eq. (2.1) with initial data

	
φ⁢(t)=x⁢(t)|[-τ,0]∈C=C⁢([-τ,0],𝐑1).
	

Therefore, to prove that the bounded solutions x⁢(t) of Eq. (1.2) converge to constants as t→∞, it is sufficient to show the bounded solutions x⁢(t) of Eq. (2.1) converge to constants as t→∞.

In the sequel, 𝐑+1 denotes the set of all nonnegative real numbers. Let C⁢([-τ,0],𝐑1) be equipped with the supremum norm. Then, C=C⁢([-τ,0],𝐑1) is a Banach space. Define C+=C⁢([-τ,0],𝐑+1). It follows that C+is an order cone in the Banach space C and hence C+induces a closed partial ordered relation on C. For any φ,ψ∈C, we write: φ≤ψ if ψ-φ∈C+;φ<ψ if φ≤ψ and φ≠ψ;φ≪ψ if ψ-φ∈Int⁡C+. For any A⊆C, we write: φ≤A if φ≤ψ for all ψ∈A; φ<A if φ<ψ for all ψ∈A;φ≪A if φ≪ψ for all ψ∈A. Similarly, we can define ” ≥ ”, ”¿” and ”»””. For instance, φ≥ψ if φ-ψ∈C+. If σ≥0 and x∈C⁢([-τ,σ],R1), then, for any t∈[0,σ],xt∈C is defined by xt⁢(θ)=x⁢(t+θ), -τ≤θ≤0. For any α∈𝐑1, we define α^∈C by α^⁢(θ)=α,θ∈[-τ,0]. Moreover, for φ∈C, we use xt⁢(φ)⁢(x⁢(t,φ)) to denote the solution of (2.1) with the initial data x0⁢(φ)=φ. Also, xt⁢(φ,F)⁢(x⁢(t,φ,F)) denotes the solution of the equation

	
x′⁢(t)=-F⁢(x⁢(t))+F⁢(x⁢(t-r1¯)),r1¯=r1¯⁢(x⁢(t-δ1))
	

with the initial data x0⁢(φ,F)=φ. Lemma 2.1 ([9]). Let 0<T∈𝐑1 be given and d∈C⁢([t0,t0+T],𝐑1). Then, for any constant x0, the initial value problem

	
{x′⁢(t)=-F⁢(x⁢(t))+d⁢(t),
x⁢(t0)=x0
	

has a unique solution x⁢(t) on [t0,t0+T].

"Proof. Let

	
τ¯=mini=1,2⁡{min⁡{δi,infα∈𝐑1⁡r¯i⁢(α)}}.
	

We will show that xt⁢(φ) exists and is unique on [0,τ]. To see this, let

	
d1⁢(t)=G⁢(x2⁢(t-r2⁢(x2⁢(t-δ2,φ)),φ))=G⁢(φ2⁢(t-r2⁢(φ2⁢(t-δ2))))
	

and

	
d2⁢(t)=G⁢(x1⁢(t-r1⁢(x1⁢(t-δ1,φ)),φ))=G⁢(φ1⁢(t-r1⁢(φ1⁢(t-δ1))))
	

for any t∈[0,τ¯]. Consider the solution xi⁢(t) of the following initial value problem

	
{xi′⁢(t)=-F⁢(xi⁢(t))+di⁢(t),
xi⁢(0)=φi⁢(0)
	

where i∈{1,2}. By Lemma 2.1, xi⁢(t) exists and is unique on [0,τ¯]. Hence, xi⁢(t,φ) exists and is unique on [0,τ¯], that is, xt⁢(φ) exists and is unique on [0,τ¯]. It follows from induction that xt⁢(φ) exists and is unique on [0,+∞). The proof of the lemma is now complete. Let

	
Φ:𝐑+1×C⟶C,Φ⁢(t,φ)=xt⁢(φ)
	

it follows from Lemma 2.2 and Theorem 2.2 in Jack Hall [10] that Φ is a continuous map. Then Φ is a continuous semi-flow on C. To further our discussion, we introduce the following notations for the sake of convenience.

For φ∈C, define O⁢(φ)={xt⁢(φ)∈C:t≥0}. If O⁢(φ) is bounded, then O⁢(φ)¯ is compact in C, where O⁢(φ)¯ denotes the closure of O⁢(φ). If O⁢(φ) is bounded, define

	
ω⁢(φ)=⋂t≥0O⁢(xt⁢(φ))¯,
	

i.e., ω(φ)={ψ∈C : there exists a sequence tk→+∞ such that xtk(φ)→ψ}. It easy to check that ω⁢(φ) is nonempty, compact, invariant and connected. Before continuing, it is convenient to introduce the following assumptions: (A+) G≥F, and for any α∈𝐑1, there exist ε>0 and L>0∈𝐑1 such that F⁢(x)-F⁢(α)≤L⁢(x-α) for all x∈[α,α+ε]. (A-) G≤F, and for any α∈𝐑1, there exist ε>0 and L>0∈𝐑1 such that F⁢(x)-F⁢(α)≥L⁢(x-α) for all x∈[α-ε,α]. Lemma 2.3. Assume ( A+)hold, φ∈C and α∈𝐑1 such that φ≥α^. Then xt⁢(φ)≥α^ for t≥0. Moreover, either xt⁢(φ)≫α^ or xt⁢(φ)=α^ for all t≥4⁢τ,τ=max⁡{τ1,τ2}. Proof. It follows from Proposition 1.1 of Smith [11] that

	
xt⁢(φ)≥xt⁢(α^,F)=α^  for ⁢t≥0.
	

Let y⁢(t)=x1⁢(t,φ),t≥0. Now, we shall consider two cases as follows: Case i y⁢(t)=α for all t∈[0,3⁢τ]. From (2.1), we have

	
F⁢(x1⁢(t,φ))=G⁢(x2⁢(t-r¯2⁢(x2⁢(t-δ2,φ)),φ)), for all ⁢t∈[0,3⁢τ]⁢, 
	

which implies that x2⁢(t-r¯2⁢(x2⁢(t-δ2,φ)),φ)≤y⁢(t)=α, for all t∈[0,3⁢τ]. Thus, x⁢(t,φ)=α^ for all t∈[τ,2⁢τ]. Therefore, xt⁢(φ)=α^ for all t≥τ. Case ii y⁢(t1)>α for some t1∈[0,3⁢τ]. We next will prove that y⁢(t)>α for all t∈[t1,+∞). Otherwise,

	
t2=inf⁡{t≥t1:y⁢(t)=α}<+∞.
	

In view of (A+), there exist constants η∈(0,t2-t1) and L>0 such that

y⁢(t2)≥α+(y⁢(t2-η)-α)⁢e-L⁢η>α,
	

a contradiction to the definition of t2. We claim: there exists t1′∈[0,3⁢τ] such that x2⁢(t1′,φ)>α. Otherwise, by using a similar argument in proof of Case i, we can derive xt⁢(φ)=α^,t≥τ. Thus, x1⁢(t,φ)=α,t≥τ. This contradiction implies the claim is right. It follows that x2⁢(t,φ)>α for all t∈[t1′,+∞). Hence, xt⁢(φ)≫α^ for all t≥4⁢τ. This completes the proof.","roof. Let

By Lemma 2.1, x⁢(t) exists and is unique on [0,δ¯], that is, xt⁢(φ) exists and is unique on [0,δ¯]. Then xt⁢(φ) exists and is unique on 𝐑+1 by induction. This completes the proof. Let

It follows from Lemma 2.2 and Theorem 2.2 in [10] that Φ is a continuous map. Then Φ is a continuous semi-flow on C. To further our discussion, we introduce the following notations for the sake of convenience.

For φ∈C, define O⁢(φ)={xt⁢(φ)∈C:t≥0}. If O⁢(φ) is bounded, then O⁢(φ)¯ is compact in C, where O⁢(φ)¯ denotes the closure of O⁢(φ). If O⁢(φ) is bounded, define

	
ω⁢(φ)=⋂t≥0O⁢(xt⁢(φ))¯,
	

i.e., ω(φ)={ψ∈C : there exists a sequence tk→+∞ such that xtk(φ)→ψ}. It easy to check that ω⁢(φ) is nonempty, compact, invariant and connected. We introduce the following assumptions: (A 𝐀+)(i) G⁢(x1,x2,…,xn)≥F⁢(x1), for all x1,x2,…,xn∈R1, (ii) for any α∈𝐑1, there exist ε>0 and L>0∈𝐑1 such that

	
F⁢(x)-F⁢(α)≤L⁢(x-α)⁢ for all ⁢x∈[α,α+ε]⁢. 
	

(A-) (i) G⁢(x1,x2,…,xn)≤F⁢(x1), for all x1,x2,…,xn∈R1, (ii) and for any α∈𝐑1, there exist ε>0 and L>0∈𝐑1 such that

	
F⁢(x)-F⁢(α)≥L⁢(x-α)⁢ for all ⁢x∈[α-ε,α]⁢. 
	

Lemma 2.3. Assume ( A+)holds, φ∈C, and α∈𝐑1 such that φ≥α^. Then, xt⁢(φ)≥α^ for t≥0. Moreover, either xt⁢(φ)≫α^ or xt⁢(φ)=α^ for all t≥2⁢τ. Proof. It follows from Proposition 1.1 of Smith [11] that

	
xt⁢(φ)≥xt⁢(α^,F)=α^  for ⁢t≥0.
	

Now, we shall consider two cases as follows: Case i. x⁢(t,φ)=α for all t∈[0,2⁢τ]. From (2.1), we have

	
-F⁢(x⁢(t))+G⁢(x⁢(t-r¯1⁢(x⁢(t-δ1,φ)),φ),x⁢(t-r¯2⁢(x⁢(t-δ2,φ)),φ),…,x⁢(t-r¯n⁢(x⁢(t-δn,φ)),φ))≡0,
	

for all t∈[τ,2⁢τ], which implies that

	
-F⁢(α)+G⁢(α,α,…,α)=0.
	

Thus, x⁢(t,φ)=α^ for all t≥2⁢τ. Therefore, xt⁢(φ)=α^ for all t≥2⁢τ. Case ii. x⁢(t,φ)>α for some t1∈[0,2⁢τ]. We next will prove that x⁢(t,φ)>α for all t∈[t1,+∞). Otherwise,

	
t2=inf⁡{t≥t1:x⁢(t,φ)=α}<+∞.
	

In view of (A+), there exist constants η∈(0,t2-t1) and L>0 such that

"Similarly, we can prove the following result. Lemma 2.4. Assume (A-) hold, φ∈C and α∈𝐑1 such that φ≤α^. Then xt⁢(φ)≤α^ for t≥0. Moreover, either xt⁢(φ)≪α^ or xt⁢(φ)=α^ for all t≥4⁢τ. 3. Main results With the preparations in Section 2, we are ready to state and prove our main results. Theorem 3.1. Assume (A+)hold, and φ∈C. If O⁢(φ) is bounded, then there exists α*∈R1 such that ω⁢(φ)={α^*}. Proof. Let α*=sup⁡{α∈R1:α^≤ω⁢(φ)}. Since ω⁢(φ) is compact, we obtain α*∈R1. We will show that ω⁢(φ)={α^*}. Otherwise, ω⁢(φ)\{α^*}≠ϕ. According to the invariance of ω⁢(φ), we have x4⁢τ⁢(ω⁢(φ))=ω⁢(φ). It follows that

	
x4⁢τ⁢(ω⁢(φ))\{α^*}≠ϕ
	

and hence there exists ψ∈ω⁢(φ) such that

	
x4⁢τ⁢(ψ)>α^*.
	

Hence, from Lemma 2.3 and the fact that ψ≥α^*, we obtain

	
x4⁢τ⁢(ψ)≫α^*.
	

Therefore, there exists α**>α* such that

	
x4⁢τ⁢(ψ)≫α^**.
	

Again by the invariance of ω⁢(φ) and its definition, there exists t3>0 such that

	
xt3⁢(φ)≥α^**≫α^*.
	

By Lemma 2.3, we get

	
xt⁢(xt3⁢(φ))≥α^**≫α^*  for ⁢t≥0.
	

Thus,

	
ω⁢(φ)≥α^**≫α^*.
	

This contradicts the definition of α*. The proof of the theorem is now complete. Theorem 3.2. Assume (A_) hold, and φ∈C. If O⁢(φ) is bounded, then there exists α*∈R1 such that ω⁢(φ)={α^*}. Proof. By a similar argument to that in the proof of Theorem 3.1, the conclusion of Theorem 3.2 follows immediately by applying Lemma 2.4. Putting Theorems 3.1 and 3.2 together, we obtain the following result. Proof. From Lemmas 2.3 and 2.4, it follows that O⁢(φ) is bounded. Therefore, by Theorem 3.1 or Theorem 3.2, the conclusion of Corollary 3.1 holds.

Remark 3.1. If (A+)(or (A-)) holds, then by Theorems 3.1 and 3.2, each bounded solution of (1.1) tends to a constant vector as t⟶+∞.","Similarly, we can prove the following result. Lemma 2.4. Assume (A-) holds, φ∈C, and α∈𝐑1 such that φ≤α^. Then, xt⁢(φ)≤α^ for t≥0. Moreover, either xt⁢(φ)≪α^ or xt⁢(φ)=α^ for all t≥2⁢τ. 3. Main results With the preparations in Section 2, we are ready to state and prove our main results. Theorem 3.1. Assume (A+)holds, and φ∈C. If O⁢(φ) is bounded, then there exists α*∈R1 such that ω⁢(φ)={α^*}. Proof. Let α*=sup⁡{α∈R1:α^≤ω⁢(φ)}. Since ω⁢(φ) is compact, we obtain α*∈R1. We will show that ω⁢(φ)={α^*}. Otherwise, ω⁢(φ)\{α^*}≠ϕ. According to the invariance of ω⁢(φ), we have x2⁢τ⁢(ω⁢(φ))=ω⁢(φ). It follows that

	
x2⁢τ⁢(ω⁢(φ))\{α^*}≠ϕ,
	

and hence there exists ψ∈ω⁢(φ) such that

	
x2⁢τ⁢(ψ)>α^*.
	

From Lemma 2.3 and the fact that ψ≥α^*, we obtain

	
x2⁢τ⁢(ψ)≫α^*.
	

Therefore, there exists α**>α* such that

	
x2⁢τ⁢(ψ)≫α^**.
	

Again by the invariance of ω⁢(φ) and its definition, there exists t3>0 such that

	
xt3⁢(φ)≥α^**≫α^*.
	

By Lemma 2.3, we get

	
xt⁢(xt3⁢(φ))≥α^**≫α^*  for ⁢t≥0.
	

Thus,

	
ω⁢(φ)≥α^**≫α^*.
	

This contradicts the definition of α*. The proof of the theorem is now complete. Theorem 3.2. Assume (A_) hold, and φ∈C. If O⁢(φ) is bounded, then there exists α*∈R1 such that ω⁢(φ)={α^*}. Proof. By a similar argument to that in the proof of Theorem 3.1, the conclusion of Theorem 3.2 follows immediately by applying Lemma 2.4. Putting Theorems 3.1 and 3.2 together, we obtain the following result. Corollary 3.1. Let (A+)and (A-)hold and φ∈C. Then there exists α*∈R1 such that ω⁢(φ)={α^*}. Proof. From Lemmas 2.3 and 2.4, it follows that O⁢(φ) is bounded. Therefore, by Theorem 3.1 or Theorem 3.2, the conclusion of Corollary 3.1 holds.

Remark 3.1. If (A+)(or (A-)) holds, then by Theorems 3.1 and 3.2, each bounded solution of (1.1) tends to a constant as t⟶+∞. S",1170.34353.tex,1206.34097.tex,Variation of subject; Errors; Paraphrase

We point out that problems of type (1) were intensively studied in the past decades. We refer to [3,11,12] for some interesting results.

We recall in what follows some definitions and basic properties of the generalized Lebesgue-Sobolev spaces Lp⁢(x)⁢(Ω) and W01,p⁢(x)⁢(Ω), where Ω is a bounded domain in ℝN. Set

Variable exponent Lebesgue spaces resemble classical Lebesgue spaces in many respects: they are Banach spaces [17, Theorem 2.5], the Hölder inequality holds [17, Theorem 2.1], they are reflexive if and only if 1<p-≤p+<∞[17, Corollary 2.7] and continuous functions are dense if p+<∞[17, Theorem 2.11]. The inclusion between Lebesgue spaces also generalizes naturally [17, Theorem 2.8]: if 0<|Ω|<∞ and r1,r2 are variable exponents so that r1⁢(x)≤r2⁢(x) almost everywhere in Ω then there exists the continuous embedding Lr2⁢(x)⁢(Ω)↪Lr1⁢(x)⁢(Ω), whose norm does not exceed |Ω|+1. 2

The space (W01,p⁢(x)(Ω),∥⋅∥p⁢(x)) is a separable and reflexive Banach space.

We refer to [8,9,10,13,17] for further properties of variable exponent Lebesgue-Sobolev spaces.

Remark 1. If p1⁢(x),p2⁢(x)∈C+⁢(Ω¯) it is clear that m⁢(x)∈C+⁢(Ω¯) where m⁢(x)=max⁡{p1⁢(x),p2⁢(x)} for any x∈Ω¯.

Problems of type (1) have been intensively studied in the past decades. We refer to [2],[10],[11],[31],[18],[17],[19] for some interesting results. We point out the presence in problem (1) of the operator Δp1⁢(x)⁢u+Δp2⁢(x)⁢u, where for a real-valued function p⁢(x) we define the p⁢(x)-Laplace operator by Δp⁢(x)⁢u=div⁡(|∇⁡u|p⁢(x)-2⁢∇⁡u). This is a natural extension of the p-Laplace operator, with p a positive constant. However, such generalizations are not trivial since the p⁢(x)-Laplace operator possesses a more complicated structure than the p-Laplace operator, for example it is inhomogeneous.

We recall in what follows some definitions and basic properties of the generalized Lebesgue-Sobolev spaces Lp⁢(x)⁢(Ω) and W01,p⁢(x)⁢(Ω), where Ω is a bounded domain in ℝN. We refer the reader to the book of J. Musielak [20] and the papers of O. Kovacik and J. Rákosník [14], H. G. Leopold [15], D. Edmunds et al. [6], [7], [8] and X. L. Fan et al. [9],[12].

h+=supx∈Ω⁡h⁢(x)  and  h-=infx∈Ω⁡h⁢(x).

Variable exponent Lebesgue spaces resemble classical Lebesgue spaces in many respects: they are Banach spaces [14, Theorem 2.5], the Hölder inequality holds [14, Theorem 2.1], they are reflexive if and only if 1<p-⩽p+<∞ [14, Corollary 2.7] and continuous functions are dense if p+<∞[14, Theorem 2.11].

We denote by Lp′⁢(x)⁢(Ω) the conjugate space of Lp⁢(x)⁢(Ω), where 1/p⁢(x)+1/p′⁢(x)= 1. For any u∈Lp⁢(x)⁢(Ω) and v∈Lp′⁢(x)⁢(Ω) the Hölder type inequality

The space (W01,p⁢(x)(Ω),∥⋅∥p⁢(x)) is a separable and reflexive Banach space. We note that if q∈C+⁢(Ω¯) and q⁢(x)<p⋆⁢(x) for all x∈Ω¯ then the embedding W01,p⁢(x)⁢(Ω)↪ Lq⁢(x)⁢(Ω) is compact and continuous, where p⋆⁢(x)=N⁢p⁢(x)/(N-p⁢(x)) if p⁢(x)<N or p⋆⁢(x)=+∞ if p⁢(x)⩾N [14, Theorems 3.9 and 3.3] (see also [9, Theorems 1.3 and 1.1]).

Remark 1. If p1⁢(x),p2⁢(x)∈C+⁢(Ω¯) then it is clear that m⁢(x)∈C+⁢(Ω¯) where m⁢(x)=max⁡{p1⁢(x),p2⁢(x)} for any x∈Ω¯. On the other hand, since p1⁢(x),p2⁢(x)⩽ m⁢(x) for any x∈Ω¯, it follows by Theorem 2.8 in [14] that W01,m⁢(x)⁢(Ω) is continuously embedded in W01,pi⁢(x)⁢(Ω) for i∈{1,2}. 2.

The same arguments as those used in the case of functional Jλ show that Iλ is well-defined on E and Iλ∈C1⁢(E,ℝ) with the derivative given by

	
⟨Iλ′⁢(u),v⟩=∫Ω(|∇⁡u|p1⁢(x)-2+|∇⁡u|p2⁢(x)-2)⁢∇⁡u⁢∇⁡v⁢d⁢x-λ⁢∫Ω|u|m⁢(x)-2⁢u⁢v⁢𝑑x+∫Ω|u|q⁢(x)-2⁢u⁢v⁢𝑑x,
	

for any u,v∈E. We obtain that the weak solutions of (7) are the critical points of Iλ. This time our idea is to show that Iλ possesses a nontrivial global minimum point in E. With that end in view we start by proving two auxiliary results. Lemma 4. The functional Iλ is coercive on E. Proof. In order to prove Lemma 4 we first show that for any a,b>0 and 0<k<l the following inequality holds

	
a⋅tk-b⋅tl≤a⋅(ab)k/(l-k),∀t≥0.
	

10

Indeed, since the function

	
[0,∞)∋t→tθ
	

is increasing for any θ>0 it follows that

	
a-b⋅tl-k<0,∀t>(ab)1/(l-k)
	

and

	
tk⋅(a-b⋅tl-k)≤a⋅tk<a⋅(ab)k/(l-k),∀t∈[0,(ab)1/(l-k)].
	

The above two inequalities show that (26) holds true. Using (26) we deduce that for any x∈Ω and u∈E we have

	λm-⁢|u⁢(x)|m⁢(x)-1q+⁢|u⁢(x)|q⁢(x)	≤λm-⁢[λ⋅q+m-]m⁢(x)/(q⁢(x)-m⁢(x))	
		≤λm-⁢[(λ⋅q+m-)m+/(q--m+)+(λ⋅q+m-)m-/(q+-m-)]=𝒞,	

where 𝒞 is a positive constant independent of u and x. Integrating the above inequality over Ω we obtain

	
λm-⁢∫Ω|u|m⁢(x)⁢𝑑x-1q+⁢∫Ω|u|q⁢(x)⁢𝑑x≤𝒟
	

where 𝒟 is a positive constant independent of u. Using inequalities (8) and (27) we obtain that for any u∈E with ∥u∥m⁢(x)>1 we have

	Iλ⁢(u)	≥1m+⁢∫Ω|∇⁡u|m⁢(x)⁢𝑑x-λm-⁢∫Ω|u|m⁢(x)⁢𝑑x+1q+⁢∫Ω|u|q⁢(x)⁢𝑑x	
		≥1m+⁢∥u∥m⁢(x)m--(λm-⁢∫Ω|u|m⁢(x)⁢𝑑x-1q+⁢∫Ω|u|q⁢(x)⁢𝑑x)	
		≥1m+⁢∥u∥m⁢(x)m--𝒟	

Thus Iλ is coercive and the proof of Lemma 4 is complete. Lemma 5. The functional Iλ is weakly lower semicontinuous. Proof. In a first instance we prove that the functionals Λi:E→ℝ,

	
Λi⁢(u)=∫Ω1pi⁢(x)⁢|∇⁡u|pi⁢(x)⁢𝑑x,∀i∈{1,2}
	

are convex. Indeed, since the function

	
[0,∞)∋t→tθ
	

is convex for any θ>1, we deduce that for each x∈Ω fixed it holds that

	
|ξ+ψ2|pi⁢(x)≤||ξ|+|ψ|2|pi⁢(x)≤12⁢|ξ|pi⁢(x)+12⁢|ψ|pi⁢(x),∀ξ,ψ∈ℝN,i∈{1,2}.
	

11

Using the above inequality we deduce that

	
|∇⁡u+∇⁡v2|pi⁢(x)≤12⁢|∇⁡u|pi⁢(x)+12⁢|∇⁡v|pi⁢(x),∀u,v∈E,x∈Ω,i∈{1,2}.
	

Multiplying with 1pi⁢(x) and integrating over Ω we obtain

	
Λi⁢(u+v2)≤12⁢Λi⁢(u)+12⁢Λi⁢(v),∀u,v∈E,i∈{1,2}.
	

Thus Λ1 and Λ2 are convex. It follows that Λ1+Λ2 is convex Next, we show that the functional Λ1+Λ2 is weakly lower semicontinuous on E. Taking into account that Λ1+Λ2 is convex, by Corollary III.8 in [2] it is enough to show that Λ1+Λ2 is strongly lower semicontinuous on E. We fix u∈E and ϵ>0. Let v∈E be arbitrary. Since Λ1+Λ2 is convex and inequality (2) holds true we have Λ1⁢(v)+Λ2⁢(v)≥Λ1⁢(u)+Λ2⁢(u)+⟨Λ1′⁢(u)+Λ2′⁢(u),v-u⟩ ≥Λ1(u)+Λ2(u)-∫Ω|∇u|p1⁢(x)-1|∇(v-u)|dx--∫Ω|∇u|p2⁢(x)-1|∇(v-u)|dx ≥Λ1⁢(u)+Λ2⁢(u)-D3⋅∥u-v∥m⁢(x) ≥Λ1⁢(u)+Λ2⁢(u)-ϵ for all v∈E with ∥u-v∥m⁢(x)<ϵ/[||∇⁡u|p1⁢(x)-1|p1⁢(x)p1⁢(x)-1+∥∇⁡u|p2⁢(x)-1|p2⁢(x)p2⁢(x)-1], where D1,D2 and D3 are positive constants. It follows that Λ1+Λ2 is strongly lower semicontinuous and since it is convex we obtain that Λ1+Λ2 is weakly lower semicontinuous.

Finally, we remark that if {un}⊂E is a sequence which converges weakly to u in E then {un} converges strongly to u in Lm⁢(x)⁢(Ω) and Lq⁢(x)⁢(Ω). Thus, Iλ is weakly lower semicontinuous. The proof of Lemma 5 is complete.

Proof OF THEOREM 2. By Lemmas 4 and 5 we deduce that Iλ is coercive and weakly lower semicontinuous on E. Then Theorem 1.2 in [27] implies that there exists uλ∈E a global minimizer of Iλ and thus a weak solution of problem (7).

We show that uλ is not trivial for λ large enough. Indeed, letting t0>1 be a fixed real and Ω1 be an open subset of Ω with |Ω1|>0 we deduce that there exists u0∈C0∞⁢(Ω)⊂E such that u0⁢(x)=t0 for any x∈Ω¯1 and 0≤u0⁢(x)≤t0 in Ω\Ω1. We have

	Iλ⁢(u0)	=∫Ω1p1⁢(x)⁢|∇⁡u0|p1⁢(x)⁢𝑑x+∫Ω1p2⁢(x)⁢|∇⁡u0|p2⁢(x)⁢𝑑x-λ⁢∫Ω1m⁢(x)⁢|u0|m⁢(x)⁢𝑑x+∫Ω1q⁢(x)⁢|u0|q⁢(x)⁢𝑑x	
		≤L-λm+⁢∫Ω1|u0|m⁢(x)⁢𝑑x	
		≤L-λm+⋅t0m-⋅|Ω1|	

12

where L is a positive constant. Thus, there exists λ⋆>0 such that Iλ⁢(u0)<0 for any λ∈[λ⋆,∞). It follows that Iλ⁢(uλ)<0 for any λ≥λ⋆ and thus uλ is a nontrivial weak solution of problem (7) for λ large enough. The proof of Theorem 2 is complete.","4. PROOF OF THEOREM 2 Let E denote the generalized Sobolev space W01,m⁢(x)⁢(Ω) and let λ>0 be arbitrary but fixed.

We start by introducing the energy functional corresponding to problem (7) as Iλ:E→ℝ

	Iλ⁢(u)=	∫Ω1p1⁢(x)⁢|∇⁡u|p1⁢(x)⁢dx+∫Ω1p2⁢(x)⁢|∇⁡u|p2⁢(x)⁢dx	
		-λ⁢∫Ω1m⁢(x)⁢|u|m⁢(x)⁢dx+∫Ω1q⁢(x)⁢|u|q⁢(x)⁢dx.	

The same arguments as those used in the case of the functional Jλ show that Iλ is well-defined on E and Iλ∈C1⁢(E,ℝ) with the derivative given by

	⟨Iλ′⁢(u),v⟩=	∫Ω(|∇⁡u|p1⁢(x)-2+|∇⁡u|p2⁢(x)-2)⁢∇⁡u⁢∇⁡v⁢d⁢x	
		-λ⁢∫Ω|u|m⁢(x)-2⁢u⁢v⁢dx+∫Ω|u|q⁢(x)-2⁢u⁢v⁢dx	

167

for any u,v∈E. We obtain that the weak solutions of (7) are the critical points of Iλ.

This time our idea is to show that Iλ possesses a nontrivial global minimum point in E. With this end in view we start by proving two auxiliary results. Lemma 4. The functional Iλ is coercive on E. Proof. In order to prove Lemma 4 we first show that for any a,b>0 and 0<k<l the following inequality holds: (28) a⋅tk-b⋅tl⩽a⋅(ab)k/(l-k),∀t⩾0. Indeed, since the function

	
[0,∞)∋t→tθ
	

is increasing for any θ>0 it follows that

	
a-b⋅tl-k<0,∀t>(ab)1/(l-k)
	

and

	
tk⋅(a-b⋅tl-k)⩽a⋅tk<a⋅(ab)k/(l-k),∀t∈[0,(ab)1/(l-k)].
	

The above two inequalities show that (28) holds true. Using (28) we deduce that for any x∈Ω and u∈E we have

	λm-⁢|u⁢(x)|m⁢(x)-	1q+⁢|u⁢(x)|q⁢(x)⩽λm-⁢[λ⋅q+m-]m⁢(x)/(q⁢(x)-m⁢(x))	
		⩽λm-⁢[(λ⋅q+m-)m+/(q--m+)+(λ⋅q+m-)m-/(q+-m-)]=𝒞,	

where 𝒞 is a positive constant independent of u and x. Integrating the above inequality over Ω we obtain

	
λm-⁢∫Ω|u|m⁢(x)⁢dx-1q+⁢∫Ω|u|q⁢(x)⁢dx⩽𝒟
	

where 𝒟 is a positive constant independent of u. Using inequalities (10) and (29) we obtain for any u∈E with ∥u∥m⁢(x)>1 that

	Iλ⁢(u)	⩾1m+⁢∫Ω|∇⁡u|m⁢(x)⁢dx-λm-⁢∫Ω|u|m⁢(x)⁢dx+1q+⁢∫Ω|u|q⁢(x)⁢dx	
		⩾1m+⁢∥u∥m⁢(x)m--(λm-⁢∫Ω|u|m⁢(x)⁢dx-1q+⁢∫Ω|u|q⁢(x)⁢dx)	
		⩾1m+⁢∥u∥m⁢(x)m--𝒟	

Thus Iλ is coercive and the proof of Lemma 4 is complete. 168

Lemma 5. The functional Iλ is weakly lower semicontinuous. P ro of. First we prove that the functionals Λi:E→ℝ,

	
Λi⁢(u)=∫Ω1pi⁢(x)⁢|∇⁡u|pi⁢(x)⁢dx,∀i∈{1,2}
	

are convex. Indeed, since the function

	
[0,∞)∋t→tθ
	

is convex for any θ>1, we deduce that for each x∈Ω fixed it the inequality

	
|ξ+ψ2|pi⁢(x)⩽||ξ|+|ψ|2|pi⁢(x)⩽12⁢|ξ|pi⁢(x)+12⁢|ψ|pi⁢(x),∀ξ,ψ∈ℝN,i∈{1,2}
	

holds. Using the above inequality we deduce that

	
|∇⁡u+∇⁡v2|pi⁢(x)⩽12⁢|∇⁡u|pi⁢(x)+12⁢|∇⁡v|pi⁢(x),∀u,v∈E,x∈Ω,i∈{1,2}.
	

Multiplying with 1/pi⁢(x) and integrating over Ω we obtain

	
Λi⁢(u+v2)⩽12⁢Λi⁢(u)+12⁢Λi⁢(v),∀u,v∈E,i∈{1,2}.
	

Thus Λ1 and Λ2 are convex. It follows that Λ1+Λ2 is convex. Next, we show that the functional Λ1+Λ2 is weakly lower semicontinuous on E. Taking into account that Λ1+Λ2 is convex, by Corollary III.8 in [4] it is enough to show that Λ1+Λ2 is strongly lower semicontinuous on E. We fix u∈E and ε>0. Let v∈E be arbitrary. Since Λ1+Λ2 is convex and inequality (2) holds true we have Λ1⁢(v)+Λ2⁢(v)⩾Λ1⁢(u)+Λ2⁢(u)+⟨Λ1′⁢(u)+Λ2′⁢(u),v-u⟩ ⩾Λ1⁢(u)+Λ2⁢(u)-∫Ω|∇⁡u|p1⁢(x)-1⁢|∇⁡(v-u)|⁢dx -∫Ω|∇⁡u|p2⁢(x)-1⁢|∇⁡(v-u)|⁢dx ⩾Λ1⁢(u)+Λ2⁢(u)-D1⋅∥∇⁡u|p1⁢(x)-1|p1⁢(x)p1⁢(x)-1⋅|∇⁡(u-v)|p1⁢(x) ⩾Λ1⁢(u)+Λ2⁢(u)-D3⋅∥u-v∥m⁢(x) ⩾Λ1⁢(u)+Λ2⁢(u)-ε 169

have denoted by D1,D2 and D3 three positive constants. It follows that Λ1+Λ2 is strongly lower semicontinuous and since it is convex we obtain that Λ1+Λ2 is weakly lower semicontinuous.

Finally, we remark that if {un}⊂E is a sequence which converges weakly to u in E then {un} converges strongly to u in Lm⁢(x)⁢(Ω) and Lq⁢(x)⁢(Ω). Thus, Iλ is weakly lower semicontinuous. The proof of Lemma 5 is complete.

Proof of Theorem 2. By Lemmas 4 and 5 we deduce that Iλ is coercive and weakly lower semicontinuous on E. Then Theorem 1.2 in [28] implies that there exists a global minimizer uλ∈E of Iλ and thus a weak solution of problem (7). We show that uλ is not trivial for λ large enough. Indeed, letting t0>1 be a fixed real and Ω1 an open subset of Ω with |Ω1|>0 we deduce that there exists u0∈C0∞⁢(Ω)⊂E such that u0⁢(x)=t0 for any x∈Ω¯1 and 0⩽u0⁢(x)⩽t0 in Ω\Ω1. We have

	Iλ⁢(u0)=	∫Ω1p1⁢(x)⁢|∇⁡u0|p1⁢(x)⁢dx+∫Ω1p2⁢(x)⁢|∇⁡u0|p2⁢(x)⁢dx	
		-λ⁢∫Ω1m⁢(x)⁢|u0|m⁢(x)⁢dx+∫Ω1q⁢(x)⁢|u0|q⁢(x)⁢dx	
	⩽	L-λm+⁢∫Ω1|u0|m⁢(x)⁢dx⩽L-λm+⋅t0m-⋅|Ω1|	

where L is a positive constant. Thus, there exists λ⋆>0 such that Iλ⁢(u0)<0 for any λ∈[λ⋆,∞). It follows that Iλ⁢(uλ)<0 for any λ⩾λ⋆ and thus uλ is a nontrivial weak solution of problem (7) for λ large enough.

Proof. First, we show that {un} is bounded in E. Assume the contrary. Then, passing if necessary to a subsequence, still denoted by {un}, we may assume that ∥un∥m⁢(x)→∞ as n→∞. Thus, we may assume that ∥un∥m⁢(x)>1 for any integer n. By (21) we deduce that there exists N1>0 such that for any n>N1 we have

The last two inequalities show that for each λ>0 there exists a positive constant K3⁢(λ) such that (19) λ⋅∫Ω1m⁢(x)⁢|u|m⁢(x)⁢dx⩽K3⁢(λ)⋅(∥u∥m⁢(x)m-+∥u∥m⁢(x)m+),∀u∈E. By inequalities (15),(18) and (19) we get

	Jλ⁢(u)⩽	K1⋅(∥u∥m⁢(x)p1-+∥u∥m⁢(x)p1+)+K2⋅(∥u∥m⁢(x)p2-+∥u∥m⁢(x)p2+)

for all u∈E. Let u∈E be arbitrary but fixed. We define

	
Ω<={x∈Ω;|u⁢(x)|<1},Ω⩾=Ω\Ω<.
	

Then we have

	Jλ⁢(u)⩽	K1⋅(∥u∥m⁢(x)p1-+∥u∥m⁢(x)p1+)+K2⋅(∥u∥m⁢(x)p2-+∥u∥m⁢(x)p2+)

But there exists a positive constant K4 such that

	
1q+⁢∫Ω<|u|q-⩽K4,∀u∈E.
	

Thus we deduce that

	Jλ⁢(u)⩽	K1⋅(∥u∥m⁢(x)p1-+∥u∥m⁢(x)p1+)+K2⋅(∥u∥m⁢(x)p2-+∥u∥m⁢(x)p2+)

The functional ——:q-E→ℝ defined by

	
|u|q-=(∫Ω|u|q-⁢dx)1/q-
	

is a norm in E. In the finite dimensional subspace E1 the norms |⋅|q-and ∥⋅∥m⁢(x) are equivalent, so there exists a positive constant K=K⁢(E1) such that

	
∥u∥m⁢(x)⩽K⋅|u|q-,∀u∈E1.
	

As a consequence we have that there exists a positive constant K5 such that

	Jλ⁢(u)⩽	K1⋅(∥u∥m⁢(x)p1-+∥u∥m⁢(x)p1+)+K2⋅(∥u∥m⁢(x)p2-+∥u∥m⁢(x)p2+)	
		+K3⁢(λ)⋅(∥u∥m⁢(x)m-+∥u∥m⁢(x)m+)-K5⋅∥u∥m⁢(x)q-+K4,∀u∈E1.	

Hence

	K1⋅(∥u∥m⁢(x)p1-+∥u∥m⁢(x)p1+)	+K2⋅(∥u∥m⁢(x)p2-+∥u∥m⁢(x)p2+)+K3⁢(λ)⋅(∥u∥m⁢(x)m-+∥u∥m⁢(x)m+)

"Abstract This paper is concerned with the regularity of harmonic functions which determines the efficiency of approximation in Sobolev space Wt,p⁢(Ω). The result shows that the nonlinear approximation is always superior to linear approximation for harmonic functions on bounded Lipschitz domain.

Keywords: nonlinear approximation, wavelets, harmonic functions, Sobolev spaces MR(2000) Subject Classification: 42C15, 94A11 1. Introduction This paper is concerned with the Besov regularity of harmonic function (Δ⁢u=0). The particular scale of Besov spaces that we consider is of interest to us because it is connected to the rate of convergence of approximation in Sobolev space. In fact, Dahlke and Devore had studied the similar problem in [1], but their work is restricted to the case of approximation in Lebesgue space. In this paper, we will follow the same line as in [1], but we do in more detailed Sobolev spaces.

We shall restrict our discussion to nonlinear wavelet approximation, then there are two questions: firstly what is the Besov regularity of the function which governs its approximate efficiency in Sobolev spaces; secondly does harmonic functions possess such regularity. Therefore, the first question is solved in section 2 . In section 3 , we will show that the nonlinear approximate efficiency is always superior to that of linear approximation for harmonic functions on bounded Lipschitz domain.

42 Yingchun Jiang and Hong Wang 2. Approximation and Besov spaces Daubechies in [2] has constructed a univariate family Dm of compactly supported wavelets. When m=1,D1 is the Haar function. Larger values of m correspond to higher smoothness of the wavelet Dm and the wavelet Dm has m vanishing moments. We fix an arbitrary value of m and let ϕ=ϕ⁢m be the univariate scaling function which generates the wavelet Ψ=Dm. We define Ψ0=:ϕ and Ψ1=:Ψ. Further, let E denote the nonzero vertices of the square [0,1]d,Ψ denote the set of 2d-1 functions

	
ψe(x1,x2,…xd)=:∏j=1dψej(xj),e∈E
	

and D denote the set of dyadic cubes in Rd. Each cube I∈D is of the form I=2-j⁢k+ 2-j⁢[0,1]d with k⁢2⁢Zd,j∈Z. Then the functions

	
ηI=:ηj,k=2j⁢d2η(2j⋅-k),k∈Zd,j∈Z,η∈Ψ
	

form an orthonormal basis for L2⁢(Rd). If h∈Rd, we denote by Ωh the set of all x∈Ω such that the line [x,x+h] is contained in Ω. The modulus of smoothness ωr⁢(F,t)L⁢p⁢(Ω) of a function F∈Lp⁢(Ω),0 <p≤∞ is defined by

	
ωr(F,t)Lp⁢(Ω)=:sup|h|≤t∥Δhr(F,⋅)∥Lp⁢(Ωr⁢h),t>0
	

with Δhr the r-th difference of step h. For α>0 and 0<q,p⁢∞⁢1, the Besov space Bqα (Lp⁢(Ω)) is defined as the space of all functions F for which

	
|F|Bq⁢(Lp⁢(Ω))=:{(∫0∞[t-α⁢ωr⁢(F,t)Lp⁢(Ω)]q⁢d⁢tt)1q,	0<q<∞
supt>0⁡t-α⁢ωr⁢(F,t)Lp⁢(Ω),	q=∞
	

is finite with r=:[α]+1. Adding ∥F∥L⁢p⁢(Ω), we obtain a quasi-norm for Bqα⁢(Lp⁢(Ω)). It is possible to characterize Besov spaces by wavelet decompositions. We restrict the wavelet expansion to those ηI with |I|≤1 and denote the corresponding dyadic cubes by D+. Let P0 be the orthogonal projector which maps L2⁢(Rd) onto S0, where S0 is expanded by the finite linear combinations of the integer shifts of the function ϕ⁢(x1)⁢… ϕ⁢(xd). If 0<p≤∞, we define ηI,p=:|I|12-1pηI. Let p′ be the conjugate index to p, that is, 1p+1p′=1, we know the following characterization:

Lemma 2.1 ([1]) Let ϕ and Ψ be in Cr (R). If 0<p≤∞ and r>α>d r>α>d⁢(1p-1), then a function F is in the Besov space Bpα⁢(Lp⁢(Rd)) if and only if

	
F=P0⁢(F)+∑I∈D+∑η∈Ψ<F,ηI,p′>ηI,p
	

with ∥P0(F)∥Lτ⁢(Rd)+(∑I∈D+∑η∈Ψ|I|-t⁢τd|<F,ηI,p′>|τ)1τ<∞ providing an equivalent quasinorm for Bpα⁢(Lp⁢(Rd)).

Approximation of Harmonic Functions in Sobolev Spaces 43 Proposition 2.1 Let ϕ,Ψ be in Cr+[t]+1⁢(R) and t≥0. If 1⟨p≤∞,r⟩α⟩0 and 1τ=αd+1p, then a function F is in the Besov space Brα+t⁢(Lr⁢(Rd)) if and only if

	
F=P0⁢(F)+∑I∈D+∑η∈Ψ<F,ηI,p′>ηI,p
	

with ∥P0(F)∥Lτ⁢(Rd)+(∑I∈D++∑η∈Ψ|I|-t⁢rd|<F,ηI,p′>|τ)1τ<∞ providing an equivalent quasinorm for Brα+t⁢(Lr⁢(Rd)). Proof: Using the fact that ηI,τ′=|I|1p′-1τ′⁢ηI,p′, a simple computation gives

	
|I|-α⁢τd|<F,ηI,τ′>|τ=|<F,ηI,p′>|τ
	

Then the desired result follows from Lemma 2.1. In the following, we will use Sobolev spaces. We say f∈Wt,p⁢(Rd) for t≥0, if both f and (-Δ)t2f=:(|ξ|tf(ξ))v belong to Lp⁢(Rd). We let ∥f∥Wt,p(Rd)=:∥f∥L⁢p⁢(R⁢d)+∥(- Δ)t2f∥L⁢p⁢(R⁢d) and |f|W⁢t,p⁢(R⁢d)=:∥(-Δ)f∥L⁢p⁢(R⁢d). We define

	
σn(f)W⁢t,p⁢(Rd)=:inf♯⁢Λ⁢n|f-∑(I,η)∈ΛaI,ηηI|W⁢t,p⁢(Rd)
	

Lemma 2.2([1]) Let ϕ and Ψ be in Cr⁢(R). If 1<p<∞ and r>α>0, then

	
F∈Bτα(Lτ(Rd)),1τ=αd+1p⟺∑n=1∞[nαdσn(F)Lp(Rd)⊤1n<∞
	

Proposition 2.2 Let ϕ,Ψ∈Cr+[t]+1⁢(R) and t≥0. If 1<p<∞ and r>α>0, then

	
F∈Bτα+t⁢(Lτ⁢(Rd)),1τ=αd+1p⟺∑n=1∞[nαd⁢σn⁢(F)Wt,p⁢(Rd)]τ1⁢1n<∞
	

Proof: If f=∑I∈D∑η∈Ψ⟨f,ηI⟩⁢ηI, we let I-tf=:∑I∈D∑η∈Ψ|I|-td⟨f,ηI⟩ηI. Then we first prove

	
F∈Bτα+t⁢(Lτ⁢(Rd))⟺I-t⁢F∈Bτα⁢(Lτ⁢(Rd))
	

In fact, we know from Proposition 2.1 that

	
F∈Bτα+t(Lτ(Rd))⟺∥P0(F)∥Lτ⁢(Rd)+(∑I∈D+∑η∈Ψ|I|-t⁢τd|<F,ηI,p′>|τ)1r<∞.
	

Moreover, it is easy to verify that the right side equals to

	
∥P0(I-tF)∥Lτ⁢(Rd)+(∑I∈D+∑η∈Ψ|<I-tF,ηI,p′>|τ)1τ
	




44 Yingchun Jiang and Hong Wang

	
=∥P0(I-tF)∥Lr⁢(Rd)+(∑I∈D+∑η∈Ψ|I|-α⁢τd|<I-tF,ηI,τ′>|τ)1⊤, 
	

which means by Lemma 2.1 that I-t⁢F∈Bτα⁢(Lτ⁢(Rd)). Furthermore, we can obtain from Lemma 2.2 that

	
∑n=1∞[nαd⁢σn⁢(I-t⁢F)Lp⁢(Rd)]τ⁢1n<∞.
	

Therefore, it is enough to prove on′⁢(I-t⁢F)L⁢p⁢(R⁢d)∼on⁢(F)W⁢t,p⁢(R⁢d) in the following: In fact, for 1<p<∞, we know from [3] that ∥F∥L⁢p⁢(R⁢d)∼∥S⁢(F,⋅)|L⁢p⁢(R⁢d) with

	
S(F,x)=:(∑I∈D∑η∈Ψ|⟨F,ηI⟩|2|I|-1χI(x))12.
	

Moreover, for t≥0, we know from [3] that

	
|F|Wt,p⁢(Rd)∼∥(∑η∈Ψ∑I∈D|⟨F,ηI⟩|2⁢|I|-1⁢|I|-2⁢td⁢χI⁢(x))12∥Lp⁢(Rd).
	

Therefore, we can obtain the desired result from the following argument: σn⁢(F)Wt,p⁢(Rd)=inf♯⁢Λ≤n⁡|F-∑(I,η)∈ΛaI,η⁢ηI|Wt,p⁢(Rd) ∼inft⁢Λ⁢Λ≤n⁡∥(∑η∈Ψ∑I∈D|⟨F,ηI⟩-aI,η⁢δΛ|2⁢|I|-1⁢|I|-2⁢td⁢χI⁢(x))12∥L⁢P⁢(Rd) ∼inf♯⁢Λ⁢n⁡∥(∑η∈Ψ∑I∈D|⟨I-t⁢F,ηI⟩-|I|-td⁢aI,η⁢δΛ|2⁢|I|-1⁢χI⁢(x))12∥Lp⁢(Rd) =inf♯⁢Λ≤n⁡∥I-t⁢F-∑(I,η)∈Λ|I|-td⁢aI,η⁢ηI∥L⁢p⁢(Rd)=σn⁢(I-t⁢F)L⁢p⁢(Rd) Standard finite element methods approximate the functions by elements from linear spaces Sj of piecewise polynomials on uniform grids. Moreover, the approximate efficiency in the norm of Wt,p⁢(Ω),1<p<∞ is given by the following lemma: Lemma 2.3([4]) If nj is the dimension of Sj and t≥0, then

	
dist(u,Sj)W⁢t,p⁢(Ω)=O(nj-αa)⟺u∈B∞α+t(Lp(Ω)).
	

3. Regularity of harmonic functions The following lemma is a simple transformation of Theorem 3.1 in [1]. Lemma 3.1 Let 1≤p≤∞,β>0,t≥0 and k>β be an integer. Then there is a constant C>0 depending only on k,β and such that whenever v is a harmonic function on Ω which is in Bpβ+t⁢(Lp⁢(Ω)), we have

Approximation of Harmonic Functions in Sobolev Spaces 45

	
∥δ⁢(x)k-β⁢|∇k+[t]+1⁡v⁢(x)|∥Lp⁢(Ω)≤C⁢∥v∥Bpβ+t⁢(Lp⁢(Ω))
	

with ∂⁡(x)=: dist (x,∂Ω),Δkv denotes the vector of all k th order derivatives of v and |Δk|v is its Euclidean length. The following is the main result of this paper. Theorem 3.1 Let Ω be a bounded Lipschitz domain in Rd and t≥0. If v is a harmonic function on Ω which is in the Besov space Bp(Lp(Ω))λ+t for some 1<p<∞ and λ>0, then

	
v∈Bτα+t⁢(Lτ⁢(Ω)),1τ=αd+1p,0<α<λ⁢dd-1
	

Proof: We fix τ and α as in the statement of the theorem. Because Ω is a Lipschitz domain, we can extend v to all of Rd with the extension in B⁢pλ+t⁢(Lp⁢(Rd))⁢([5]). We denote this extension also by v.

Let Ψ=:Dm+[t]+1 be the Daubechies’s wavelets with parameter m. We require that m is large enough that the function ϕ and Ψ are in Cs+[t]+1(R),s=:[[d⁢λd-1]]+1. Since Ψ and ϕ have compact support, there is a cube Q⊂Rd, centered at the origin, such that supp η⊂Q for all η∈Ψ. By shifts and dilates, we obtain the cubes Q⁢(I)= : 2-j⁢k+2-j⁢Q,I=2-j⁢k+2-j⁢[0,1]d which contain supp ηI for all η∈Ψ. Let Λ denote the set of pairs (I,η),I∈D+,η∈Ψ, for which Q⁢(I)∩Ω≠∅. Since v∈B⁢pλ+t⁢(Lp⁢(Rd)), we have

	
v=P0⁢v+v0,v0=∑(I,η)∈Λ<v,ηI>ηI=∑(I,η)∈Λ<v,ηI,p′>ηI,p,
	

due to Lemma 2.1. The function P0⁢v is in Lτ⁢(Rd), because it is a finite linear combination of shifts of ϕ⁢(x1)⁢…⁢ϕ⁢(xd). According to Proposition 2.1, it is enough to show

	
(∑(I,η)∈Λ|I|-t⁢τd|<v,ηI,p′>|τ)1τ<∞
	

for completing the proof. For I∈D+, let δI=:I∈D+, let δI=:infx∈Q⁢(I)δ(x). Let Λj denote the set of those pairs (I,η)∈Λ with |I|=2-j⁢d. For each k=0,1,…, let Λj,k⊂Λj be the set of those (I,η)∈Λj such that k⁢2-j≤δI<(k+1)⁢2-j. From the Lipschitz character of Ω, it follows that |Λj,k|≤C⁢2j⁢(d-1) for j,k=0,1,… Since Ω is bounded, we have Λj,k=∅ if k≥C⁢2j. Let Λj0=Λj⁢Λj,0, we now fix j with 0≤j<∞ and estimate the portion of the sum in (3.1) corresponding to (I,η)∈Λj0. For each (I,η)∈Λj0,δI≥ 2-j, so Q⁢(I) is contained strictly in Ω. In addition, according to the Bramble-Hilbert lemma in numerical analysis, there is a polynomial PI of total degree <m+[t]+1 such that

Now, by Lemma 3.1, we obtain

Therefore, summing over the sets Λj,k,k,1,2⁢… gives

Finally, we need to estimate the sum of wavelet coefficients corresponding to the sets Λj,0,⁢j=0,1,… Holder’s inequality and the fact that |Λj,0|≤C⁢2j⁢(d-1) gives

	
∑(I,η)∈Λj,0|I|-t⁢τd|<v,ηI,pp>|τ≤C2j⁢(d-1)⁢(1-τp)(∑(I,η)∈Λj,0|I|-t⁢pd|<v,ηI,pp>|p)τp

From Lemma 2.1, we can know that

the second sum on the right side is finite if the exponent of 2j is negative, that is τ> p⁢(d-1)p⁢λ+d-1, which is the same restriction we had on α in the theorem. We have completed the verification of (3.1) and have therefore proved the theorem.

Remark 3.1 The condition ∑n=1∞[nad⁢σn⁢(F)Wt,p⁢(Rd)]τ⁢1n<∞ is slightly stronger than σn⁢(F)Wt,p⁢(Rd)=O⁢(n-αd). We first introduce weak sequence space to show this fact: we say sequence v={vλ}λ∈∇∈ℓτω⁢(∇) for any τ>0 if supn≥1⁡n1τ⁢vn*<∞, where {v*}nn∈N is the decreasing rearrangement of the absolute value of v. It is easy to see that ℓτ⁢(∇)⊂ℓτω⁢(∇)⊂ℓτ+ε⁢(∇) for any τ>0 and ε>0. Since 1τ=αd+1p, we obtain

	
∑n=1∞[nαd⁢σn⁢(F)Wt,p⁢(Rd)]1⁢1n<∞⟺∑n=1∞[n-1p⁢σn⁢(F)Wt,p⁢(Rd)]⊤<∞
	

which means that {n-1p⁢σn⁢(F)Wt,p⁢(Rd)}n∈N∈ℓ⊤⁢(N), furthermore,

Therefore, proposition 2.2 shows that Bτα+t⁢(Lτ⁢(Rd)),1τ=αd+1p determines the nonlinear wavelet approximate efficiency O⁢(n-ad) in Sobolev space Wt,p⁢(Ω). On the other hand, we know from [5] that increasing the secondary index q in Besov spaces gives a larger space, i.e. Bq1α⁢(Lp⁢(Ω))⊂Bq2α⁢(Lp⁢(Ω)),q1<q2. Therefore, Lemma 2.3 tells us that Bpα+t⁢(Lp⁢(Ω)) determines the same linear approximate efficiency in Sobolev space Wt,p⁢(Ω). Our main result shows that whenever an harmonic function on Lipschitz domain Ω is know to be in a Besov space Bpλ+t⁢(Lp⁢(Ω)), then it automatically has additional smoothness in Besov spaces Bτα+t⁢(Lτ⁢(Rd)). Therefore, nonlinear approximation is always superior to linear approximation.","Abstract: This paper is concerned with the regularity of harmonic functions which determines the efficiency of approximation in Sobolev space Wt,p⁢(Ω). The result shows that the nonlinear approximation is always superior to linear approximation for harmonic functions on bounded Lipschitz domain. AMS Subject Classification: 42C15, 94A11 Key Words: nonlinear approximation, wavelets, harmonic functions, Sobolev spaces 1. Introduction This paper is concerned with the Besov regularity of harmonic function (△u= 0). The particular scale of Besov spaces that we consider is of interest to us because it is connected to the rate of convergence of approximation in Sobolev space. In fact, Dahlke and DeVore had studied the similar problem in [5], but their work is restricted to the case of approximation in Lebesgue space. In this paper, we will follow the same line as in [5], but we do in more detailed Sobolev spaces. Received: September 23, 2008 (c) 2008, Academic Publications Ltd. § Correspondence author

100 Y. Jiang, H. Wang We shall restrict our discussion to nonlinear wavelet approximation, then there are two questions: firstly what is the Besov regularity of the function which governs its approximate efficiency in Sobolev spaces; secondly does harmonic functions possess such regularity. Therefore, the first question is solved in Section 2. In Section 3, we will show that the nonlinear approximate efficiency is always superior to that of linear approximation for harmonic functions on bounded Lipschitz domain. 2. Approximation and Besov Spaces Daubechies in [6] has constructed a univariate family Dm of compactly supported wavelets. When m=1,D1 is the Haar function. Larger values of m correspond to higher smoothness of the wavelet Dm and the wavelet Dm has m vanishing moments. We fix an arbitrary value of m and let ϕ=ϕm be the univariate scaling function which generates the wavelet ψ=Dm. We define ψ0=:ϕ and ψ1=:ψ. Further, let E denote the nonzero vertices of the square [0,1]d,Ψ denote the set of 2d-1 functions

	
ψe(x1,x2,…xd)=:∏j=1dψej(xj),e∈E,
	

and D denote the set of dyadic cubes in Rd. Each cube I∈D is of the form I=2-j⁢k+2-j⁢[0,1]d with k∈Zd,j∈Z. Then the functions

	
ηI=:ηj,k=2j⁢d2η(2j⋅-k),k∈Zd,j∈Z,η∈Ψ,
	

form an orthonormal basis for L2⁢(Rd). If h∈Rd, we denote by Ωh the set of all x∈Ω such that the line [x,x+h] is contained in Ω. The modulus of smoothness ωr⁢(F,t)Lp⁢(Ω) of a function F∈ Lp⁢(Ω),0<p≤∞ is defined by

	
ωr(F,t)Lp⁢(Ω)=:sup|h|≤t∥△hr(F,⋅)∥Lp⁢(Ωr⁢h),t>0
	

with △hr the r-th difference of step h. For α>0 and 0<q,p≤∞, the Besov space Bqα(Lp(Ω) ) is defined as the space of all functions F for which

	
|F|Bqα⁢(Lp⁢(Ω))=:{(∫0∞[t-α⁢ωr⁢(F,t)Lp⁢(Ω)]q⁢d⁢tt)1q,	0<q<∞,
supt>0⁡t-α⁢ωr⁢(F,t)Lp⁢(Ω),	q=∞,
	

is finite with r= : [α]+1. Adding ∥F∥Lp⁢(Ω), we obtain a quasi-norm for Bqα⁢(Lp⁢(Ω)). It is possible to characterize Besov spaces by wavelet decompo-

APPROXIMATION OF HARMONIC FUNCTIONS IN… 101 sitions. We restrict the wavelet expansion to those ηI with |I|≤1 and denote the corresponding dyadic cubes by D+. Let P0 be the orthogonal projector which maps L2⁢(Rd) onto S0, where S0 is expanded by the finite linear combinations of the integer shifts of the function ϕ⁢(x1)⁢…⁢ϕ⁢(xd). If 0<p≤∞, we define ηI,p=:|I|12-1pηI. Let p′ be the conjugate index to p, that is, 1p+1p′=1, we know the following characterization:

Lemma 2.1. (see [5]) Let ϕ and ψ be in Cr⁢(R). If 0<p≤∞ and r>α>d⁢(1p-1), then a function F is in the Besov space Bpα⁢(Lp⁢(Rd)) if and only if

	
F=P0⁢(F)+∑I∈D+∑η∈Ψ<F,ηI,p′>ηI,p
	

with ∥P0(F)∥Lp⁢(Rd)+(∑I∈D+∑η∈Ψ|I|-α⁢pd|<F,ηI,p′>|p)1p<∞ providing an equivalent quasi-norm for Bpα⁢(Lp⁢(Rd)).

Proposition 2.1. Let ϕ,ψ be in Cr+[t]+1⁢(R) and t≥0. If 1<p≤∞, r>α>0 and 1τ=αd+1p, then a function F is in the Besov space Bτα+t⁢(Lτ⁢(Rd)) if and only if

	
F=P0⁢(F)+∑I∈D+∑η∈Ψ<F,ηI,p′>ηI,p
	

with ∥P0(F)∥Lτ⁢(Rd)+(∑I∈D+∑η∈Ψ|I|-t⁢τd|<F,ηI,p′>|τ)1τ<∞ providing an equivalent quasi-norm for Bτα+t⁢(Lτ⁢(Rd)).

Proof. Using the fact that ηI,τ′=|I|1p′-1τ′⁢ηI,p′, a simple computation gives

	
|I|-α⁢τd|<F,ηI,τ′>|τ=|<F,ηI,p′>|τ.
	

Then the desired result follows from Lemma 2.1. In the following, we will use Sobolev spaces. We say f∈Wt,p⁢(Rd) for t≥0, if both f and (-△)t2f=:(|ξ|tf^(ξ))∨ belong to Lp⁢(Rd). We let ∥f∥Wt,p⁢(Rd)= : ∥f∥Lp⁢(Rd)+∥(-△)t2⁢f∥Lp⁢(Rd) and |f|Wt,p⁢(Rd)=:∥(-△)t2f∥Lp⁢(Rd). We define

	
σn(f)Wt,p⁢(Rd)=:inf♯⁢Λ≤n|f-∑(I,η)∈ΛaI,ηηI|Wt,p⁢(Rd).
	

Lemma 2.2. (see [1]) Let ϕ and ψ be in Cr⁢(R). If 1<p<∞ and r>α>0, then

	
F∈Bτα⁢(Lτ⁢(Rd)),1τ=αd+1p⟺∑n=1∞[nαd⁢σn⁢(F)Lp⁢(Rd)]τ⁢1n<∞.
	




102 Y. Jiang, H. Wang Proposition 2.2. Let ϕ,ψ∈Cr+[t]+1⁢(R) and t≥0. If 1<p<∞ and r>α>0, then

	
F∈Bτα+t⁢(Lτ⁢(Rd)),1τ=αd+1p⟺∑n=1∞[nαd⁢σn⁢(F)Wt,p⁢(Rd)]τ⁢1n<∞.
	

Proof. If f=∑I∈D∑η∈Ψ⟨f,ηI⟩⁢ηI, we let I-tf=:∑I∈D∑η∈Ψ|I|-ta⟨f,ηI⟩ηI. Then we first prove

	
F∈Bτα+t⁢(Lτ⁢(Rd))⟺I-t⁢F∈Bτα⁢(Lτ⁢(Rd))
	

In fact, we know from Proposition 2.1 that

	F∈Bτα+t⁢(Lτ⁢(Rd))	
		⟺∥P0(F)∥Lτ⁢(Rd)+(∑I∈D+∑η∈Ψ|I|-t⁢τd|<F,ηI,p′>|τ)1τ<∞.	

Moreover, it is easy to verify that the right hand side equals to

	
∥P0(I-tF)∥Lτ⁢(Rd)+(∑I∈D+∑η∈Ψ|<I-tF,ηI,p′>|τ)1τ
=∥P0(I-tF)∥Lτ⁢(Rd)+(∑I∈D+∑η∈Ψ|I|-α⁢τd|<I-tF,ηI,τ′>|τ)1τ,
	

which means by Lemma 2.1 that I-t⁢F∈Bτα⁢(Lτ⁢(Rd)). Furthermore, we can obtain from Lemma 2.2 that

	
∑n=1∞[nαd⁢σn⁢(I-t⁢F)Lp⁢(Rd)]τ⁢1n<∞.
	

Therefore, it is enough to prove σn⁢(I-t⁢F)Lp⁢(Rd)∼σn⁢(F)Wt,p⁢(Rd) in the following:

In fact, for 1<p<∞, we know from [3] that ∥F∥Lp⁢(Rd)∼∥S⁢(F,⋅)∥Lp⁢(Rd) with

	
S(F,x)=:(∑I∈D∑η∈Ψ|⟨F,ηI⟩|2|I|-1χI(x))12.
	

Moreover, for t≥0, we know from [3] that

	
|F|Wt,p⁢(Rd)∼∥(∑η∈Ψ∑I∈D|⟨F,ηI⟩|2⁢|I|-1⁢|I|-2⁢td⁢χI⁢(x))12∥Lp⁢(Rd).
	

Therefore, we can obtain the desired result from the following argument:

	
σn⁢(F)Wt,p⁢(Rd)=inf♯⁢Λ≤n⁡|F-∑(I,η)∈ΛaI,η⁢ηI|Wt,p⁢(Rd)

Standard finite element methods approximate the functions by elements from linear spaces Sj of piecewise polynomials on uniform grids. Moreover, the approximate efficiency in the norm of Wt,p⁢(Ω),1<p<∞ is given by the following lemma: Lemma 2.3. (see [4]) If nj is the dimension of Sj and t≥0, then dist(u,Sj)Wt,p⁢(Ω)=O(nj-αd)⟺u∈B∞α+t(Lp(Ω)). 3. Regularity of Harmonic Functions The following lemma is a simple transformation of Theorem 3.1 in [1]. Lemma 3.1. Let 1≤p≤∞,β>0,t≥0 and k>β be an integer. Then there is a constant C>0 depending only on k,β and Ω such that whenever v is a harmonic function on Ω which is in Bpβ+t⁢(Lp⁢(Ω)), we have

	
∥δ⁢(x)k-β⁢|∇k+[t]+1⁡v⁢(x)|∥Lp⁢(Ω)≤C⁢∥v∥Bpβ+t⁢(Lp⁢(Ω))
	

with δ(x)=:dist(x,∂Ω),∇kv denotes the vector of all k th order derivatives of v and |∇k⁡v| is its Euclidean length. The following is the main result of this paper. Theorem 3.1. Let Ω be a bounded Lipschitz domain in Rd and t≥0. If v is a harmonic function on Ω which is in the Besov space Bpλ+t⁢(Lp⁢(Ω)) for some 1<p<∞ and λ>0, then

	
v∈Bτα+t⁢(Lτ⁢(Ω)),1τ=αd+1p,0<α<λ⁢dd-1.
	

Proof. We fix τ and α as in the statement of the theorem. Because Ω is a Lipschitz domain, we can extend v to all of Rd with the extension in Bpλ+t⁢(Lp⁢(Rd)) (see [5]). We denote this extension also by v.

Let ψ=:Dm+[t]+1 be the Daubechies’s wavelets with parameter m. We require that m is large enough that the function ϕ and ψ are in Cs+[t]+1⁢(R),s= : [d⁢λd-1]+1. Since ψ and ϕ have compact support, there is a cube Q⊂Rd, centered

104 Y. Jiang, H. Wang at the origin, such that supp η⊂Q for all η∈Ψ. By shifts and dilates, we obtain the cubes Q(I)=:2-jk+2-jQ,I=2-jk+2-j[0,1]d which contain supp ηI for all η∈Ψ. Let Λ denote the set of pairs (I,η),I∈D+,η∈Ψ, for which Q⁢(I)∩Ω≠∅. Since v∈Bpλ+t⁢(Lp⁢(Rd)), we have

	
v=P0⁢v+v0,v0=∑(I,η)∈Λ<v,ηI>ηI=∑(I,η)∈Λ<v,ηI,p′>ηI,p,
	

due to Lemma 2.1. The function P0⁢v is in Lτ⁢(Rd), because it is a finite linear combination of shifts of ϕ⁢(x1)⁢…⁢ϕ⁢(xd). According to Proposition 2.1, it is enough to show

	
(∑(I,η)∈Λ|I|-t⁢τd|<v,ηI,p′>|τ)1τ<∞
	

for completing the proof. For I∈D+, let δI=:infx∈Q⁢(I)δ(x). Let Λj denote the set of those pairs (I,η)∈Λ with |I|=2-j⁢d. For each k=0,1,…, let Λj,k⊂Λj be the set of those (I,η)∈Λj such that k⁢2-j≤δI<(k+1)⁢2-j. From the Lipschitz character of Ω, it follows that |Λj,k|≤C⁢2j⁢(d-1) for j,k=0,1,… Since Ω is bounded, we have Λj,k=∅ if k≥C⁢2j. Let Λj0=Λj\Λj,0, we now fix j with 0≤j<∞ and estimate the portion of the sum in (3.1) corresponding to (I,η)∈Λj0. For each (I,η)∈Λj0,δI≥2-j, so Q⁢(I) is contained strictly in Ω. In addition, according to the Bramble-Hilbert Lemma in numerical analysis, there is a polynomial PI of total degree <m+[t]+1 such that

	
∥v-PI∥Lp⁢(Q⁢(I))≤C⁢|Q⁢(I)|m+[t]+1d⁢|v|Wm+[t]+1⁢(Lp⁢(Q⁢(I)))
≤C⁢|I|m+[t]+1d⁢|v|Wm+[t]+1⁢(Lp⁢(Q⁢(I))).
	

Recall that ηI,p′ is orthogonal to any polynomial of total degree <m+[t]+1, hence

	
|<v,ηI,p′>|=|<v-PI,ηI,p′>|≤∥v-PI∥Lp⁢(Q⁢(I))∥ηI,p′∥Lp′⁢(Rd)

where μI is defined by the last equality and

	
|v|Wm+[t]+1⁢(Lp⁢(Q⁢(I)))=:∑|ν|=m+[t]+1∥Dνv∥Lp(Q(I)

We use Holder’s inequality with exponent pτ and pp-τ to show

		≤C(∫Ω|δ(x)m-λ|∇m+[t]+1v∥pdx)τp≤C∥v∥Bpλ+t⁢(Lp⁢(Ω))τ≤C.	

Therefore, summing over the sets Λj,k,k=1,2⁢… gives

We now choose m large enough that (m-λ)⁢τ>1-τp and obtain

	
∑(I,η)∈Λj0|I|-t⁢τd|<v,ηI,p′>|τ≤C2j⁢((d-1)⁢(p-τ)p-λ⁢τ).
	

We now define Λ0=⋃j=0∞Λj0 and sum over all dyadic levels j=0,1,… to find

provided (d-1)⁢(p-τ)p-λ⁢τ<0, i.e. τ>p⁢(d-1)p⁢λ+d-1. This condition on τ is equivalent to the condition on α given in the theorem.

Finally, we need to estimate the sum of wavelet coefficients corresponding to the sets Λj,0,j=0,1,….Holder’s inequality and the fact that |Λj,0|≤C⁢2j⁢(d-1) gives

From Lemma 2.1, we know that

the second sum on the right hand side is finite if the exponent of 2j is negative, that is τ>p⁢(d-1)p⁢λ+d-1, which is the same restriction we had on α in the theorem. We have completed the verification of (3.1) and have therefore proved the theorem.

It is easy to see that ℓτ⁢(∇)⊂ℓτω⁢(∇)⊂ℓτ+ε⁢(∇) for any τ>0 and ε>0. Since 1τ=αd+1p, we obtain

(1)

Every order bounded weak almost limited operator T:E→F is almost Dunford-Pettis.

(2)

Every positive weak almost limited operator T:E→F is almost Dunford-Pettis.

(3)

One of the following assertions is valid:

(i)

E has the positive Schur property.

(ii)

The norm of F is order continuous.

Proof.

(1)⇒(2) Obvious.

(2)⇒(3) Assume by way of contradiction that E does not have the positive Schur property and the norm of F is not order continuous. We have to construct a positive weak almost limited operator T:E→F which is not almost Dunford-Pettis. As E does not have the positive Schur property, then there exists a disjoint weakly null sequence (xn) in E+ which is not norm null. By choosing a subsequence we may suppose that there is ε with ∥xn∥>ε>0 for all n. From the equality ∥xn∥=sup⁡{f⁢(xn):f∈(E∗)+,∥f∥=1}, there exists a sequence (fn)⊂(E∗)+ such that ∥fn∥=1 and fn⁢(xn)≥ε holds for all n.

Now, consider the operator R:E→ℓ∞ defined by

	
R⁢(x)=(fn⁢(x))n
	

On the other hand, since the norm of F is not order continuous, it follows from Theorem 4.51 of [2] that ℓ∞ is lattice embeddable in F, i.e., there exists a lattice homomorphism S:ℓ∞→F and there exist tow positive constants M and m satisfying

for all (λk)k∈ℓ∞. Put T=S∘R, and note that T is a positive weak almost limited operator (see Remark 2.3). However, for the disjoint weakly null sequence (xn)⊂E+, we have

	
∥T⁢(xn)∥=∥S⁢((fk⁢(xn))k)∥≥m⁢∥(fk⁢(xn))k∥∞≥m⁢fn⁢(xn)≥m⁢ε
	

for every n. This show that T is not almost Dunford-Pettis, and we are done.

(i)⇒(1) In this case, every operator T:E→F is almost Dunford-Pettis.

(i⁢i)⇒(1) Let T:E→F be an order bounded weak almost limited operator and let (xn)⊂E be a positive disjoint weakly null sequence. We shall show that ∥T⁢xn∥→0. By corollary 2.6 of [7], it suffices to proof that |T⁢xn|⁢→𝑤⁢0 and fn⁢(T⁢xn)→0 for every disjoint and norm bounded sequence (fn)⊂(F∗)+.

Indeed

- Let f∈(F∗)+. By Theorem 1.23 of [2], for each n there exists some gn∈[-f,f] with f⁢|T⁢xn|=gn⁢(T⁢xn). Note that the adjoint operator T∗:F∗→E∗ is order bounded [2, Theorem 1.73], and pick some h∈(E∗)+ with T∗⁢[-f,f]⊆[-h,h]. So 0≤f⁢|T⁢xn|=(T∗⁢gn)⁢(xn)≤h⁢(xn) for all n. Since xn⁢→𝑤⁢0, then h⁢(xn)→0 and hence f⁢|T⁢xn|→0. Thus |T⁢xn|⁢→𝑤⁢0.

- Let (fn)⊂(F∗)+ be a disjoint and norm bounded sequence. As the norm of F is order continuous, then by corollary 2.4.3 of [11] fn⁢→w∗⁢0. Now, since T is an order bounded weak almost limited then fn⁢(T⁢xn)→0 (Theorem 2.4). This complete the proof. ∎","Theorem 2.7. Let E and F be two Banach lattices such that F is σ-Dedekind complete.

Proof: (1) ⇒ (2) Assume by way of contradiction that E does not have the positive Schur property and the norm of F is not order continuous. We have to construct a positive almost weak ⋆ Dunford-Pettis operator which is not almost Dunford-Pettis. As E does not have the positive Schur property, then there exists a disjoint weakly null sequence (xn) in E+which is not norm null. By choosing a subsequence we may suppose that there is ϵ>0 with ∥xn∥>ϵ>0 for all n. From the equality ∥xn∥=sup⁡{f⁢(xn):f∈(E′)+,∥f∥=1}, there exists a sequence (fn)⊂(E′)+such that ∥fn∥=1 and fn⁢(xn)≥ϵ holds for all n. Now, consider the operator R:E→ℓ∞ defined by

	
R⁢(x)=(fn⁢(x))n=1∞
	

On the other hand, since the norm of F is not order continuous, it follows from Theorem 4.51 of [1] that ℓ∞ is lattice embeddable in F, i.e., there exists a lattice homomorphism S:ℓ∞→F and there exist tow positive constants M and m satisfying

	
m⁢∥(λk)k∥∞≤∥S⁢((λk)k)∥F≤M⁢∥(λk)k∥∞
	

for all (λk)k∈ℓ∞. Put T=S∘R, and note by Proposition 2.6 that T is a positive almost weak ⋆ Dunford-Pettis operator because ℓ∞ has DP ⋆ property. However, for the disjoint weakly null sequence (xn)⊂E+, we have

	
∥T⁢(xn)∥=∥S⁢((fk⁢(xn))k)∥≥m⁢∥(fk⁢(xn))k∥∞≥m⁢fn⁢(xn)≥m⁢ϵ

"Theorem 2.7.

Let E and F be two Banach lattices such that F has the property (d). Then, the following statements are equivalents:

(1)

Every order bounded weak almost limited operator T:E→F is almost limited.

(2)

Every positive weak almost limited operator T:E→F is almost limited.

(3)

One of the following assertions is valid:

(i)

F has the positive dual Schur property.

(ii)

The norm of E∗ is order continuous.

Proof.

(1)⇒(2) Obvious.

(2)⇒(3) Assume by way of contradiction that F does not have the positive dual Schur property and the norm of E∗ is not order continuous. We have to construct a positive weak almost limited operator T:E→F which is not almost limited. To this end, since the norm of E∗ is not order continuous, there exists a disjoint sequence (fn)⊂(E∗)+ satisfying ∥fn∥=1 and 0≤fn≤f for all n and for some f∈(E∗)+(see Theorem 4.14 of [2]).

On the other hand, since F does not have the positive dual Schur property, then there is a disjoint weak* null sequence (gn)⊂(F∗)+ such that (gn) is not norm null. By choosing a subsequence we may suppose that there is ε with ∥gn∥>ε>0 for all n. From the equality ∥gn∥=sup⁡{gn⁢(y):y∈BF+}, there exists a sequence (yn)⊂BF+ such that gn⁢(yn)≥ε holds for all n.

Now, consider the operators P:E→ℓ1 and S:ℓ1→F defined by

	
P⁢(x)=(fn⁢(x))n
	

and

	
S⁢((λn)n)=∑n=1∞λn⁢yn
	

for each x∈E and each (λn)n∈ℓ1. Since

	
∑n=1N|fn⁢(x)|≤∑n=1Nfn⁢(|x|)=(∨n=1Nfn)⁢(|x|)≤f⁢(|x|)
	

for each x∈E and each N∈ℕ, the operator P is well defined, and clearly P and S are positives. Now, consider the positive operator T=S∘P:E→ℓ1→F, and note that T⁢(x)=∑n=1∞fn⁢(x)⁢yn for each x∈E. Clealry, as ℓ1 has the Schur property, then T is Dunford-Pettis and hence T is weak almost limited. However, for the disjoint weak* null sequence (gn)⊂(F∗)+, we have for every n,

	
T∗⁢(gn)=∑k=1∞gn⁢(yk)⁢fk≥gn⁢(yn)⁢fn≥0⁢.
	

Thus

	
∥T∗⁢(gn)∥≥∥gn⁢(yn)⁢fn∥=gn⁢(yn)≥ε
	

for every n. This show that T is not almost limited, and we are done.

(i)⇒(1) In this case, every operator T:E→F is almost limited. In fact, let (fn)⊂F∗ be a disjoint weak* null sequence. Since F has the property (d) then the positive disjoint sequence (|fn|)⊂F∗ is weak* null. So by the positive dual Schur property of F, ∥fn∥→0, and hence ∥T∗⁢(fn)∥→0, as desired.

(i⁢i)⇒(1) According to Proposition 4.4 of [10] it is sufficient to show fn⁢(T⁢(xn))→0 for every norm bounded disjoint sequence (xn)⊂E+ and every disjoint weak* null sequence (fn)⊂(F∗)+. As the norm of E∗ is order continuous then every norm bounded disjoint sequence (xn)⊂E+ is weakly null [11, Theorem 2.4.14]. Now, since T is an order bounded weak almost limited operator then by Theorem 2.4 fn⁢(T⁢(xn))→0 for every norm bounded disjoint sequence (xn)⊂E+ and every disjoint weak* null sequence (fn)⊂(F∗)+. This complete the proof. ∎","Theorem 2.7. Let E and F be two Banach lattices such that F is σ-Dedekind complete. Then the following assertions are equivalent.

Proof: (1) ⇒ (2) Assume by way of contradiction that E does not have the positive Schur property and the norm of F is not order continuous. We have to construct a positive almost weak ⋆ Dunford-Pettis operator which is not almost Dunford-Pettis. As E does not have the positive Schur property, then there exists a disjoint weakly null sequence (xn) in E+which is not norm null. By choosing a subsequence we may suppose that there is ϵ>0 with ∥xn∥>ϵ>0 for all n. From the equality ∥xn∥=sup⁡{f⁢(xn):f∈(E′)+,∥f∥=1}, there exists a sequence (fn)⊂(E′)+such that ∥fn∥=1 and fn⁢(xn)≥ϵ holds for all n. Now, consider the operator R:E→ℓ∞ defined by

	
R⁢(x)=(fn⁢(x))n=1∞
	

On the other hand, since the norm of F is not order continuous, it follows from Theorem 4.51 of [1] that ℓ∞ is lattice embeddable in F, i.e., there exists a lattice homomorphism S:ℓ∞→F and there exist tow positive constants M and m satisfying

	
m⁢∥(λk)k∥∞≤∥S⁢((λk)k)∥F≤M⁢∥(λk)k∥∞
	

for all (λk)k∈ℓ∞. Put T=S∘R, and note by Proposition 2.6 that T is a positive almost weak ⋆ Dunford-Pettis operator because ℓ∞ has DP ⋆ property. However, for the disjoint weakly null sequence (xn)⊂E+, we have

	
∥T⁢(xn)∥=∥S⁢((fk⁢(xn))k)∥≥m⁢∥(fk⁢(xn))k∥∞≥m⁢fn⁢(xn)≥m⁢ϵ
	

for every n. This shows that T is not almost Dunford-Pettis, and we are done. (a) ⇒ (1) In this case, each operator T:E→F is almost Dunford-Pettis. (b) ⇒ (1) Let (xn)⊂E be a positive disjoint weakly null sequence. We shall show that ∥T⁢(xn)∥→0.

Let f∈(F′)+and by Theorem 1.23 of [1] there exists some g∈[-f,f] with f⁢|T⁢xn|=g⁢(T⁢xn). Since xn→w0 then f⁢|T⁢xn|=g⁢(T⁢xn)=(T′⁢g)⁢(xn)→0, thus |T⁢(xn)|⇉w0. On the other hand, let (fn)⊂(F′)+be a disjoint and norm bounded sequence. As the norm of F is order continuous, then by Corollary 2.4.3 of [5] fn⟶w⋆0.

∥f∥ℳp,λ:=supx,r>0⁡r-λp⁢∥f∥Lp⁢(B⁢(x,r)),
	

where 0≤λ<n,1≤p<∞. We also denote by W⁢Mp,λ the weak Morrey space of all functions f∈W⁢Lploc ⁢(ℝn) for which

	
∥f∥W⁢Mp,λ=supx∈ℝn,r>0⁡r-λp⁢∥f∥W⁢Lp⁢(B⁢(x,r))<∞,
	

where W⁢Lp denotes the weak Lp-space. We find it convenient to define the generalized Morrey spaces in the form as follows.

24 VAGIF S. GULIYEV AND AFAG F. ISMAYILOVA Definition 2.1. Let φ⁢(x,r) be a positive measurable function on ℝn×(0,∞) and 1≤p<∞. We denote by ℳp,φ≡ℳp,φ⁢(ℝn) the generalized Morrey space, the space of all functions f∈Lploc⁢(ℝn) with finite quasinorm

	
∥f∥ℳp,φ=supx∈ℝn,r>0⁡φ⁢(x,r)-1⁢|B⁢(x,r)|-1p⁢∥f∥Lp⁢(B⁢(x,r)).
	

Also by W⁢Mp,φ≡W⁢Mp,φ⁢(ℝn) we denote the weak generalized Morrey space of all functions f∈W⁢Lploc ⁢(ℝn) for which

	
∥f∥W⁢Mp,φ=supx∈ℝn,r>0⁡φ⁢(x,r)-1⁢|B⁢(x,r)|-1p⁢∥f∥W⁢Lp⁢(B⁢(x,r))<∞.
	

According to this definition, we recover the spaces ℳp,λ and W⁢ℳp,λ under the choice φ⁢(x,r)=rλ-np :

	ℳp,λ	=ℳp,φ|φ⁢(x,r)=r⁢λ-np	
	W⁢ℳp,λ	=W⁢ℳp,φ|φ⁢(x,r)=r⁢λ-np	

In [21], the following condition was imposed on φ⁢(x,r) :

	
c-1⁢φ⁢(x,r)≤φ⁢(x,t)≤c⁢φ⁢(x,r)
	

whenever r≤t≤2⁢r, where c(≥1) does not depend on t,r and x∈ℝn, jointly with the condition:

	
∫r∞tα⁢p⁢φ⁢(x,t)p⁢d⁢tt≤C⁢rα⁢p⁢φ⁢(x,r)p,
	

for the fractional maximal operator or fractional integral operator, where C(>0) does not depend on r and x∈ℝn. In [21] the following statements were proved. Theorem 2.1. [21] Let 0<α<n,1≤p<nα,1q=1p-αn and φ⁢(x,r) satisfies the conditions (2.1)-(2.2). Then for p>1 the operators Mα and Iα are bounded from Mp,φ⁢(ℝn) to Mq,φ⁢(ℝn) and for p=1 from M1,φ⁢(ℝn) to W⁢Mq,φ⁢(ℝn).

The following statement, containing results obtained in [19], [21] was proved in [11] (see also [12, 13, 22]). Theorem 2.2. Let 0<α<n,1≤p<nα,1q=1p-αn and (φ1,φ) satisfies the condition

	
∫r∞tα⁢φ1⁢(x,t)⁢d⁢tt≤C⁢φ⁢(x,r),
	

where C does not depend on x and r. Then the operators Mα and Iα are bounded from Mp,φ1 to Mq,φ for p>1 and from Mp,φ1 to W⁢Mq,φ for p=1.

The following statements, containing results Theorems 2.1 and 2.2 was proved in [1], see also [16]. Theorem 2.3. Let 0<α<n,1≤p<nα,1q=1p-αn and (φ1,φ) satisfy the condition

MULTI-SUBLINEAR FRACTIONAL MAXIMAL OPERATOR … 25 where C does not depend on x and r. Let the operator Mα is bounded from Mp,φ1 to Mq,φ for p>1 and from Mp,φ1 to W⁢Mq,φ for p=1.

Theorem 2.4. Let 0<α<n,1≤p<nα,1q=1p-αn and (φ1,φ) satisfy the condition where C does not depend on x and r. Let the operator Iα is bounded from Mp,φ1 to Mq,φ for p>1 and from Mp,φ1 to W⁢Mq,φ for p=1.

Remark 2.1. It is obvious that if condition (2.3) holds, then condition (3.5) holds too. In general, condition (3.5) does not imply condition (2.3). For example, the functions

	
φ1⁢(r)=1χ(1,∞)⁢(r)⁢rnp-β,φ2⁢(r)=r-nq⁢(1+rβ),0<β<np
	

satisfy condition (3.5) but do not satisfy condition (2.3) (see [16]). 3. The multi-sublinear fractional maximal operator in the product spaces ℳp1,φ1⁢(ℝn)×…×ℳpm,φm⁢(ℝn) Let v be a weight. We denote by L∞,v⁢(0,∞) the space of all functions g⁢(t), t>0 with finite norm

	
∥g∥L∞,v⁢(0,∞)=supt>0⁡v⁢(t)⁢|g⁢(t)|
	

and L∞⁢(0,∞)≡L∞,1⁢(0,∞). Let 𝔐⁢(0,∞) be the set of all Lebesgue-measurable functions on (0,∞) and 𝔐+⁢(0,∞) its subset of all nonnegative functions on (0,∞). We denote by 𝔐+⁢(0,∞;↑) the cone of all functions in 𝔐+⁢(0,∞) which are non-decreasing on (0,∞) and

	
𝒜={φ∈𝔐+⁢(0,∞;↑):limt→0+⁡φ⁢(t)=0}.
	

Let u be a continuous and non-negative function on (0,∞). We define the supremal operator S¯u on g∈𝔐⁢(0,∞) by

	
(S¯u⁢g)⁢(t):=∥u⁢g∥L∞⁢(t,∞),t∈(0,∞).
	

The following theorem was proved in [2]. Theorem 3.1. Let v1,v2 be non-negative measurable functions satisfying 0< ∥v1∥L∞⁢(t,∞)<∞ for any t>0 and let u be a continuous non-negative function on (0,∞). Then the operator S¯u is bounded from L∞,v1⁢(0,∞) to L∞,v2⁢(0,∞) on the cone 𝒜 if and only if

	
∥v2⁢S¯u⁢(∥v1∥L∞⁢(⋅,∞)-1)∥L∞⁢(0,∞)<∞.
	

In this section, we will prove the boundedness of multi-sublinear maximal operators on product generalized Morrey space, first we prove the following theorem.

26 VAGIF S. GULIYEV AND AFAG F. ISMAYILOVA Theorem 3.2. Let 1≤p1,…,pm<∞ and 0<α<m⁢n with 1/q=1/p1+ …+1/pm-α/n and α=∑i=1mαi where each αi satisfies 0<αi<npi. Then, for 1<p1,…,pm<∞ the inequality holds for any ball B⁢(x0,r) and for all f→∈Lp1loc ⁢(ℝn)×…×Lpmloc ⁢(ℝn). Moreover, if at least one pi equals one, the inequality

	
∥Mα,m⁢(f→)∥W⁢Lq⁢(B⁢(x0,r))≲rnq⁢∏i=1msupt>2⁢r⁡tαi-npi⁢∥fi∥Lpi⁢(B⁢(x0,t))
	

holds for any ball B⁢(x0,r) and for all f→∈Lp1loc ⁢(ℝn)×…×Lpmloc ⁢(ℝn). Proof. 1<p1,…,pm<∞ and 1/p=1/p1+⋯+1/pm. For arbitrary x0∈ℝn, set B=B⁢(x0,r) for the ball centered at x0 and of radius r,2⁢B=B⁢(x0,2⁢r). We represent f as

	
fj=fj0+fj∞,fj0=fj⁢χ2⁢B,fj∞=fj⁢χC(2⁢B),j=1,…,m.
	

Thus for y∈B⁢(x0,r) we get

	
Mα,m⁢(f→)⁢(y)=supt>0⁡|B⁢(x,t)|αn⁢∏i=1m(1|B⁢(y,t)|⁢∫B⁢(y,t)|fi0⁢(zi)+fi∞⁢(zi)|⁢𝑑zi)

=I1⁢(y)+I2⁢(y)
	

where β1,…,βm∈{0,∞} and each term in the sum ∑′ contains at least one βi=1, and where we denote

	
AB⁢(y,t)⁢fiβi=1|B⁢(y,t)|⁢∫B⁢(y,t)|fiβi⁢(zi)|⁢𝑑zi.
	

By the boundedness of Mα,m:Lp1⁢(ℝn)×…×Lpm⁢(ℝn)→Lq⁢(ℝn) we have

	∥I1∥Lq⁢(B⁢(x0,r))	≤∥Mα,m⁢(f→0)∥Lq⁢(B⁢(x0,r))

		≤C⁢rnq⁢∏i=1msupt>2⁢r⁡tαi-npi⁢∥fi∥Lpi⁢(B⁢(x0,t)).	

To treat the term I2⁢(y), we first consider the case β1=β2=…=βm=∞. Let y be an arbitrary point from B. If B(y,t)∩(2B)c≠∅, then t>r. Indeed, if zi∈B(y,t)∩(2B)C, then t>|y-zi|≥|x-zi|-|x-y|>2⁢r-r=r for i=1,…,m.

MULTI-SUBLINEAR FRACTIONAL MAXIMAL OPERATOR … 27 On the other hand, B(y,t)∩(2B)C⊂B(x0,2t). Indeed, zi∈B(y,t)∩(2B)C, then we get |x0-zi|≤|y-zi|+|x0-yi|<t+r<2⁢t for i=1,…,m.

		≲supt>2⁢r⁡∏i=1mtαi-npi⁢∥fi∥Lpi⁢(B⁢(x0,t)).	

Therefore, for all y∈B we have

For the case that βj⁢1=⋯=βj⁢l=0 for some {j⁢1,…,j⁢l}⊂{1,…,m} where 1≤l<m, we only consider the case β1=∞ since the other ones follow in analogous way. Note that

Then combine the estimates above we can easily get that

28 VAGIF S. GULIYEV AND AFAG F. ISMAYILOVA Hence we have obtained

		≲rnq⁢∏i=1msupt>2⁢r⁡tαi-npi⁢∥fi∥Lpi⁢(B⁢(x0,t)).	

Thus we obtain (3.2). For the case that at least one pi equals one, repeat the estimates above and note that f→→Mα,m⁢(f→) is boundedness from Lp1⁢(ℝn)×⋯×Lpm⁢(ℝn) to Lp,∞⁢(ℝn), the proof of (3.3) can be treated similarly and we omit the details here.

Next we give the boundedness of multilinear fractional maximal operator f→→ Mα,m⁢(f→) on product generalized Morrey space.

Theorem 3.3. Let 1≤p1,…,pm<∞ and 0<α<m⁢n with 1/q=1/p1+…+ 1/pm-α/n and α=∑i=1mαi where each αi satisfies 0<αi<npi. Suppose that (φ1,φ2) satisfies the condition

where C does not depend on x and r. Then, if all pi>1, it follows

	
∥Mα,m⁢(f→)∥ℳq,ψ≤C⁢∥f1∥ℳp1,φ1⁢⋯⁢∥fm∥ℳpm,φm,
	

and if at least one pi=1, it follows

	
∥Mα,m⁢(f→)∥W⁢Mq,ψ≤C⁢∥f1∥ℳp1,φ1⁢…⁢∥fm∥ℳpm,φm,
	

with the constant C independent of f→. Proof. Let 1≤p1,…,pm<∞ with 1/p=1/p1+…+1/pm and f→∈ℳp1,φ1× …×ℳpm,φ1. By Theorems 3.1 and 3.2 we obtain

by (3.5), which completes the proof for 1<p1,…,pm<∞ and 0<α<m⁢n with 1/q=1/p1+…+1/pm-α/n.

For pi=1 and fi∈ℳ1,φ1⁢(i=1,…,m), by the definition of ℳ1,φ and a similar argument as before we can get

	
∥Mα,m⁢(f→)∥W⁢ℳq,ψ≤C⁢∥f1∥ℳp1,φ1⁢…⁢∥fm∥ℳpm,φm.

Theorem 3.3 do not impose the pointwise doubling condition (2.1) and (2.2). In the case φ1⁢(x,r)=φ2⁢(x,r)=φ⁢(x,r) Theorem 3.3 containing the results Theorem 2.1. 4. The multilinear fractional integral operators in the product spaces ℳp1,φ1⁢(ℝn)×…×ℳpm,φm⁢(ℝn)

(H⁢g)⁢(t):=1t⁢∫0tg⁢(r)⁢𝑑r,0<t<∞.
	

Theorem 4.1. ([3]) The inequality

Theorem 4.2. Let 1≤p1,…,pm<∞ and 0<α<m⁢n with 1/q=1/p1+ …+1/pm-α/n and α=∑i=1mαi where each αi satisfies 0<αi<npi. Then, for 1<p1,…,pm<∞ the inequality

holds for any ball B⁢(x0,r) and for all f→∈Lp1l⁢o⁢c⁢(ℝn)×…×Lpml⁢o⁢c⁢(ℝn).","n this work, we prove the boundedness of the multi-sublinear maximal operator Mm and multilinear singular integral operators Tm from product generalized Morrey space Mp1,φ1×…×Mpm,φm to Mp,φ, if 1<p1,…,pm<∞ and 1/p=1/p1+⋯+1/pm, and from the space Mp1,φ1×…×Mpm,φm to the weak space W⁢M1,φ, if 1≤p1,…,pm<∞,1/p=1/p1+⋯+1/pm and at least one exponent pi equals one.

By A≲B we mean that A≤C⁢B with some positive constant C independent of appropriate quantities. If A≲B and B≲A, we write A≈B and say that A and B are equivalent. 2. Generalized Morrey spaces In the study of local properties of solutions to of partial differential equations, together with weighted Lebesgue spaces, Morrey spaces Mp,λ⁢(ℝn) play an important role, see [5], [17].

∥f∥W⁢Mp,λ=supx∈ℝn,r>0⁡r-λp⁢∥f∥W⁢Lp⁢(B⁢(x,r))<∞,
	

where W⁢Lp denotes the weak Lp-space. We find it convenient to define the generalized Morrey spaces in the form as follows.

Definition 2.1. Let φ⁢(x,r) be a positive measurable function on ℝn×(0,∞) and 1≤p<∞. We denote by Mp,φ≡Mp,φ⁢(ℝn) the generalized Morrey space, the space of all functions f∈Lploc ⁢(ℝn) with finite quasinorm

	
∥f∥Mp,φ=supx∈ℝn,r>0⁡φ⁢(x,r)-1⁢|B⁢(x,r)|-1p⁢∥f∥Lp⁢(B⁢(x,r)).

According to this definition, we recover the spaces Mp,λ and W⁢Mp,λ under the choice φ⁢(x,r)=rλ-np :

	Mp,λ	=Mp,φ|φ⁢(x,r)=r⁢λ-np,	
	W⁢Mp,λ	=W⁢Mp,φ|φ⁢(x,r)=r⁢λ-np.	

In [20], the following condition was imposed on φ⁢(x,r) :

	
c-1⁢φ⁢(x,r)≤φ⁢(x,t)≤c⁢φ⁢(x,r)
	

whenever r≤t≤2⁢r, where c(≥1) does not depend on t,r and x∈ℝn, jointly with the condition:

The following statements, containing results Theorems 2.1 and 2.2 was proved in [1], see also [16]. Theorem 2.3. Let 1≤p<∞ and (φ1,φ) satisfy the condition where C does not depend on x and r. Let the operator M is bounded from Mp,φ1 to Mp,φ for p>1 and from M1,φ1 to W⁢M1,φ. Theorem 2.4. Let 1≤p<∞ and (φ1,φ) satisfy the condition where C does not depend on x and r. Let the operator T is bounded from Mp,φ1 to Mp,φ for p>1 and from M1,φ1 to W⁢M1,φ.

Remark 2.1. It is obvious that if condition (2.3) holds, then condition (3.5) holds too. In general, condition (3.5) does not imply condition (2.3). For example, the functions

	
φ1⁢(r)=1χ(1,∞)⁢(r)⁢rnp-β,φ2⁢(r)=r-np⁢(1+rβ),0<β<np
	

satisfy condition (3.5) but do not satisfy condition (2.3) (see [16]). 3. The multi-sublinear maximal operator in the product spaces

fj=fj0+fj∞,fj0=fj⁢χ2⁢B,fj∞=fj⁢χc(2⁢B),j=1,…,m.
	

Thus for y∈B⁢(x0,r) we get

To treat the term I2⁢(y), we first consider the case β1=β2=…=βm=∞. Let y be an arbitrary point from B. If B(y,t)∩∩c(2B)≠∅, then t>r. Indeed, if zi∈B(y,t)∩(2B)C, then t>|y-zi|≥|x-zi|-|x-y|>2⁢r-r=r for i=1,…,m.

On the other hand, B(y,t)∩(2B)c⊂B(x0,2t). Indeed, zi∈B⁢(y,t)∩c(2⁢B), then we get |x0-zi|≤|y-zi|+|x0-yi|<t+r<2⁢t for i=1,…,m.

For the case that βj⁢1=⋯=βj⁢l=0 for some {j⁢1,…,j⁢l}⊂{1,…,m} where 1≤l<m, we only consider the case β1=∞ since the other ones follow in analogous way. Note that

"THEOREM 4.1. Let L be a large subgroup of a p-group G determined by the sequence (n0,n1,⋯). Suppose ϕ is a monomorphism of L into a p-group K. Then ϕ can be extended to an isomorphism of G onto K if and only if the following conditions are satisfied: (i) fG⁢(n)=fK (n) for n≤n0, (ii) hG⁢(x)=hK⁢(ϕ⁢(x)) for all x∈L, (iii) ϕ⁢(L) is a large subgroup of K. Proof. The three conditions are clearly necessary; let us therefore assume that they are satisfied. The group G contains a basic subgroup B=∑n=1∞Bn, where for each n either Bn=0 or Bn≅Σ⁢C⁢(pn). There exists a nondecreasing sequence k1,k2,⋯ of nonnegative integers, with kn≤n-1 for n>n0 and such that

	
B∩L=∑n=n0+1∞pkn⁢Bn⁢. 
	




LARGE SUBGROUPS AND SMALL HOMOMORPHISMS 159 Because of (i), we may assume that Bn=0 for n≤n0⋅ Now suppose Bn=Σ⁢{bλ(n)},

	
𝐩𝐤n⁢𝐁𝐧=Σ⁢{xλ(n)}  and  ϕ⁢(pkn⁢Bn)=Σ⁢{yλ(n)}
	

where yλ(n)=ϕ⁢(xλ(n)) and hK⁢(yλ(n))=kn. Choose cλ(n)∈K such that pkn⁢cλ(n)=yλ(n), and set Cn=Σ⁢{cλ(n)}. Setting C=∑n=n0+1∞Cn, we see that there is an isomorphism ψ of B onto C such that

	
ψ⁢(bλ(n))=cλ(n)⁢ and ⁢ψ|B∩L=ϕ|B∩L⁢. 
	

Clearly, C is pure in K. Since ϕ⁢(L) is fully invariant in K,ϕ⁢(L)∩Cn=pm⁢Cn for some m≤kn. It can easily be shown that the assumption m<kn violates (ii). Thus,

	
ϕ⁢(L)∩C=∑n=n0+𝐥∞ϕ⁢(L)∩Cn=∑n=n0+1∞pkn⁢Cn=ϕ⁢(B∩L)
	

It can also be shown that C is a basic subgroup of K. For if C is not a basic subgroup of K, then there exists an integer n and a y ϵ⁢K having order pn such that Cn+{y} is a direct summand of K. However, the existence of such a y can also be shown to contradict (ii). We then define a mapping ϕ¯ of G={L,B} onto K={ϕ⁢(L),C} as follows:

	
ϕ¯⁢(l+b)=ϕ⁢(l)+ψ⁢(b) (l∈L,b∈B).
	

It is then easy to verify that ϕ¯ is a well-defined homomorphism, and that it is oneto-one. ϕ¯ is then an isomorphism of G onto K such that ϕ¯∣L=ϕ. COROLLARY 4.2. Each automorphism of a large subgroup that preserves heights (as computed in the containing group) is induced by an automorphism of the containing p-group. In particular, every automorphism of pn⁢G, where n is an integer, is induced by an automorphism of G.

COROLLARY 4.3. If H and K are dense, pure subgroups of a p-group G such that H∩L=K∩L for some large subgroup L of G, then H≅K.

F","Theorem 2.5. Let L be a large submodule of a Q⁢T⁢A⁢G-module M determined by the sequence n⁢(L)=(n0,n1,…). Then a monomorphism α of L into a Q⁢T⁢A⁢G-module N can be extended to an isomorphism of M onto N if and only if (i) fM⁢(n)=fN⁢(n) for n⩽n0 (ii) HM⁢(x)=HN⁢(α⁢(x)), for every x∈L and (iii) α⁢(L) is large in N. Proof. Suppose these conditions hold and B=⨁i=1∞Bi is a basic submodule of M. Now for every n>n0, there exists a monotonically increasing sequence of nonnegative integers k1,k2,… with kn⩽n-1 and B∩L=∑n=n0+1∞Hkn⁢(Bn). Since fM⁢(n)=fN⁢(n) for n⩽n0, we may assume Bn=0. Otherwise if Bn=∑xin⁢R and d⁢(xin⁢Ryin⁢R)=kn, then Hkn⁢(Bn)=∑yin⁢R and α⁢(Hkn⁢(Bn))=∑zin⁢R, where zin=α⁢(yin) and HN⁢(zin)=kn. Now we may select uin∈N such that d⁢(zin⁢Ruin⁢R)=kn. If we put Qn=∑uin⁢R,Q=∑n=n0+1∞Qn, then there is an isomorphism β:B⟶Q such that β⁢(xin)=uin and β|B∩L=α|B∩L. Now Q is h-pure in N and α⁢(L) is fully invariant in N,α⁢(L)∩Qn=Hj⁢(Qn) for some j⩽kn, which is a contradiction because HM⁢(x)=HN⁢(α⁢(x)), for every x∈L. Therefore α⁢(L)∩Q=∑n=n0+1∞α⁢(L)∩Q= ∑n=n0+1∞Hkn⁢(Qn)=α⁢(B∩L)

24 ALVEERA MEHDI, SABAH A R K NAJI AND AYAZUL HASAN Again Q is a basic submodule of N, otherwise we may find an integer m and an element u∈Hm⁢(N) such that Qm+y⁢R is a summand of N, contradicting the fact that α⁢(L) is large in N.

As M=L+B we may consider a map α¯:M⟶N such that α¯⁢(x)=α¯⁢(l+b)= α⁢(l)+β⁢(b). This α¯ is well defined monomorphism because N=α⁢(L)+Q. Now α¯ is an isomorphism of M onto N such that α¯|L=α. We conclude with the following remarks: Remark 2.2. Each automorphism of a large submodule which preserves heights is induced by an automorphism of the containing Q⁢T⁢A⁢G-module. Therefore every automorphism of Hk⁢(M),k=0,1,2,…⁢∞ is induced by an automorphism of M.

"THEOREM 3.4. Let B be a basic subgroup of the closed p-g⁢r⁢o⁢u⁢p⁢B¯. If B¯∼G, then either B∼G/G1, or G/G1 contains an unbounded closed p-group as a subgroup.

Proof. If B¯∼G, then there exists a homomorphism ϕ of B¯ onto G/G1. If G/G1 does not contain an unbounded closed p-group as a subgroup, then ϕ is necessarily small. In this case, B¯ contains a large subgroup L such that G/G1 is a homomorphic image of B¯/L={B,L}/L≅B/B∩L and thus a homomorphic image of B itself. THEOREM 3.5. Let G be a dense pure subgroup of a closed p-group B¯. If either G=B¯ or |B¯/G|=ℵ0, then G is thick. Proof Gi-If =B¯, then the conclusion is an immediate corollary of Theorem 3.1. Suppose |B¯/G|=ℵ0, and let ϕ be a homomorphism of G into a direct sum of cyclic groups. Then A=im⁡ϕ is a direct sum of cyclic groups, and A is the basic subgroup of a closed p-group A¯. ϕ then extends uniquely to a homomorphism ϕ¯ of B¯ into A¯. If H=im⁡ϕ, then |H/A|≤ℵ0. Since A is a direct sum of cyclic groups and Hl=0,H is itself necessarily a direct sum of cyclic groups. Thus, ϕ¯ is small, and consequently ϕ=ϕ¯∣G is also small.","Theorem 2.3. Let M(=B¯) be a closed Q⁢T⁢A⁢G-module with a basic submodule B. For the homomorphic image N of B¯, either N/N1 is the homomorphic image of B or N/N1 contains an unbounded closed submodule.

Proof. The homomorphism from M onto N, with the natural homomorphism N→ N/N1, gives rise to a homomorphism α:M⟶N/N1. If N/N1 does not contain an unbounded closed submodule, then α is small. This implies that M contains a large submodule L such that N/N1 is homomorphic image of M/L.

Proof. If N=M, then the result follows from Theorem 2.2. Suppose g⁢(M/N)=ℵ0 and α is a homomorphism of N into a direct sum of uniserial modules. Then α⁢(N)=K is also a direct sum of uniserial modules. If we consider K¯, then K is a basic submodule of K¯. Since N¯=B¯, the homomorphism α may be uniquely extended to α¯:M⟶K¯ and g⁢(α¯⁢(M)K)⩽ℵ0. Again K1 is {0}, therefore α¯⁢(M) is also a direct sum of uniserial modules.

Then Hom⁢(G,K) properly contains Homs⁢(G,K) if and only if K contains an unbounded closed p-group as a subgroup. Proof. If K does contain an unbounded closed p-group as a subgroup, then it is easy to exhibit a nonsmall homomorphism of G into K.

Suppose conversely that there exists a nonsmall homomorphism ϕ of G into K. Then ker ϕ contains no large subgroup of G, and by Corollary 2.10 in [9] we can find a positive integer k0 and a sequence x1,x2,⋯ of elements in G such that for each i,

and H′/C′ is divisible. In order to see that C′ is a basic subgroup of H′, it remains only to show that C′ is pure in H′. However, this will follow readily from the observation that H∩ker⁡ϕ is precisely the closure in G of 𝐂∩ker⁡ϕ. Then, to complete the proof that H′ is a closed p-group, it suffices to show that every Cauchy sequence (relative to the p-adic topology on H′ ) in C′⁢[p]=∑i=1∞{yi} has a limit in H′. It is evident that every Cauchy sequence z1′,z2′,⋯ in C′⁢[p] is the term-byterm image under ϕ of a Cauchy sequence z1,z2,⋯ in H with each zn contained in the bounded subgroup ∑i=1∞{xi}. Consequently the sequence z1,z2,⋯ has a limit z in H, and z′=ϕ⁢(z) is the limit in H′ of the sequence z1′,z2′,⋯.

"1. Introduction In this work we study a generalization of the structurally phenomenological Pokrovski-Vinogradov model describing flows of melts and solutions of incompressible viscoelastic polymeric media to the non-isothermal case under the influence of magnetic field. In the Pokrovski-Vinogradov model, the polymeric medium is considered as a suspension of polymer macromolecules that move in an anisotropic fluid produced, for example, by a solvent and other macromolecules. The influence of environment on a real macromolecule is modeled by the action on a linear chain of brownian particles, each of which represents a large enough part of the macromolecule. Brownian particles often called ”beads” are connected to each other by 2

The physical representation of linear polymer flows described above results in the formulation of the Pokrovski-Vinogradov rheological model [1]-[3]:

where σi⁢k is the stress tensor, p is the hydrostatic pressure, η0,τ0 are the initial values of the shear viscosity and the relaxation time for the viscoelastic component, vi⁢j is the tensor of the velocity gradient, ai⁢k is the symmetrical tensor of additional stresses of second rank, I=a11+a22+a33 is the first invariant of the tensor of additional stresses, γi⁢k=vi⁢k+vk⁢i2 is the symmetrized tensor of the velocity gradient, k and β are the phenomenological parameters taking into account the shape and the size of the coiled molecule in the dynamics equations of the polymer macromolecule, ρ is the polymer density, vi is the i-th velocity component.

Structurally, the model consists of the incompressibility and motion equations (1.1) as well as the rheological relations (1.2), (1.3) connecting kinematic characteristics of the flow and its inner thermodynamic parameters.

Some generalizations of model (1.1) - (1.3) provide good results in numerical simulations for viscosymetric flows [4]. For example, such a generalization is a model for which in equation (1.2) we add a term taking into account the so-called shear viscosity, and the parameter β is additionally dependent on the first invariant of the anisotropy tensor. Therefore, we may believe that modifications of the basic Polrovski-Vinogradov model could be useful for modeling the polymer motion in complex deformation conditions, e.g., for stationary and non-stationary flows in circular channels, flows in channels with a fast change of sectional area and flows with a free boundary. An important feature of such flows is their two- and three dimensional character.

In this work, we consider one of such generalizations that takes into account the influence of the heat and the magnetic field on the polymeric fluid motion (see Sect. 1 for more details). Our main interest is the analogue of the well-known shear flow in an infinite channel that is the Poiseuille flow. It turns out that in our case this flow has a number of features.

". Introduction and Preliminaries Katsaras [14] defined a fuzzy norm on a vector space to construct a fuzzy vector topological structure on the space. Some mathematicians have defined fuzzy norms on a vector space from various points of view [11,16,37].

(N6) for x≠0,N⁢(x,⋅) is continuous on ℝ. The pair (X,N) is called a fuzzy normed vector space. The properties of fuzzy normed vector spaces and examples of fuzzy norms are given in [19,20].

Definition 1.2 ([3, 19,20, 21] ). Let (X,N) be a fuzzy normed vector space. A sequence {xn} in X is said to be convergent or converge if there exists an x∈X such that limn→∞⁡N⁢(xn-x,t)=1 for all t>0. In this case, x is called the limit of the sequence {xn} and we denote it by N - limn→∞⁡xn=x.

Definition 1.3 ([3, 19, 20, 21]). Let (X,N) be a fuzzy normed vector space. A sequence {xn} in X is called Cauchy if for each ε>0 and each t>0 there exists an n0∈ℕ such that for all n≥n0 and all p>0, we have N⁢(xn+p-xn,t)>1-ε. It is well-known that every convergent sequence in a fuzzy normed vector space is Cauchy. If each Cauchy sequence is convergent, then the fuzzy norm is said to be complete and the fuzzy normed vector space is called a fuzzy Banach space.

We say that a mapping f:X→Y between fuzzy normed vector spaces X and Y is continuous at a point x0∈X if for each sequence {xn} converging to x0 in X, then the sequence {f⁢(xn)} converges to f⁢(x0). If f:X→Y is continuous at each x∈X, then f:X→Y is said to be continuous on X (see [4]).

The stability problem of functional equations originated from a question of Ulam [36] concerning the stability of group homomorphisms.

The functional equation f⁢(x+y)=f⁢(x)+f⁢(y) is called the Cauchy equation. In particular, every solution of the Cauchy equation is said to be an additive mapping. Hyers [13] gave a first affirmative partial answer to the question of Ulam for Banach spaces. Hyers’ Theorem was generalized by Aoki [2] for additive mappings and by Rassias [28] for linear mappings by considering an unbounded Cauchy difference. A generalization of the Rassias theorem was obtained by Găvruta [12] by replacing the unbounded Cauchy difference by a general control function in the spirit of Rassias’ approach.

"Abstract. We establish a Liouville-type theorem for a subcritical nonlinear problem, involving a fractional power of the subLaplacian in the Heisenberg group. To prove our result we will use the local realization of fractional CR covariant operators, which can be constructed as the Dirichlet-to-Neumann operator of a degenerate elliptic equation in the spirit of Caffarelli and Silvestre 9. as established in [16. The main tools in our proof are the CR inversion and the moving plane method, applied to the solution of the lifted problem in the half-space ℍn×ℝ+. 1. Introduction and Main Results In this paper we establish a Liouville-type result for the following fractional nonlinear problem in the Heisenberg group:

	
𝒫12⁢u=up⁢ in ⁢ℍn.
	

Here 𝒫12 denotes a CR covariant operator of order 1/2 in ℍn, whose principal symbols agree with the pure fractional power 1/2 of the Heisenberg Laplacian -Δℍ. In [16 Frank, Gonzalez, Monticelli and one of the authors, study CR covariant operators of fractional orders on orientable and strictly pseudoconvex CR manifolds. In particular, they focuse on the construction of such operators as the Dirichlet-toNeumann map associated to a degenarate elliptic equation in the spirit of Caffarelli and Silvestre [9].

In this context, the Heisenberg group ℍn plays the same role as ℝn in conformal geometry, in the sense that, as shown by Folland and Stein in [14, ℍn approximates the pseudohermitian structure of a general orientable and strictly pseudoconvex CR manifolds (see also [26]). 2010 Mathematics Subject Classification.

2 ELEONORA CINTI AND JINGGANG TAN Given a Kähler-Einstein manifold 𝒳, CR covariant operators of fractional order γ are pseudodifferential operators whose principal symbol agrees with the pure fractional powers of the CR sub-Laplacian on the boundary ℳ=∂⁡𝒳. They can be defined using scattering theory, as done in [12, 22, 21, 20. In the particular case of the Heisenberg group, they are the intertwining operators on the CR sphere, which can be calculated using representation theory techniques (see 8]).

In [16], in order to construct fractional CR covariant operators in the specific case of the Heisenberg group, ℍn is identified with the boundary of the Siegel domain in ℝ2⁢n+2 (see Section 2 for the precise definition) and it is crucial to use its underlying complex hyperbolic structure.

Another possible approach in the construction of fractional powers of the sub-Laplacian consists in using purely functional analytic tools as done by Ferrari and Franchi [15] who proved an extension result for fractional operators defined by using the spectral resolution of the subLaplacian in general Carnot groups, see also [13, 28. The operators considered in [15] are different in nature from the ones in [16], they correspond to the pure fractional powers of the sub-Laplacian and do not enjoy the CR covariance property.

Since it will be of utmost importance in the sequel, we recall here the extension result proven in [16].

Theorem 1.1 (see Theorem 1.1 in [16]). Let γ∈(0,1),a=1-2⁢γ. For each u∈C∞⁢(ℍn), there exists a unique solution ℰγ⁢u=U for the extension problem

	
{∂2⁡U∂⁡λ2+aλ⁢∂⁡U∂⁡λ+λ2⁢∂2⁡U∂⁡t2+12⁢Δℍ⁢U=0	 in ⁢ℍ^+n:=ℍn×ℝ+
U=u	 on ⁢∂⁡ℍ^+n=ℍn×{λ=0}.
	

Moreover,

	
𝒫γ⁢u=-cγ⁢limλ→0⁡λa⁢∂⁡U∂⁡λ,
	

where cγ is a constant depending only on γ which precise value is given by

	
cγ=Γ⁢(γ)γ⁢Γ⁢(-γ)⋅22⁢γ-1.
	

In (1.2) Δℍ denotes the sublaplacian in the Heisenberg group, which precise definition is given in Section 2 below. Observe that, differently from the extension result established in [15], here we have the additional term λ2⁢∂2⁡U∂⁡t2 which appears when one considers CR fractional

NONLOCAL LIOUVILLE THEOREM 3 sub-Laplacian. When a=1/2 the equation in (1.2) satisfied by U becomes:

	
∂2⁡U∂⁡λ2+λ2⁢∂2⁡U∂⁡t2+12⁢Δℍ⁢U=0,
	

and we have

	
𝒫12⁢u=-c12⁢limλ→0⁡∂⁡U∂⁡λ.
	

Replacing λ in (1.3) by 2⁢λ, we will consider the operator

	
ℒ=Δℍ+∂2∂⁡λ2+4⁢λ2⁢∂2∂⁡t2.
	

Our Liouville-type theorem is the analogue, for the fractional operator 𝒫12, of a result by Birindelli and Prajapat [4], for the sublaplacian Δℍ. In [4], the authors establish a nonexistence result for a class of positive solution of the equation

	
-Δℍ⁢u=up,
	

for p subcritical (i.e. 0<p<Q+2Q-2, where Q=2⁢n+2 denotes the homogeneous dimension of ℍn ). The technique they used is based on the moving plane method (which goes back to Alexandrov [1] and Serrin [27]), adapted to the Heisenberg group setting. This method requires two basic tools: the maximum principle and invariance under reflection with respect to a hyperplane. Since the operator -Δℍ is not invariant under the usual reflection with respect to hyperplanes, Birindelli and Prajapat needed to introduce a new reflection, called H-reflection, under which -Δℍ is invariant. Since it will be important in the sequel, we recall here the definition of H-reflection.

Definition 1.2. For any ξ=(x,y,t)∈ℍn, we consider the plane Tμ:={ξ∈ℍn:t=μ}. We define

	
ξμ:=(y,x,2⁢μ-t),
	

to be the H-reflection of ξ with respect to the plane Tμ. Due to the use of this reflection, the proof of the non existence result in [4 requires the solution u of (1.5) to be cylindrical, that is, u⁢(x,y,t)=u⁢(r0,t) must depend only on r0 and t where r0= (|x|2+|y|2)12

We can now state our main result, which is the analogue for the operator 𝒫12 of the Liouville result contained in [4.

4 ELEONORA CINTI AND JINGGANG TAN Theorem 1.3. Let 0<p<Q+1Q-1, where Q=2⁢n+2 is the homogeneous dimension of ℍn. Then there exists no cylindrical solution u∈C2⁢(ℍn) of

	
{𝒫12⁢u=up	 in ⁢ℍn,
u>0	 in ⁢ℍn.
	

Using the local formulation (1.2) established in [16], the above theorem will follow as a corollary of the following Liouville-type result for a nonlinear Neumann problem in the half-space ℍn×ℝ+.

Theorem 1.4. Let 0<p<Q+1Q-1 and U∈C2⁢(ℍn×ℝ+)∩C1⁢(ℍn×ℝ+¯) be a nonnegative solution of

	
{∂2⁡U∂⁡λ2+4⁢λ2⁢∂2⁡U∂⁡t2+Δℍ⁢U=0	 in ⁢ℍn×ℝ+
-∂⁡U∂⁡λ=Up	 on ⁢ℍn×{λ=0}
	

Suppose that U⁢(x,y,t,λ)=U⁢(r0,t,λ) depends only on r0,t,λ, where r0=(|x|2+|y|2)12. Then U≡0.

In the Euclidean case, classical nonexistence results for subcritical nonlinear problems in the all space ℝn are contained in two works by Gidas and Spruck [19] and by Chen and Li [10]. Analogue results for nonlinear Neumann problems in the half-space ℝ+n where established in [24, 25, using the methods of moving planes and moving spheres. In the Heisenberg group setting there are several papers concerning nonexistence results for problem (1.5). Garofalo and Lanconelli [17] proved some nonexistence results for positive solutions of (1.5) when p is subcritical, under some integrability conditions on u and ∇⁡u. In [23, 29] similar nonexistence results for positive solutions of (1.5) in the half-space are established for the critical exponent p=Q+2Q-2. In [5], a Liouville-type result for solution of (1.5) is proved without requiring any decay condition on u, but only for 0<p<QQ-2. As explained before, in [4] Birindelli and Prajapat extends this last result to any 0<p<Q+2Q-2 but only in the class of cylindrical solution. A last more recent result in this context was proven by Xu in [30], who established that there are no positive solution of (1.5) for 0<p<Q⁢(Q+2)(Q-1)2. This result uses a different technique, based on the vector field method, and improves the results contained in [17] and [5], since it does not require any decay on the solution u and it improves the exponent p. Nevertheless it seems not allow to reach the optimal exponent Q+2Q-2 (observe that QQ-2<Q⁢(Q+2)(Q-1)2<Q+2Q-2).

NONLOCAL LIOUVILLE THEOREM 5 In this paper we aim to establish a first Liouville-type result for a C⁢R fractional power of -Δℍ; this is, to our knowledge, the first nonexistence result in this fractional setting.

Let us comment now on the basic tools in the proof of our main result. Following [4], in order to get a nonexistence result, we combine the method of moving planes with the CR inversion of the solution u. The CR inversion was introduced by Jerison and Lee in [26], and it is the analogue of the Kelvin transform, in the Heisenberg group context. In Section 3 we will give the precise definition of CR inversion and we will show which problem is satisfied by the CR inversion of a solution of (1.7).

As said before, the moving plane method is based on several version of the maximum principles. More precisely we will recall the classical Bony’s maximum principle and we will prove two versions of the Hopf’s Lemma (see Propositions 4.3 and 4.6) . The paper is organized as follows: - in Section 2 we recall some basic facts on the Heisenberg group and we will introduce the fractional CR operator 𝒫12; - in Section 3 we will introduce the CR inversion of a function u and prove a lemma concerning the CR inversion of a solution of our problem (1.7); - in Section 4 we establish a maximum principle and Hopf’s Lemma for our operator, which will be basic tools in the method of moving planes; - in Section 5 we will prove our main results Theorems 1.3 and 1.4. 2. Preliminary facts on the Heisenberg group In this section we recall some basic notions and properties concerning the Heisenberg group, see also [6] and [28].

We will denote the points in ℍn using the notation ξ=(x,y,t)= (x1,…,xn,y1,…,yn,t)∈ℝn×ℝn×ℝ. The Heisenberg group ℍn is the space ℝ2⁢n+1 endowed with the group law ∘ defined in the following way:

	
ξ^∘ξ:=(x^+x,y^+y,t^+t+2⁢∑j=1n(xj⁢y^j-yj⁢x^j))
	

The natural dilation of the group is given by δℓ⁢(ξ):=(ℓ⁢x,ℓ⁢y,ℓ2⁢t), and it satisfies δℓ⁢(ξ^∘ξ)=δℓ⁢(ξ^)∘δℓ⁢(ξ).

6 ELEONORA CINTI AND JINGGANG TAN In ℍn we will consider the gauge norm defined as

	
|ξ|ℍ:=[(∑i=1n(xi2+yi2))2+t2]14
	

which is homogeneous of degree one with respect to δℓ. Using this norm, one can define the distance between two points in the natural way:

	
dℍ⁢(ξ^,ξ)=|ξ^-1∘ξ|ℍ,
	

where ξ^-1 denotes the inverse of ξ^ with respect to the group action. We denote the ball associated to the gauge distance by

	
Bℍ⁢(ξ0,R):={ξ∈ℍn:dℍ⁢(ξ,ξ0)<R}.
	

Denoting by |A| the Lebesgue measure of the set A, we have that

	
|Bℍ⁢(ξ0,R)|=|Bℍ⁢(0,R)|=RQ⁢|Bℍ⁢(0,1)|.
	

Here Q=2⁢n+2 denotes the homogeneous dimension of ℍn. For every j=1,⋯,n, we denote by Xj,Yj, and T the following vector fields:

	
Xj=∂∂⁡xj+2⁢yj⁢∂∂⁡t,Yj=∂∂⁡yj-2⁢xj⁢∂∂⁡t,T=∂∂⁡t
	

They form a basis of the Lie Algebra of left invariant vector fields. Moreover, an easy computions shows that [Xk,Yj]=-4⁢δk⁢j⁢T. The Heisenberg gradient of a function f is given by

	
∇ℍ⁡f=(X1⁢f,⋯,Xn⁢f,Y1⁢f,⋯,Yn⁢f)
	

Finally, we define the sublaplacian as

	Δℍ	:=∑j=1n(Xj2+Yj2)	
		=∑j=1n∂2∂⁡xj2+∂2∂⁡yj2+4⁢yj⁢∂2∂⁡xj⁢∂⁡t-4⁢xj⁢∂2∂⁡yj⁢∂⁡t+4⁢(xj2+yj2)⁢∂2∂⁡t2.	

It can be written also in the form Δℍ=div⁡(A¯⁢∇T), where A¯=a¯k⁢j is the (2⁢n+1)×(2⁢n+1) symmetric matrix given by a¯k⁢j=δk⁢j for k,j= 1,…,2⁢n,a¯j⁢(2⁢n+1)=a¯(2⁢n+1)⁢j=2⁢yj for j=1,…,n,a¯j⁢(2⁢n+1)=a¯(2⁢n+1)⁢j= -2⁢xj for j=n+1,…,2⁢n and a¯(2⁢n+1)⁢(2⁢n+1)=4⁢(|x|2+|y|2). It is easy to observe that A¯ is positive semidefinite for any (x,y,t)∈ℍn. This operator is degenerate elliptic, and it is hypoelliptic since it satisfies the Hörmander condition.

NONLOCAL LIOUVILLE THEOREM 7 We pass now to describe CR covariant operators of fractional orders in ℍn. For more precise notions of CR geometry and for the construction of CR covariant fractional powers of the sub-Laplacian on more general CR manifolds, we refer to [16] and references therein. Here we just consider the case of the Heisenberg group, since it is the one of interest.

Introducing complex coordinates ζ=x+i⁢y∈ℂn, we can identify the Heisenberg group ℍn with the boundary of the Siegel domain Ωn+1⊂ ℂn+1, which is given by

	
Ωn+1:={(ζ1,…,ζn+1)=(ζ,ζn+1)∈ℂn×ℂ∣q⁢(ζ,ζn+1)>0},
	

with

	
q⁢(ζ,ζn+1)=Im⁡ζn+1-∑j=1n|ζj|2
	

through the map (ζ,t)∈ℍn→(ζ,t+i⁢|ζ|2)∈∂⁡Ωn+1. It is possible to see that 𝒳=Ωn+1 is a Kähler-Einstein manifold, endowed with a Kähler form ω+(which precise expression can be found in formula (1.4) in [16]), and a corresponding Kähler metric g+(see formula (1.6) in [16]). Using this metric, one can see that Ωn+1 can be identified with the complex hyperbolic space. The boundary manifold ℳ= ∂⁡Ωn+1 inherits a natural CR structure from the complex structure of the ambient manifold. Given a CR structure, it is possible to associate to it a contact form θ, that in the specific case of the Heisenberg group, is given by

	
θ=[d⁢t+12⁢∑j=1n(xj⁢d⁢yj-yj⁢d⁢xj)]
	

This form satisfies θ⁢(T)=1. Scattering theory tells us that for s∈ℂ,Re⁡(s)>m2, and except for a set of exceptional values, given f smooth on ℳ, the eigenvalue equation

	
-Δg+⁢u-s⁢(m-s)⁢u=0, in ⁢𝒳
	

has a solution u with the expansion

	
{u=q(m-s)⁢F+qs⁢G  for some  F,G∈C∞⁢(𝒳¯)
F|ℳ=f
	

The scattering operator is defined as

	
S⁢(s):𝒞∞⁢(ℳ)→𝒞∞⁢(ℳ)
	

by

	
S⁢(s)⁢f:=G|ℳ.
	




8 ELEONORA CINTI AND JINGGANG TAN We set s=m+γ2, for γ∈(0,m)\ℕ. The conformal fractional subLaplacian on ℍn=ℳ (associated to the contact form θ ) is defined in the following way:

	
𝒫γθ⁢f=Cγ⁢S⁢(s)⁢f
	

for a constant

	
Cγ=22⁢γ-1⁢Γ⁢(γ)γ⁢Γ⁢(-γ).
	

For γ=1 and γ=2 we have (see 16] ):

	
P1θ=-Δℍ  and  P2θ=Δℍ2+T2.
	

A crucial property of 𝒫γθ is its conformal covariance. Indeed, if we consider a conformal change of the contact form θ^=w2n+1-γ⁢θ, then the corresponding fractional operator is given by:

	
𝒫γθ^(⋅)=w-n+1+γn+1-γ𝒫γθ(w⋅).
	

For further details on CR covariance and on the geometric properties of the operator 𝒫γθ we refer to [16; here we just emphasize that this covariance property is reflected in the fact that the extension operator ℒ defined in (1.4) well behaves under C⁢R inversion (as we will see later in Section 3), and this will be crucial in the proof of our main result. As explained in the introduction, one of the main result in [16], is the characterization of these fractional operators via the extension problem (1.2). Since throughout this paper we will work on this lifted problem in the extended space, let us introduce some notations in ℍ^n=ℍn×ℝ+. Since, the contact form θ is fixed (and it is the one defined in (2.1)), for simplicity of notations we will write 𝒫γ instead of 𝒫γθ.

Analougsly to ℍn, in ℍ^n we define the following group low (that for simplicity of notation we still denote by ∘ ): for z=(x1,⋯,xn,y1,⋯,yn,t,λ)∈ℍ^n and z^=(x^1,⋯,x^n,y^1,⋯,y^n,t^,λ^)∈ ℍ^n, we set

	
z^∘z:=(x^+x,y^+y,t^+t+2⁢∑j=1n(xj⁢y^j-yj⁢x^j),λ^+λ)⁢. 
	

Moreover we consider the norm given by

	
|z|ℍn:=[(|x|2+|y|2+λ2)2+t2]14.
	

Finally we denote the distance dℍ^ between z and z^, by

	
dℍ^⁢(z,z^):=|z^-1∘z|ℍ^n.
	




NONLOCAL LIOUVILLE THEOREM 9 Observe that when λ=λ^=0, that is z and z^ belong to ℍn,dℍ^⁢(z,z^)= dℍ⁢(z,z^). Moreover, given z¯∈ℍ^n we set

	
ℬ⁢(z¯,R)={z∈ℂn+1∣dℍ^⁢(z,z¯)<R}
	

and for any z0∈ℍn×{0} we denote

	
ℬ+⁢(z0,R)={z∈ℍn×ℝ+∣dℍ^⁢(z,z0)<R,λ>0}
	

The operator ℒ (defined in (1.4)), writing explicitly all the terms, becomes

	ℒ=	∂2∂⁡λ2+∑j=1n(∂2∂⁡xj2+∂2∂⁡yj2+4⁢yj⁢∂2∂⁡xj⁢∂⁡t-4⁢xj⁢∂2∂⁡yj⁢∂⁡t)	
		+4⁢(λ2+∑j=1n(xj2+yj2))⁢∂2∂⁡t2	

Also in this case, we can write ℒ=div⁡(A⁢∇T), where now A is the (2n+ 2)×(2n+2) symmetric matrix given by ak⁢j=δk⁢j if k,j=1,⋯,2⁢n, aj⁢(2⁢n+1)=a(2⁢n+1)⁢j=2⁢yj if j=1,⋯,n,aj⁢(2⁢n+1)=a(2⁢n+1)⁢j=-2⁢xj if j=n+1,⋯,2⁢n,a(2⁢n+1)⁢(2⁢n+1)=4⁢(|x|2+|y|2+λ2),a(2⁢n+2)⁢(2⁢n+2)=1, aj⁢(2⁢n+2)=a(2⁢n+2)⁢j=0 if j=1,⋯,2⁢n+1.

In the sequel it will be useful to express ℒ for cylindrical and radial functions. For a point z=(x,y,t,λ)∈ℍ^n, let

	
r=(|x|2+|y|2+λ2)1/2,
ρ=(r4+t2)1/4
	

Suppose that Ψ is a radial function, that is, Ψ depends only on ρ; then a direct computation gives:

	∂⁡Ψ∂⁡xj	=∂⁡Ψ∂⁡ρ⁢∂⁡ρ∂⁡xj=ρ-3⁢r2⁢xj⁢∂⁡Ψ∂⁡ρ,∂⁡Ψ∂⁡yj=∂⁡Ψ∂⁡ρ⁢∂⁡ρ∂⁡yj=ρ-3⁢r2⁢yj⁢∂⁡Ψ∂⁡ρ	
	∂⁡Ψ∂⁡λ	=∂⁡Ψ∂⁡ρ⁢∂⁡ρ∂⁡λ=ρ-3⁢r2⁢λ⁢∂⁡Ψ∂⁡ρ	




10 ELEONORA CINTI AND JINGGANG TAN Then we deduce that

	∂2⁡Ψ∂⁡xj2	=r4⁢xj2ρ6⁢∂2⁡Ψ∂⁡ρ2+ρ4⁢r2+2⁢ρ4⁢xj2-3⁢r4⁢xj2ρ7⁢∂⁡Ψ∂⁡ρ	
	∂2⁡Ψ∂⁡yj2	=r4⁢yj2ρ6⁢∂2⁡Ψ∂⁡ρ2+ρ4⁢r2+2⁢ρ4⁢yj2-3⁢r4⁢yj2ρ7⁢∂⁡Ψ∂⁡ρ	
	∂2⁡Ψ∂⁡λ2	=r4⁢λ2ρ6⁢∂2⁡Ψ∂⁡ρ2+ρ4⁢r2+2⁢ρ4⁢λ2-3⁢r4⁢λ2ρ7⁢∂⁡Ψ∂⁡ρ	
	∂2⁡Ψ∂⁡t2	=t24⁢ρ6⁢∂2⁡Ψ∂⁡ρ2+2⁢ρ4-3⁢t24⁢ρ7⁢∂⁡Ψ∂⁡ρ	

Hence, by using that

	
1ρ6⁢(∑j=1n(r4⁢xj2+r4⁢yj2)+r4⁢λ2+r2⁢t2)=r2ρ2
	

and

		1ρ7⁢[(2⁢n+1)⁢ρ4⁢r2+(2⁢ρ4-3⁢r4+(2⁢ρ4-3⁢t2))⁢(∑j=1n(xj2+yj2)+λ2)]	
	=	1ρ7⁢[(2⁢n+1)⁢ρ4⁢r2+2⁢ρ4⁢r2-3⁢r6+r2⁢(2⁢ρ4-3⁢t2)]=Q⁢r2ρ3,	

we conclude that

	
ℒ⁢Ψ⁢(ρ)=r2ρ2⁢(d2⁢Ψ⁢(ρ)d⁢ρ2+Qρ⁢d⁢Ψ⁢(ρ)d⁢ρ).
	

In a similar way, we deduce that for a cylindrical symmetric function ϕ=ϕ⁢(r,t)

	
ℒ⁢ϕ=∂2⁡ϕ∂⁡r2+Q-2r⁢∂⁡ϕ∂⁡r+4⁢r2⁢∂2⁡ϕ∂⁡t2.
	

Using the radial form (2.3) for ℒ, an easy computation yields the following lemma.

Lemma 2.1. Let ψ⁢(ρ)=1ρQ-1=1ρ2⁢n+1 for ρ≠0. Then we have that

	
{ℒ⁢ψ⁢(ρ)=0	 in ⁢ℍn×ℝ+\{0}
-∂∂⁡λ⁢ψ⁢(ρ)=0	 on ⁢ℍn×{λ=0}\{0}
	




NONLOCAL LIOUVILLE THEOREM 11 3. CR Inversion Following [4] and [26], we define the CR inversion in the half-space ℍ^+n=ℍn×ℝ+

For any (x,y,t,λ)∈ℍ^+n, let as before r=(|x|2+|y|2+λ2)12 and ρ=(r4+t2)14. We set

	
x~i=xi⁢t+yi⁢r2ρ4,y~i=yi⁢t-xi⁢r2ρ4,t~=-tρ4,λ~=λρ2.
	

The CR inversion of a function U defined on ℍ^+n, is given by

	
v⁢(x,y,t,λ)=1ρQ-1⁢U⁢(x~,y~,t~,λ~).
	

The following lemma shows which equation is satisfied by the CR inversion of a solution of problem (1.7).

Lemma 3.1. Suppose that U∈C2⁢(ℍ^+n)∩C⁢(ℍ^+n¯) is a solution of (1.7) . Then the C⁢R inversion v of U satisfies

	
{ℒ⁢v=0	 in ⁢ℍ^+n⁢{0},
-∂⁡v∂⁡λ=ρp⁢(Q-1)-(Q+1)⁢vp	 on ⁢ℍn×{λ=0}\{0}.
	","Aвstract. We establish a Liouville-type theorem for a subcritical nonlinear problem, involving a fractional power of the sub-Laplacian in the Heisenberg group. To prove our result we will use the local realization of fractional CR covariant operators, which can be constructed as the Dirichlet-to-Neumann operator of a degenerate elliptic equation in the spirit of Caffarelli and Silvestre [8], as established in [14]. The main tools in our proof are the CR inversion and the moving plane method, applied to the solution of the lifted problem in the half-space ℍn×ℝ+. 2010 MSC. Primary: 35A01,35B50,35J70.

INTRODUCTION In these notes we establish a Liouville-type result for the following nonlinear and nonlocal problem in the Heisenberg group:

	
𝒫12⁢u=up  in ⁢ℍn⁢. 
	

Here 𝒫12 denotes a CR covariant operator of order 1/2 in ℍn, whose principal symbols agree with the pure fractional power 1/2 of the Heisenberg Laplacian -Δℍ (see (2.1) for the precise definition of -Δℍ). In [14] the authors study CR covariant operators of fractional orders on orientable and strictly pseudoconvex CR manifolds. In this context, the Heisenberg group ℍn plays the same role as ℝn in conformal geometry, see also [24].

128 ELEONORA CINTI Given a Kähler-Einstein manifold 𝒳, CR covariant operators of fractional order γ are pseudodifferential operators whose principal symbol agrees with the pure fractional powers of the CR sub-Laplacian on the boundary ℳ=∂⁡𝒳. They can be defined using scattering theory, as done in [12,20,19,18].

One of the main results in [14] establishes that it is possible to characterize fractional CR covariant operators on some CR manifold ℳ=∂⁡𝒳, as the Dirichlet-to-Neumann map of a degenerate elliptic equation in the interior of 𝒳 as in [8].

To construct fractional CR covariant operators in the specific case of the Heisenberg group, ℍn is identified with the boundary of the Siegel domain in ℝ2⁢n+2 (see Section 2 for the precise definition) and it is crucial to use its underlying complex hyperbolic structure ( see [14]).

Since it will be of utmost importance in the sequel, we recall here the extension result proven in [14].

Theorem 1.1 (see Theorem 1.1 in [14]). Let γ∈(0,1),a=1-2⁢γ. For each u∈C∞⁢(ℍn), there exists a unique solution U for the extension problem

	
{∂2⁡U∂⁡λ2+aλ⁢∂⁡U∂⁡λ+λ2⁢∂2⁡U∂⁡t2+12⁢Δℍ⁢U=0	 in ⁢ℍ^+n:=ℍn×ℝ+,
U=u	 on ⁢ℍn×{λ=0}
	

Moreover,

	
𝒫γ⁢u=-cγ⁢limλ→0⁡λa⁢∂⁡U∂⁡λ
	

where cγ is a constant depending only on γ which precise value is given by

	
cγ=-Γ⁢(γ)γ⁢Γ⁢(-γ)⋅22⁢γ-1.
	

Observe that, differently from the extension result established in [13], here we have the additional term λ2⁢∂2⁡U∂⁡t2 which appears when one considers CR fractional sub-Laplacian. When a=1/2 the equation in (1.2) satisfied by U becomes:

	
∂2⁡U∂⁡λ2+λ2⁢∂2⁡U∂⁡t2+12⁢Δℍ⁢U=0,
	

and we have

	
𝒫12⁢u=-c12⁢limλ→0⁡∂⁡U∂⁡λ.
	




A LIOUVILLE THEOREM FOR NONLOCAL EQUATIONS IN THE HEISENBERG GROUP 129 Replacing λ by 2⁢λ in (1.3), we will consider the operator

	
ℒ=Δℍ+∂2∂⁡λ2+4⁢λ2⁢∂2∂⁡t2.
	

Our Liouville-type theorem is the analogue, for the fractional operator 𝒫12, of a result contained in [4], for the sublaplacian Δℍ. In [4], the authors establish a nonexistence result for a class of positive solution of the equation

	
-Δℍ⁢u=up,
	

for p subcritical (i.e. 0<p<Q+2Q-2, where Q=2⁢n+2 denotes the homogeneous dimension of ℍn ). The technique they used is based on the moving plane method (which goes back to Alexandrov [1] and Serrin [25]), adapted to the Heisenberg group setting. This method requires two basic tools: the maximum principle and invariance under reflection with respect to a hyperplane. Since the operator -Δℍ is not invariant under the usual reflection, in [4] a new reflection, called H-reflection, was introduced. Since it will be important in the sequel, we recall here the definition of H-reflection.

Definition 1.2. For any ξ=(x,y,t)∈ℍn, we consider the plane Tμ:={ξ∈ℍn:t= μ}. We define

	
ξμ:=(y,x,2⁢μ-t),
	

to be the H-reflection of ξ with respect to the plane Tμ. Due to the use of this reflection, the proof of the nonexistence result in [4] requires the solution u of (1.5) to be cylindrical, that is, u⁢(x,y,t)=u⁢(r0,t) must depend only on r0 and t where r0=(|x|2+|y|2)12.

We can now state our main result, which is the analogue for the operator 𝒫12 of the Liouville result contained in [4].

Theorem 1.3. Let 0<p<Q+1Q-1, where Q=2⁢n+2 is the homogeneous dimension of ℍn. Then there exists no cylindrical solution u∈C2⁢(ℍn) of

	
{𝒫12⁢u=up	 in ⁢ℍn
u>0	 in ⁢ℍn
	




130 ELEONORA CINTI Using the local formulation (1.2) established in [14], the above theorem will follow as a corollary of the following Liouville-type result for a nonlinear Neumann problem in the half-space ℍn×ℝ+.

Theorem 1.4. Let 0<p<Q+1Q-1 and let U∈C2⁢(ℍn×ℝ+)∩C1⁢(ℍn×ℝ+¯)be a nonnegative solution of

	
{∂2⁡U∂⁡λ2+4⁢λ2⁢∂2⁡U∂⁡t2+Δℍ⁢U=0	 in ⁢ℍn×ℝ+
-∂⁡U∂⁡λ=Up	 on ⁢ℍn×{λ=0}
	

Suppose that U⁢(x,y,t,λ)=U⁢(r0,t,λ), that is U depends only on r0,t,λ, where r0= (|x|2+|y|2)12. Then U≡0

In the Euclidean case, classical nonexistence results for subcritical nonlinear problems in the all space ℝn are contained in [17] and [9]. Analogue results for nonlinear Neumann problems in the half-space ℝ+n where established in [22, 23], using the methods of moving planes and moving spheres.

In the Heisenberg group setting there are several papers concerning nonexistence results for problem (1.5). In [15] some nonexistence results for positive solutions of (1.5) when p is subcritical were established, under some integrability conditions on u and ∇⁡u. In [21,27] similar nonexistence results for positive solutions of (1.5) in the half-space are established for the critical exponent p=Q+2Q-2. In [5], a Liouville-type result for solution of (1.5) is proved without requiring any decay condition on u, but only for 0<p<QQ-2. In [4] the authors extend this last result to any 0<p<Q+2Q-2 but only in the class of cylindrical solution. A last more recent result in this context was proven in [28], who established that there are no positive solution of (1.5) for 0<p<Q⁢(Q+2)(Q-1)2. This result uses a different technique, based on the vector field method, and improves the results contained in [15] and [5], since it does not require any decay on the solution u and it improves the exponent p. Nevertheless it seems that it does not allow to reach the optimal exponent Q+2Q-2 (observe that QQ-2<Q⁢(Q+2)(Q-1)2<Q+2Q-2).

In this note we aim to establish a first Liouville-type result for a CR fractional power of -Δℍ; this is, to our knowledge, the first nonexistence result in this fractional setting.

A LIOUVILLE THEOREM FOR NONLOCAL EQUATIONS IN THE HEISENBERG GROUP 131 Let us comment now the basic tools in the proof of our main result. Following [4], in order to get a nonexistence result, we combine the method of moving planes with the CR inversion of the solution u.

The CR inversion was introduced in [24], and it is the analogue of the Kelvin transform, in the Heisenberg group context. In Section 3 we will give the precise definition of CR inversion and we will show which problem is satisfied by the CR inversion of a solution of (1.7).

As said before, the moving plane method is based on several version of the maximum principles. More precisely we will need to prove that our operator satisfies a weak maximum principle and two versions of the Hopf Lemma (see Propositions 4.3 and 4.6). The note is organized as follows: - in Section 2 we recall some basic facts on the Heisenberg group and we will introduce the fractional CR operator 𝒫12; - in Section 3 we will introduce the CR inversion of a function u and state a lemma concerning the CR inversion of a solution of our problem (1.7); - in Section 4 we establish a maximum principles and Hopf Lemma for our operator, which will be basic tools in the method of moving plane; - in Section 5 we will prove our main result (Theorem 1.4). 2. Preliminary facts on the Heisenberg Group In this section we recall some basic notions and properties concerning the Heisenberg group (see Chapter 3 in [6] and Chapter XII in [26]).

We will denote the points in ℍn using the notation ξ=(x,y,t)=(x1,…,xn,y1,…,yn,t)∈ ℝn×ℝn×ℝ. The Heisenberg group ℍn is the space ℝ2⁢n+1 endowed with the group law o defined in the following way:

	
ξ^∘ξ:=(x^+x,y^+y,t^+t+2⁢∑j=1n(xj⁢y^j-yj⁢x^j))⁢. 
	

The natural dilation of the group is given by δℓ⁢(ξ):=(ℓ⁢x,ℓ⁢y,ℓ2⁢t), and it satisfies δℓ⁢(ξ^∘ξ)= δℓ⁢(ξ^)∘δℓ⁢(ξ)

132 ELEONORA CINTI In ℍn we will consider the gauge norm defined as

	
|ξ|ℍ:=[(∑i=1n(xi2+yi2))2+t2]14,
	

which is homogeneous of degree one with respect to δℓ. Using this norm, one can define the distance between two points in the natural way:

	
dℍ⁢(ξ^,ξ)=|ξ^-1∘ξ|ℍ,
	

where ξ^-1 denotes the inverse of ξ^ with respect to the group action. We denote the ball associated to the gauge distance by

	
Bℍ⁢(ξ0,R):={ξ∈ℍn:dℍ⁢(ξ,ξ0)<R}.
	

Denoting by |A| the Lebesgue measure of the set A, we have that

	
|Bℍ⁢(ξ0,R)|=|Bℍ⁢(0,R)|=RQ⁢|Bℍ⁢(0,1)|
	

Here Q=2⁢n+2 denotes the homogeneous dimension of ℍn. For every j=1,⋯,n, we denote by Xj,Yj, and T the following vector fields:

	
Xj=∂∂⁡xj+2⁢yj⁢∂∂⁡t,Yj=∂∂⁡yj-2⁢xj⁢∂∂⁡t,T=∂∂⁡t.
	

They form a basis of the Lie Algebra of left invariant vector fields. Moreover, an easy computions shows that [Xk,Yj]=-4⁢δk⁢j⁢T. The Heisenberg gradient of a function f is given by

	
∇ℍ⁡f=(X1⁢f,⋯,Xn⁢f,Y1⁢f,⋯,Yn⁢f)
	

Finally, we define the sublaplacian as

	
Δℍ:=∑j=1n(Xj2+Yj2).
	

It can be written also in the form Δℍ=div⁡(A¯⁢∇T), where A¯=a¯k⁢j is the (2⁢n+1)×(2⁢n+1) symmetric matrix given by a¯k⁢j=δk⁢j for k,j=1,…,2⁢n,a¯j⁢(2⁢n+1)=a¯(2⁢n+1)⁢j=2⁢yj for j=1,…,n,a¯j⁢(2⁢n+1)=a¯(2⁢n+1)⁢j=-2⁢xj for j=n+1,…,2⁢n and a¯(2⁢n+1)⁢(2⁢n+1)=4⁢(|x|2+|y|2). It is easy to observe that A¯ is positive semidefinite for any (x,y,t)∈ℍn. This operator is degenerate elliptic, and it is hypoelliptic since it satisfies the Hormander condition.

A LiOUVILLE THEOREM FOR NONLOCAL EQUATIONS IN THE HEISENBERG GROUP 133 We pass now to describe CR covariant operators of fractional orders in ℍn. For more precise notions of CR geometry and for the construction of CR covariant fractional powers of the sub-Laplacian on more general CR manifolds, we refer to [14] and references therein. Here we just consider the case of the Heisenberg group, since it is the one of interest. Introducing complex coordinates ζ=x+i⁢y∈ℂn, we can identify the Heisenberg group ℍn with the boundary of the Siegel domain Ωn+1⊂ℂn+1, which is given by

	
Ωn+1:={(ζ1,…,ζn+1)=(ζ,ζn+1)∈ℂn×ℂ∣q⁢(ζ,ζn+1)>0},
	

with

	
q⁢(ζ,ζn+1)=Im⁡ζn+1-∑j=1n|ζj|2
	

through the map (ζ,t)∈ℍn→(ζ,t+i⁢|ζ|2)∈∂⁡Ωn+1. It is possible to see that 𝒳=Ωn+1 is a Kähler-Einstein manifold, endowed with a Kähler metric g+, which can be identified with the complex hyperbolic space. The boundary manifold ℳ=∂⁡Ωn+1 inherits a natural CR structure from the complex structure of the ambient manifold.

Scattering theory tells us that for s∈ℂ,Re⁡(s)≥m2, and except for a set of exceptional values, given f smooth on ℳ, the eigenvalue equation

	
-Δg+⁢u-s⁢(m-s)⁢u=0, in ⁢𝒳
	

has a solution u with the expansion

	
{u=q(m-s)⁢F+qs⁢G⁢ for some  F,G∈C∞⁢(𝒳¯),
F|ℳ=f
	

The scattering operator is defined as

	
S⁢(s):𝒞∞⁢(ℳ)→𝒞∞⁢(ℳ)
	

by

	
S⁢(s)⁢f:=G|ℳ
	

We set s=m+γ2, for γ∈(0,m)\ℕ. The conformal fractional sub-Laplacian on ℍn is defined in the following way:

	
𝒫γ⁢f=Cγ⁢S⁢(s)⁢f,
	




134 ELEONORA CINTI for a constant

	
Cγ=22⁢γ-1⁢Γ⁢(γ)γ⁢Γ⁢(-γ).
	

For γ=1 and γ=2 we have:

	
P1=-Δℍ  and  P2=Δℍ2+T2.
	

A crucial property of 𝒫γ is its conformal covariance. As explained in the introduction, one of the main result in [14], is the characterization of these fractional operators via the extension problem (1.2). Throughout this paper, we will work on this lifted problem in the extended space, let us introduce some notations also in this setting.

Analougsly to ℍn, in ℍ^n we define the following group low (that for simplicity of notation we still denote by ∘ ): for z=(x1,⋯,xn,y1,⋯,yn,t,λ)∈ℍ^n and z^=(x^1,⋯,x^n,y^1,⋯,y^n,t^,λ^)∈ℍ^n, we set

	
z^∘z:=(x^+x,y^+y,t^+t+2⁢∑j=1n(xj⁢y^j-yj⁢x^j),λ^+λ)
	

Moreover we consider the norm given by

	
|z|ℍn:=[(|x|2+|y|2+λ2)2+t2]14
	

Finally we denote the distance dℍ^ between z and z^, by

	
dℍ^⁢(z,z^):=|z^-1∘z|ℍn.
	

Observe that when λ=λ^=0, that is z and z^ belong to ℍn,dℍ^⁢(z,z^)=dℍ⁢(z,z^). Moreover, given z¯∈ℍ^n we set

	
ℬ⁢(z¯,R)={z∈ℂn+1∣dℍ^⁢(z,z¯)<R}
	

and for any z0∈ℍn×{0} we denote

	
ℬ+⁢(z0,R)={z∈ℍn×ℝ+∣dℍ^⁢(z,z0)<R,λ>0}.
	

The operator ℒ, writing explicitly all the terms, becomes

	
ℒ=∂2∂⁡λ2+∑j=1n(∂2∂⁡xj2+∂2∂⁡yj2+4⁢yj⁢∂2∂⁡xj⁢∂⁡t-4⁢xj⁢∂2∂⁡yj⁢∂⁡t)
	




A LiOUVILLE THEOREM FOR NONLOCAL EQUATIONS IN THE HEISENBERG GROUP 135

	
+4⁢(λ2+∑j=1n(xj2+yj2))⁢∂2∂⁡t2.
	

Also in this case, we can write ℒ=div⁡(A⁢∇T), where now A is the (2⁢n+2)×(2⁢n+2) symmetric matrix given by ak⁢j=δk⁢j if k,j=1,⋯,2⁢n,aj⁢(2⁢n+1)=a(2⁢n+1)⁢j=2⁢yj if j= 1,⋯,n,aj⁢(2⁢n+1)=a(2⁢n+1)⁢j=-2⁢xj if j=n+1,⋯,2⁢n,a(2⁢n+1)⁢(2⁢n+1)=4⁢(|x|2+|y|2+λ2), a(2⁢n+2)⁢(2⁢n+2)=1,aj⁢(2⁢n+2)=a(2⁢n+2)⁢j=0 if j=1,⋯,2⁢n. In the sequel it will be useful to express ℒ for cylindrical and radial functions. Let

	
r=(|x|2+|y|2+λ2)1/2,
ρ=(r4+t2)1/4
	

Suppose that Ψ is a radial function, that is, Ψ depends only on ρ; then a direct computations gives:

	
ℒ⁢Ψ⁢(ρ)=r2ρ2⁢(∂2⁡Ψ⁢(ρ)∂⁡ρ2+Qρ⁢∂⁡Ψ⁢(ρ)∂⁡ρ).
	

In a similar way, we deduce that for cylindrical symmetric functions ϕ=ϕ⁢(r,t), we have

	
ℒ⁢ϕ=∂2⁡ϕ∂⁡r2+Q-2r⁢∂⁡ϕ∂⁡r+4⁢r2⁢∂2⁡ϕ∂⁡t2
	

Using the radial form (2.3) for ℒ, an easy computation yelds the following lemma. Lemma 2.1 (See [11]). For ρ≠0, let ψ⁢(ρ)=1ρQ-1=1ρ2⁢n+1. Then we have that

	
{ℒ⁢ψ⁢(ρ)=0	∈ℍn×ℝ+\{0}
-∂∂⁡λ⁢ψ⁢(ρ)=0	 on ⁢ℍn\{0}×{λ=0}
	

3. CR INVERSION Following [4] and [24], we define the CR inversion in the half-space ℍn×ℝ+. For any (x,y,t,λ)∈ℍn×ℝ+, let as before r=(|x|2+|y|2+λ2)12 and ρ=(r4+t2)14. We set

	
x~i=xi⁢t+yi⁢r2ρ4,y~i=yi⁢t-xi⁢r2ρ4,t~=-tρ4,λ~=λρ2
	




136 ELEONORA CINTI The CR inversion of a function U defined on ℍn×ℝ+, is given by

	
v⁢(x,y,t,λ)=1ρQ-1⁢U⁢(x~,y~,t~,λ~).
	

The following lemma shows which equation is satisfied by the CR inversion of a solution of problem (1.7).",1332.35374.tex,1330.35490.tex,Deletions; Insertions; Paraphrase
"Proof. Since it is just a long computation, we will give the details of the proof for cylindrical solutions U⁢(r,t), but the statement holds true for any solution. It is clear that

	
r~2=|x~|2+|y~|2+λ~2=t2⁢(|x|2+|y|2+λ2)ρ8+r4⁢(|x|2+|y|2+λ2)ρ8=r2ρ4,
	

and

	
ρ~=(|r~|4+t~2)12=1ρ.
	

In the same way:

	
r0~2=|x~|2+|y~|2=r02ρ4.
	

Therefore, if U depends only on (r,t) (respectively on (r0,t,λ) ), then so does also v. The following relations are useful

	
∂⁡r~∂⁡r=t2-r4ρ6,∂⁡r~∂⁡t=-r⁢tρ6
∂⁡t~∂⁡r=4⁢t⁢r3ρ8,∂⁡t~∂⁡t=2⁢t2-t2-r4ρ8=t2-r4ρ8.

a3=1ρQ+15⁢[16⁢r6⁢t2+4⁢r2⁢(t2-r4)2]=1ρQ+3⁢4⁢r2ρ4.

∂∂⁡t⁢(-r⁢tρ6)=-r⁢(t2+r4)ρ10+3⁢r⁢t2ρ10
	

we can see that

4. Maximum PRINCIPLE And HoPF’S LEMMA Basic tools in the method of moving planes are the maximum principle and Hopf’s Lemma. We start by recalling the classical maximum principle for Hörmander-type operators due to Bony [7].

Proposition 4.1. (7]) Let 𝒱 be a bounded domain in ℍ^n, let Z be a smooth vector field on 𝒱 and let a be a smooth nonnegative function. Assume that U∈C2⁢(𝒱)∩C1⁢(𝒱¯) is a solution of

	
{-ℒ⁢U+Z⁢(z)⁢U+a⁢(z)⁢U≥0	 in ⁢𝒱,
U≥0	 on ⁢∂⁡𝒱.
	

Then U≥0 in 𝒱. We prove now two Hopf’s Lemmas. The first one is Hopf’s Lemma for the operator ℒ in a subset 𝒱 of ℍ^n. We first define the interior ball condition in this setting.

Definition 4.2. Let 𝒱⊂ℍ^n. We say that 𝒱 satisfies the interior dℍ^- ball condition at P∈∂⁡𝒱 if there exist a constant R>0 and a point z0∈𝒱, such that the ball ℬ⁢(z0,R)⊂𝒱 and P∈∂⁡ℬ⁢(z0,R), where ℬ⁢(z0,R)={z∈ℍ^n∣dℍ^⁢(z,z0)<R}.

Lemma 4.3. Let 𝒱⊂ℍ^n satisfy the interior dℍ^-ball condition at the point P0∈∂⁡𝒱 and let U∈C2⁢(𝒱)∩C1⁢(𝒱¯), be a solution of

	
-ℒ⁢U≥c1⁢(z)⁢U⁢ in ⁢𝒱
	

with c1∈L∞⁢(𝒱). Suppose that U⁢(z)>U⁢(P0)=0 for every z∈𝒱. Then

	
lims→0⁡U⁢(P0)-U⁢(P0-s⁢ν)s<0.
	

where ν is the outer normal to ∂⁡𝒱 in P0. Remark 4.4. We observe that if the function c1 in Lemma 4.3 is identically zero, then we can drop the assumption U⁢(P0)=0.

NONLOCAL LIOUVILLE THEOREM 15 Proof. By assumption, there exist a point z0=(x^1,…,x^n,y^1,…,y^n,t^,λ^) and a radius R>0 such that the ball ℬ⁢(z0,R)⊂𝒱 and P0∈∂⁡ℬ⁢(z0,R). We consider the function ψ=U⁢e-K⁢(x1-x^1)2, for K>0 An easy computation yields

	
∂2⁡ψ∂⁡x12=e-K⁢(x1-x^1)2⁢[4⁢K2⁢(x1-x^1)2⁢U-2⁢K⁢U-4⁢K⁢(x1-x^1)⁢∂⁡U∂⁡x1+∂2⁡U∂⁡x12]
 and 
∂2⁡ψ∂⁡xj2=e-K⁢(x1-x^1)2⁢∂2⁡U∂⁡xj2,∂2⁡ψ∂⁡yk2=e-K⁢(x1-x^1)2⁢∂2⁡U∂⁡yk2
∂2⁡ψ∂⁡λ2=e-K⁢(x1-x^1)2⁢∂2⁡U∂⁡λ2
 where ⁢j=2,⋯,n,k=1,⋯,n
 Moreover, 
∂2⁡ψ∂⁡x1⁢∂⁡t=e-K⁢(x1-x^1)2⁢[-2⁢K⁢(x1-x^1)⁢∂⁡U∂⁡t+∂2⁡U∂⁡x1⁢∂⁡t]
∂2⁡ψ∂⁡xj⁢∂⁡t=e-K⁢(x1-x^1)2⁢∂2⁡U∂⁡xj⁢∂⁡t
	

Therefore, we have

	
ℒ⁢ψ+4⁢K⁢(x1-x^1)⁢X1⁢ψ=e-K⁢(x1-x^1)2⁢[-4⁢K2⁢(x1-x^1)2⁢U+ℒ⁢U-2⁢K⁢U]
	

and hence for K sufficiently large, we deduce

	
-ℒ⁢ψ-4⁢K⁢(x1-x^1)⁢X1⁢ψ≥0
	

We introduce now the function ϕ=e-α⁢R2-e-α⁢ρ2, where ρ= dℍ^⁢(z,z0), and 0<ρ<R. Since ϕ depends only on the distance from z0, and ℒ and X1 are invariant with respect to the group action in ℍ^n, we can use formula (2.3) where now ρ=dℍ^⁢(z0-1∘z,0), and the factor r2ρ2 is replaced by the function G⁢(z0-1∘z), where

	
G⁢(x1,…,xn,y1,…,yn,t,λ):=∑j=1n(xj2+yj2)+λ2[(∑j=1n(xj2+yj2)+λ2)2+t2]12⁢. 
	

Choosing α sufficiently large, we have

	-	ℒ⁢ϕ-4⁢K⁢(x1-x^1)⁢X1⁢ϕ	
		=[G(z0-1∘z)(4α2ρ2-2(Q+1)α)	
		-8Kα(x1-x^1)ρX1ρ]e-α⁢ρ2≥0	




16 ELEONORA CINTI AND JINGGANG TAN Let 𝒜:=ℬ⁢(z0,R)\ℬ⁢(z0,R1) for 0<R1<R. For ε small enough

	
ψ⁢(z)+ε⁢ϕ⁢(z)≥0  in ⁢∂⁡𝒜:=∂⁡ℬ⁢(z0,R)∪∂⁡ℬ⁢(z0,R1)⁢. 
	

Then, by Proposition 4.1 we obtain that ψ⁢(z)+ε⁢ϕ⁢(z)≥0 in 𝒜. Therefore, using that ψ⁢(P0)=ϕ⁢(P0)=0, we deduce that for s small

	
ψ⁢(P0)-ψ⁢(P0-s⁢ν)+ε⁢(ϕ⁢(P0)-ϕ⁢(P0-s⁢ν))≤0.
	

Using that ϕ is strictly increasing in ρ, we deduce

	
lims→0⁡ψ⁢(P0)-ψ⁢(P0-s⁢ν)s<0
	

which, in turn, implies that

	
lims→0⁡U⁢(P0-s⁢ν)-U⁢(P0)s<0.
	

For any Ω⊂ℍn, we denote by 𝒞 the infinite cylinder

	
𝒞=Ω×(0,+∞)
	

Before proving our second Hopf’s Lemma, let us recall the notion of interior ball condition in the Heisenberg group.

Definition 4.5. Let Ω⊂ℍn. We say that Ω satisfies the interior Heisenberg ball condition at ξ∈∂⁡Ω if there exist a constant R>0 and a point ξ0∈Ω, such that the Heisenberg ball Bℍ⁢(ξ0,R)⊂Ω and ξ∈∂⁡Bℍ⁢(ξ0,R).

Lemma 4.6. Let Ω⊂ℍn satisfy the interior Heisenberg ball condition at the point P∈∂⁡Ω and let U∈C2⁢(𝒞)∩C1⁢(𝒞¯), be a nonnegative solution of

	
{-ℒ⁢U≥c1⁢(z)⁢U	 in ⁢𝒞
-∂λ⁡U≥c2⁢(ξ)⁢U	 on ⁢Ω
	

with c1,c2∈L∞⁢(𝒞) and c1 is nonnegative. Suppose that U⁢((P,0))=0 and U is not identically null. Then

	
∂ν⁡U⁢(P,0)<0,
	

where ν is the outer normal to ∂⁡Ω in P. Proof. We follow the proof of Lemma 2.4 in [11]. By the strong maximum principle and by Lemma 4.3, we have that

	
U>0⁢ on ⁢𝒞∪Ω.
	




NONLOCAL LIOUVILLE THEOREM 17 Indeed, the strong maximum principle ensures that U>0 in 𝒞, moreover U cannot vanish at a point in Ω, otherwise at this point the Neumann condition would be violated by Lemma 4.3. We start by proving the lemma in the case c1⁢(z)=c2⁢(ξ)≡0. Since Ω satisfies the interior Heisenberg ball condition at P, there exist z0∈Ω×{0} and R>0, such that the ball ℬ+⁢(z0,R) is contained in the cylinder 𝒞 and (∂⁡𝒞∩{λ>0}¯)∩∂⁡ℬ+⁢(z0,R)={(P,0)}. We consider the set

	
𝒜=(ℬ+⁢(z0,R)\ℬ+⁢(z0,R/2)¯)∩{λ>0}
	

We observe that {(P,0)}=∂⁡𝒜∩∂⁡𝒞∩{λ>0}¯. For z∈𝒜 we consider the function η⁢(z)=e-α⁢ρ2-e-α⁢R2, where ρ=dℍ^⁢(z,z0). Writing ℒ in radial coordinates as in (2.3), we have that

	
ℒ⁢η⁢(ρ)=G⁢(z0-1∘z)⁢(4⁢α2⁢ρ2-2⁢(Q+1)⁢α)⁢e-α⁢ρ2,
	

where G is defined as in (4.4). Therefore, for α sufficiently large, we have that

	
-ℒ⁢η≤0
	

By (4.7) we deduce that U>0 on ∂⁡ℬ+⁢(z0,R/2)∩{λ≥0}. Hence, we may choose ε>0 such that

	
U-ε⁢η≥0  on ⁢∂⁡ℬ+⁢(z0,R/2)∩{λ≥0}
	

Claim: U-ε⁢η≥0 in 𝒜. Indeed, using (4.8), we deduce that -ℒ⁢(U-ε⁢η)≥0 in 𝒜. Hence, by the maximum principle, we have that the minimum of U-ε⁢η is attained only on ∂⁡𝒜 (unless U-ε⁢η is constant). Now, on one side we have that

	
U-ε⁢η≥0  on ⁢∂⁡𝒜∩{λ>0}
	

On the other side, since ∂λ⁡η=0 on {λ=0}, we deduce that -∂λ(U- εη)≥0 on ∂⁡𝒜∩{λ=0}. Thus, using Lemma 4.3, we conclude that the minimum of U-ε⁢η cannot be achieved on (ℬ+⁢(z0,R)\ℬ+(z0,R)/2)¯)∩{λ=0}. This reaches the claim. Finally, since (U-ε⁢η)⁢((P,0))=0, we deduce that ∂ν⁡(U-ε⁢η)⁡((P,0))≤ 0 , which in turn implies that ∂ν⁡U⁢((P,0))<0 using that ∂ν⁡η⁢((P,0))<0. This concludes the case c1⁢(z)=c2⁢(ξ)≡0.

18 ELEONORA CINTI AND JINGGANG TAN In the general case, we introduce the function v=e-β⁢λ⁢U and we compute

	-ℒ⁢v	=-e-β⁢λ⁢ℒ⁢U+2⁢β⁢e-β⁢λ⁢Uλ-β2⁢v	
		≥c1⁢(z)-β2⁢v+2⁢β⁢e-β⁢λ⁢(β⁢eβ⁢λ⁢v+eβ⁢λ⁢vλ)	
		=c1⁢(z)+β2⁢v+2⁢β⁢vλ	

Therefore, we have

	
-ℒ⁢v-2⁢β⁢vλ≥c1⁢(z)+β2⁢v≥0.
	

Moreover, for β large enough

	
-∂λ⁡v≥(β+c2⁢(z))⁢v≥0.
	

We can apply the first part of the proof to the function v, noting that the same argument works when the operator ℒ is replaced by ℒ+2⁢β⁢∂λ. 5. Proof of Theorems 1.3 and 1.4 In this last section we give the proof of our Liouville-type result. We consider a solution U=U⁢(|(x,y)|,t,λ) of

	
{ℒ⁢U=0	 in ⁢ℍ^+n:=ℍn×ℝ+
-∂λ⁡U=Up	 on ⁢ℍn=∂⁡ℍ^+n,
U>0	 in ⁢ℍ+n
	

First of all, we perform the CR inversion of U. For z=(x,y,t,λ)∈ ℍ^n, let

	
w⁢(z)=1ρQ-1⁢U⁢(z~),
	

where z~=1ρ4⁢(x⁢t+y⁢r2,y⁢t-x⁢r2,-t,λ⁢ρ2),r=(∑j=1n(xj2+yj2)+λ2)12 and ρ⁢(z)=(r4+t2)14=dℍ^⁢(z,0). We have seen in Lemma 3.1 that w satisfies

	
{ℒ⁢w=0	 in ⁢ℍ^+n\{0}
-∂λ⁡w=ρp⁢(Q-1)-(Q+1)⁢wp	 on ⁢ℍn×{λ=0}\{0}
	

Observe that the function w could be singular at the origin and it satisfies limρ→∞⁡ρQ-1⁢w⁢(z)=U⁢(0), hence

	
0<w⁢(z)≤C~ρ⁢(z)Q-1, for ⁢ρ⁢(z)≥1
	




NONLOCAL LIOUVILLE THEOREM 19 for some positive constant C~. We start now applying the moving plane method. We will move a hyperplane orthogonal to the t-direction and use the H-reflection. More precisely, for any μ≤0, let Tμ={z∈ℍ^+n∣t=μ}, and Σμ={z∈ℍ^+n∣t<μ}. For z∈Σμ, we define zμ=(y,x,2⁢μ-t,λ). To avoid the singular point, we consider

	
Σ~μ=Σμ\{eμ},
	

where eμ=(0,0,2⁢μ,0) is the reflection of the origin. We recall that, as shown in the proof of Lemma 3.1, if U depends only on (r0,t,λ), then so does w. Let now

	wμ⁢(z)	=wμ⁢(|(x,y)|,t,λ):=w⁢(|(x,y)|,2⁢μ-t,λ)	
		=w⁢(y,x,2⁢μ-t,λ)=w⁢(zμ)	

and

	
Wμ⁢(z):=wμ⁢(z)-w⁢(z)=w⁢(zμ)-w⁢(z),z∈Σμ.
	

By using the invariance of the operator under the CR transform as in Lemma 3.1 and the fact that ρ⁢(zμ)≤ρ⁢(z), we deduce that

where c⁢(z,μ)=p⁢Ψμp-1ρ(Q+1)-p⁢(Q-1) and Ψμ⁢(z) is between w⁢(z) and wμ⁢(z). By the definition of wμ and w, we have that c⁢(z,μ)≈C/ρ2 at infinity.","4. MaXimum PRINCIPLES AND Hopf LEMMA Basic tools in the method of moving planes are the maximum principle and Hopf Lemma. For the validity of the maximum principle and Hopf Lemma for the sublaplacian in homogeneous Carnot groups, we refer to [6] (Chapter 5, Appendix A). We start by recalling the classical maximum principle for Hörmander-type operators due to Bony [7]. Proposition 4.1. [7] Let 𝒟 be a bounded domain in ℍ^n, let Z be a smooth vector field on 𝒟 and let a be a smooth nonnegative function. Assume that U∈C2⁢(𝒟)∩C1⁢(𝒟¯) is a solution of

	
{-ℒ⁢U+Z⁢(z)⁢U+a⁢(z)⁢U≥0	 in ⁢𝒟
U≥0	 on ⁢∂⁡𝒟
	

Then U≥0 in 𝒟. We prove now two Hopf Lemmas. The first one is Hopf Lemma for the operator ℒ in a subset 𝒱 of ℍ^n. We remind that the analogue result for the Heisenberg Laplacian Δℍ in ℍn was established in [3]. We start with the following definition. Definition 4.2. Let 𝒟⊂ℍ^n. We say that 𝒟 satisfies the interior dℍ-ball condition at P∈∂⁡𝒟 if there exists a constant R>0 and a point z0∈𝒟, such that the ball ℬ⁢(z0,R)⊂𝒟 and P∈∂⁡ℬ⁢(z0,R), where ℬ⁢(z0,R)={z∈ℍ^n∣dℍ⁢(z,z0)<R}.

A LIOUVILLE THEOREM FOR NONLOCAL EQUATIONS IN THE HEISENBERG GROUP 137 Lemma 4.3. Let 𝒟⊂ℍ^n satisfy the interior dℍ^-ball condition at the point P0∈∂⁡𝒟 and let U∈C2⁢(𝒟)∩C1⁢(𝒟¯), be a solution of

	
-ℒ⁢U≥c1⁢(z)⁢U⁢ in ⁢𝒟
	

with c1∈L∞⁢(𝒟). Suppose that U⁢(z)>U⁢(P0)=0 for every z∈𝒟. Then

	
lims→0⁡U⁢(P0)-U⁢(P0-s⁢ν)s<0.
	

where ν is the outer normal to ∂⁡𝒟 in P0. Remark 4.4. We observe that if the function c1 in Lemma 4.3 is identically zero, then we can drop the assumption U⁢(P0)=0.

Proof. By assumption, there exist a point z0=(x^1,…,x^n,y^1,…,y^n,t^,λ^) and a radius R>0 such that the ball ℬ⁢(z0,R)⊂𝒟 and P0∈∂⁡ℬ⁢(z0,R) We consider the function

	
ψ=U⁢e-K⁢(x1-x^1)2, for ⁢K>0
	

An easy computation yields

	
∂2⁡ψ∂⁡x12=e-K⁢(x1-x^1)2⁢[4⁢K2⁢(x1-x^1)2⁢U-2⁢K⁢U-4⁢K⁢(x1-x^1)⁢∂⁡U∂⁡x1+∂2⁡U∂⁡x12],

where j=2,⋯,n,k=1,⋯,n. Moreover,

and hence for K sufficiently large, we deduce

	
-ℒ⁢ψ-4⁢K⁢(x1-x^1)⁢X1⁢ψ≥0
	

We introduce now the function ϕ=e-α⁢R2-e-α⁢ρ2, where ρ=dℍ^⁢(z,z0), and 0<ρ<R. Since ϕ depends only on the distance from z0, and ℒ and X1 are invariant with respect to the group action in ℍ^n, we can use formula (2.3) where now ρ=dℍ^⁢(z0-1∘z,0), and the factor r2ρ2 is replaced by the function G⁢(z0-1∘z), where

	
G⁢(x1,…,xn,y1,…,yn,t,λ):=∑j=1n(xj2+yj2)+λ2[(∑j=1n(xj2+yj2)+λ2)2+t2]12.
	

Choosing α sufficiently large, we have

	-	ℒ⁢ϕ-4⁢K⁢(x1-x^1)⁢X1⁢ϕ	
	=	[G(z0-1∘z)(4α2ρ2-2(Q+1)α)	
		-8Kα(x1-x^1)ρX1ρ]e-α⁢ρ2≥0,	

Let 𝒜:=ℬ⁢(z0,R)\ℬ⁢(z0,R1) for 0<R1<R. For ε small enough

	
ψ⁢(z)+ε⁢ϕ⁢(z)≥0  in ⁢∂⁡𝒜:=∂⁡ℬ⁢(z0,R)∪∂⁡ℬ⁢(z0,R1)
	

Then, by Proposition 4.1 we obtain that ψ⁢(z)+ε⁢ϕ⁢(z)≥0 in 𝒜. Therefore, using that ψ⁢(P0)=ϕ⁢(P0)=0, we deduce that for s small

	
ψ⁢(P0)-ψ⁢(P0-s⁢ν)+ε⁢(ϕ⁢(P0)-ϕ⁢(P0-s⁢ν))≤0
	

Using that ϕ is strictly increasing in ρ, we deduce

	
lims→0⁡ψ⁢(P0)-ψ⁢(P0-s⁢ν)s<0,
	

which, using the definition of ψ (4.3), implies that

	
lims→0⁡U⁢(P0-s⁢ν)-U⁢(P0)s<0.
	




A LiOUVILLE THEOREM FOR NONLOCAL EQUATIONS IN THE HEISENBERG GROUP 139 For any Ω⊂ℍn, we denote by 𝒞 the infinite cylinder

	
𝒞=Ω×(0,+∞)
	

Before proving our second Hopf Lemma, let us recall the notion of interior ball condition in the Heisenberg group.

Definition 4.5. Let Ω⊂ℍn. We say that Ω satisfies the interior Heisenberg ball condition at ξ∈∂⁡Ω if there exists a constant R>0 and a point ξ0∈Ω, such that the Heisenberg ball Bℍ⁢(ξ0,R)⊂Ω and ξ∈∂⁡Bℍ⁢(ξ0,R).

Lemma 4.6. Let Ω⊂ℍn satisfy the interior Heisenberg ball condition at the point P∈∂⁡Ω and let U∈C2⁢(𝒞)∩C1⁢(𝒞¯), be a nonnegative solution of

	
{-ℒ⁢U≥c1⁢(z)⁢U	 in ⁢𝒞
-∂λ⁡U≥c2⁢(ξ)⁢U	 on ⁢Ω
	

with c1,c2∈L∞⁢(𝒞) and c1 is nonnegative. Suppose that U⁢((P,0))=0 and U is not identically null. Then

	
∂ν⁡U⁢(P,0)<0
	

where ν is the outer normal to ∂⁡Ω in P. Proof. We follow the proof of Lemma 2.4 in [10]. By the strong maximum principle and by Lemma 4.3, we have that

	
U>0⁢ on ⁢𝒞∪Ω
	

Indeed, the strong maximum principle ensures that U>0 in 𝒞, moreover U cannot vanish at a point in Ω, otherwise at this point the Neumann condition would be violated by Lemma 4.3. We start by proving the lemma in the case c1⁢(z)=c2⁢(ξ)≡0.

140 ELEONORA CINTI Since Ω satisfies the interior Heisenberg ball condition at P, there exist z0∈Ω×{0} and R>0, such that the ball ℬ+⁢(z0,R) is contained in the cylinder 𝒞 and (∂⁡𝒞∩{λ>0}¯)∩ ∂⁡ℬ+⁢(z0,R)={(P,0)}. We consider the set

	
𝒜=(ℬ+⁢(z0,R)\ℬ+⁢(z0,R/2)¯)∩{λ>0}
	

We observe that {(P,0)}=∂⁡𝒜∩∂⁡𝒞∩{λ>0}¯. For z∈𝒜 we consider the function η⁢(z)=e-α⁢ρ2-e-α⁢R2, where ρ=dℍ^⁢(z,z0). Writing ℒ in radial coordinate as in (2.3), we have that

	
ℒ⁢η⁢(ρ)=G⁢(z0-1∘z)⁢(4⁢α2⁢ρ2-2⁢(Q+1)⁢α)⁢e-α⁢ρ2,
	

where G is defined as in (4.4). Therefore, for α sufficiently large, we have that

	
-ℒ⁢η≤0
	

By (4.7) we deduce that U>0 on ∂⁡ℬ+⁢(z0,R/2)∩{λ≥0}. Hence, we may choose ε>0 such that

	
U-ε⁢η≥0  on ⁢∂⁡ℬ+⁢(z0,R/2)∩{λ≥0}
	

Claim: U-ε⁢η≥0 in 𝒜. Indeed, using (4.8), we deduce that -ℒ⁢(U-ε⁢η)≥0 in 𝒜. Hence, by the maximum principle, we have that the minimum of U-ε⁢η is attained only on ∂⁡𝒜 (unless U-ε⁢η is constant). Now, on one side we have that

	
U-ε⁢η≥0⁢ on ⁢∂⁡𝒜∩{λ>0}
	

On the other side, since ∂λ⁡η=0 on {λ=0}, we deduce that -∂λ⁡(U-ε⁢η)≥0 on ∂⁡𝒜∩{λ=0}.

Thus, using Lemma 4.3, we conclude that the minimum of U-ε⁢η cannot be achieved on (ℬ+⁢(z0,R)\ℬ+(z0,R)/2)¯)∩{λ=0}. This reaches the claim. Finally, since (U-ε⁢η)⁢((P,0))=0, we deduce that ∂ν⁡(U-ε⁢η)⁡((P,0))≤0, which in turn implies that ∂ν⁡U⁢((P,0))<0 using that ∂ν⁡η⁢((P,0))<0. This concludes the case c1⁢(z)=c2⁢(ξ)≡0.

A LIOUVILLE THEOREM FOR NONLOCAL EQUATIONS IN THE HEISENBERG GROUP 141 In the general case, we introduce the function v=e-β⁢λ⁢U and we compute

	-ℒ⁢v	=-e-β⁢λ⁢ℒ⁢U+2⁢β⁢e-β⁢λ⁢Uλ-β2⁢v	
		≥c1⁢(z)-β2⁢v+2⁢β⁢e-β⁢λ⁢(β⁢eβ⁢λ⁢v+eβ⁢λ⁢vλ)	
		=c1⁢(z)+β2⁢v+2⁢β⁢vλ.	

Therefore, we have

	
-ℒ⁢v-2⁢β⁢vλ≥c1⁢(z)+β2⁢v≥0.
	

Moreover, for β large enough

	
-∂λ⁡v≥(β+c2⁢(z))⁢v≥0.
	

We can apply the first part of the proof to the function v, noting that the same argument works when the operator ℒ is replaced by ℒ+2⁢β⁢∂λ. 5. PRoOf OF TheOrems 1.3 and 1.4 In this last section we give the proof of our Liouville-type result. We recall that U=U⁢(|(x,y)|,t,λ) is a solution of

	
{ℒ⁢U=0	 in ⁢ℍ^+n:=ℍn×ℝ+
-∂λ⁡U=Up	 on ⁢ℍn=∂⁡ℍ^+n
U>0	 in ⁢ℍ^+n.
	

First of all, we consider the CR inversion of U. For z=(x,y,t,λ)∈ℍ^n, let

	
w⁢(z)=1ρQ-1⁢U⁢(z~),
	

where z~=1ρ4⁢(x⁢t+y⁢r2,y⁢t-x⁢r2,-t,λ⁢ρ2),r=(∑j=1n(xj2+yj2)+λ2)12 and ρ(z)=(r4+ t2)14=dℍ^(z,0). We have seen in Lemma 3.1 that w satisfies

	
{ℒ⁢w=0	 in ⁢ℍ^+n\{0},
-∂λ⁡w=ρp⁢(Q-1)-(Q+1)⁢wp	 on ⁢ℍn.
	




142 ELEONORA CINTI Observe that the function w could be singular at the origin and it satisfies limρ→∞⁡ρQ-1⁢w⁢(z)= U⁢(0)

We start now applying the moving plane method. We will move a hyperplane orthogonal to the t-direction and use the H-reflection. More precisely, for any μ≤0, let Tμ={z∈ℍ^+n∣t=μ}, and Σμ={z∈ℍ^+n∣t<μ}. For z∈Σμ, we define zμ=(y,x,2⁢μ-t,λ). To avoid the singular point, we consider

	
Σ~μ=Σμ\{eμ},
	

where eμ=(0,0,2⁢μ,0) is the reflection of the origin. Let

	
wμ⁢(z)=wμ⁢(|(x,y)|,t,λ):=w⁢(|(x,y)|,2⁢μ-t,λ)=w⁢(y,x,2⁢μ-t,λ)=w⁢(zμ)
	

and

	
Wμ⁢(z):=wμ⁢(z)-w⁢(z)=w⁢(zμ)-w⁢(z),z∈Σμ.
	

By using the invariance of the operator under the CR transform as in Lemma 3.1 and the fact that ρ⁢(zμ)≤ρ⁢(z), we have that

20 ELEONORA CINTI AND JINGGANG TAN Proof. We follow the proof of Proposition 6.3 in [11. We first observe that by the maximum principle and Hopf’s Lemma (see Lemma 4.3)

	
min⁡{w⁢(z):z∈∂⁡ℬ+⁢(0,1)∩{λ>0}}=d>0.
	

We define for z∈𝒜ε:=ℬ+⁢(0,1)¯\ℬ+⁢(0,ε) the function

	
ϕε⁢(z)=d⁢ρ⁢(z)1-Q-ε1-Q1-εQ-1.
	

By Lemma 2.1 ϕε is harmonic in 𝒜ε and satisfies ∂⁡ϕε∂⁡λ=0 on 𝒜ε∩{λ= 0}.

By the maximum principle and Hopf’s Lemma we have that w⁢(z)≥ ϕε⁢(z) for z∈𝒜ε. Since for every z we have limε→0⁡ϕε⁢(z)=d⁢ρ⁢(z)1-Q≥ d, we deduce that

	
w⁢(z)≥d  on ⁢ℬ+⁢(0,1)¯\{0}
	

Since w⁢(z)→0 as ρ⁢(z)→∞, it follows that for μ large in absolute value, we have w≤d in ℬ+⁢(zμ,1). For such μ we have clearly Wμ≥0 on ℬ+⁢(zμ,1), and therefore

	
W~μ≥0  on ⁢ℬ+⁢(zμ,1).
	

It follows that, for μ<0 large in absolute value,

	
infΣμ⁡W~μ<0  implies  infΣμ⁡W~μ=infΣμ\ℬ+⁢(zμ,1)⁡W~μ⁢. 
	

We conclude the proof of i) observing that W~μ⁢(z)→0 as ρ⁢(z)→∞. To prove (ii), suppose that z0 is a minimum point of W~μ such that W~μ⁢(z0)<0. We want to show that ρ⁢(z0) cannot be too large. By the definition of W~μ, a direct calculation gives

	
{-ℒ⁢W~μ=ℒ⁢(h0)h0⁢W~μ+2⁢(∇ℍ⁡h0h0⋅∇ℍ⁡W~μ+∂λ⁡h0h0⁢∂λ⁡W~μ+4⁢λ2⁢∂t⁡h0h0⁢∂t⁡W~μ)  in ⁢Σμ\{eμ},
-∂λ⁡W~μ≥(c⁢(z,μ)+∂λ⁡h0h0)⁢W~μ  on ⁢∂⁡Σμ∩{λ=0}\{zμ},
	

where c⁢(z,μ)=p⁢ρp⁢(Q-1)-(Q+1)⁢Ψμp-1 and Ψμ⁢(z) is between wμ⁢(z) and w⁢(z). Since ℒ⁢(h0)h0=β1⁢(β1-(Q-1))⁢ρ⁢(z+β2⁢e2⁢n+2)-2<0, using the maximum principle we deduce that z0 does not belong to the interior of Σμ.

Assume now that z0∈∂⁡Σμ∩{λ=0}\{zμ}. As above we conclude that Ψμ⁢(z0)≤w⁢(z0)≤C~ρ⁢(z0)q-1, and hence that c⁢(z0,μ)≤p⁢C~p-1ρ⁢(z0)2. Since ∂λ⁡h0h0=-β1⁢β2⁢ρ⁢(z+β2⁢e2⁢n+2)-2, using assumptions (5.4), we would deduce that ∂λ⁡W~μ⁢(z0)<0 if ρ⁢(z0) were large enough. This is inconsistent with the fact z0 is a minimum and concludes the proof of ii).

NONLOCAL LIOUVILLE THEOREM 21 Proof of Theorem 1.4. By Proposition 5.1, we deduce that for μ negative and large in absolute value we have that W~μ≥0 and hence Wμ≥0 in Σμ. Let us define μ0=sup{μ<0∣Wσ≥0 on Σσ\eσ for all σ<μ}. We only need to prove that μ0=0. Suppose that μ0≠0 by contradiction. By continuity, Wμ0≥0 in Σμ0. By the maximum principle (and Hopf’s Lemma), we deduce that Wμ0≡0 in Σμ0 or

	
Wμ0>0  on  Σμ0∪(∂⁡Σμ0∩{λ=0}∩{t<μ0})\{eμ0}.
	

If Wμ0≡0, then w would be even in the t variable with respect to t=μ0<0 and this would contradict the Neumann condition satisfied by w (we remind that ρ⁢(zμ0)<ρ⁢(z) since we are assuming μ0<0 ), hence Wμ0≡0 is impossible and therefore (5.6) holds.

By the definition of μ0 there exists μk→μ0,μ0<μk<0 such that infΣμk⁡Wμk<0. We observe that for some positive b1 :

	
min⁡{Wμ0⁢(z)∣z∈∂⁡ℬ+⁢(eμ0,|μ0|/2)∩ℍ^+n}=b1.
	

From this fact, using a similar argument to the one of point i) in Proposition 5.1, we deduce that

	
Wμ0≥b1  in ⁢ℬ+⁢(eμ0,|μ0|/2)¯\{eμ0}.
	

Therefore, we have that

	
limk→∞⁡inf⁡{Wμk⁢(z)∣z∈ℬ+⁢(eμk,|μ0|/2)\{eμk}}≥b1.
	

Using this bound and the fact that Wμk⁢(z)→0 as ρ⁢(z)→∞, we deduce that for k large enough, the negative infimum of Wμk is attained at some point zk∈Σμk¯\ℬ+⁢(eμk,|μ0|/2).

By Proposition 5.1 we know that the sequence {zk} is bounded and therefore, after passing to a subsequence, we may assume that zk→z0. By (5.6) we have that Wμ0⁢(z0)=0 and z0∈∂⁡Σμ0∩{t=μ0}.

If zk∈Σμk∩{λ>0} for an infinite number of k, then ∇⁡Wμk⁢(zk)=0, and therefore, by continuity

	
∇⁡Wμ0⁢(z0)=0.
	

If z0∈∂⁡Σμ0∩ℍ^+n, then by Lemma 4.3, we have that ∂⁡w∂⁡t⁢(z0)<0, which gives a contradiction. Analogously, using Lemma 4.6, we get a contradiction if we assume that z0∈∂⁡Σμ0∩{λ=0}∩{t=μ0}.

In the case in which zk∈∂⁡Σμk∩{λ=0}∩{t<μk}, we still have that the derivatives of Wμk at zk in all directions except the λ direction vanish. Passing to the limit and arguing as above, we get a contradiction. Hence we have established that μ0=0. This implies that v is even in t, but since the origin 0 on the t-axes is arbitrary, we

22 ELEONORA CINTI AND JINGGANG TAN can perform the CR transform with respect to any point and then we conclude that w is constant in the direction t.

This shows that U is actually a solution of the following problem

	
{Δ⁢U=0	 in ⁢ℝ+2⁢n+1
-∂λ⁡U=Up	 on ⁢ℝ2⁢n
	

Since Q+1Q-1=2⁢n+32⁢n+1<2⁢n+12⁢n-1, we conclude the proof by using the standard Liouville type theorem for problem (5.8) (see [11, 24]).

The following lemma allows us to deduce Theorem 1.3 by Theorem 1.4.

Lemma 5.2. Let u∈C2⁢(ℍn) be cylindrically symmetric and positive (respectively nonnegative). Then the corresponding solution U of the extension problem (1.7) is cylindrically simmetric, i.e. U=U⁢(r0,t,λ) with r0=x2+y2,U is positive (respectively nonnegative) and moreover U∈C2⁢(ℍ^+n)∩C1⁢(ℍ^+n).

Proof. The main tool in the proof of the Lemma relies on the construction of the extension U=ℰ1/2⁢u by using the Fourier transform in ℍn (we refer for details to Section 5 in [16] and to [2]). Let us recall the Fourier transform of a smooth function u⁢(ζ,t),(ζ,t)∈ℍn,

	
ℱ⁢(u)⁢(μ)=∫ℍnu⁢(ζ,t)⁢πζ,tμ⁢𝑑ζ⁢𝑑t,
	

where πζ,tμ denotes the irreducible representation

	
πζ,tμ⁢Ψ⁢(ξ)={Ψ⁢(ξ-ζ¯)⁢ei⁢μ⁢t+2⁢μ⁢(ξ⋅ζ-|ζ|2/2),	μ>0
Ψ⁢(ξ+ζ)⁢ei⁢μ⁢t+2⁢μ⁢(ξ⋅ζ¯-|ζ|2/2),	μ<0
	

for a holomorphic function Ψ⁢(ξ),ξ∈ℍn in the Bargmann space with orthogonal basis

	
Ψα,μ⁢(ξ)=(2⁢|μ|⁢ξ)αα!
	

The inversion formula is given by

	
u⁢(ζ,t)=2n-1πn+1⁢∫ℝtr⁡πζ,t*,μ⁢ℱ⁢(u)⁢(μ)⁢|μ|n⁢𝑑μ
	

where πζ,t*,μ=π(ζ,t)-1μ is the adjoint operator of πζ,tμ. The extension operator ℰ1/2 maps a function u on the Heisenberg group to a function U=ℰ1/2⁢u on ℍn×(0,∞). For every q>0, every

NONLOCAL LIOUVILLE THEOREM 23 multi-index vector α and μ∈ℝ,U⁢(⋅,q)=ℰ1/2⁢u⁢(⋅,q) is implicitly given through the Fourier multiplier

	
ℰ1/2u(⋅^⋅q)α⁢(μ)=U^α⁢(μ,q)=ϕα⁢(2⁢|μ|⁢q)⁢u^α⁢(μ),
	

where u^α⁢(μ)=ℱ⁢(u)⁢(μ)⁢Ψα,μ,

	
ϕα⁢(y)=Γ⁢(32+n+2⁢|α|2)Γ⁢(γ)⁢e-y/2⁢y12⁢V⁢(32+n+2⁢|α|2,32,y),
	

and V⁢(a,b,y) is the solution of Kummer’s equation

	
V⁢(a,b,y)=1Γ⁢(a)⁢∫0∞e-τ⁢y⁢τa-1⁢(1+τ)b-a-1⁢𝑑τ.
	

Note that the function q↦ℰ1/2⁢u⁢(⋅,q)^α⁢(μ) solves the equation

	
(q∂q⁢q+12∂q-μ2q-|μ|(n+2|α|))ℰ1/2u(⋅,q^)α(μ)=0
	

and therefore U=ℰ1/2⁢u satisfies

	
(q⁢∂q⁢q+12⁢∂q+q⁢∂t⁢t+12⁢Δb)⁢U=0.
	

We observe that the change of variable q=λ22 transforms equation (5.12) above into the extension (1.2). For every multi-index vector α and μ∈ℝ, we have

	Uα	(ζ~,t~,q)=2n-1πn+1⁢∫ℝ[tr⁡πζ~,t~*,μ⁢ϕα⁢(2⁢|μ|⁢q)⁢u^α⁢(μ)⁢|μ|n]⁢𝑑μ	
	=	2n-1πn+1⁢∫ℝ[tr⁡πζ~,t~*μ⁢ϕα⁢(2⁢|μ|⁢q)⁢(∫ℍnu⁢(ζ,t)⁢πζ,tμ⁢𝑑ζ⁢𝑑t⁢Ψα,μ)⁢|μ|n]⁢𝑑μ	
	=	2n-1πn+1⁢∫ℝ∫ℍn[tr⁡ϕα⁢(2⁢|μ|⁢q)⁢(u⁢(ζ,t)⁢π(ζ~,t~)-1μ⁢πζ,tμ⁢Ψα,μ)⁢|μ|n]⁢𝑑ζ⁢𝑑t⁢𝑑μ.	

We observe that if u is cylindrically symmetric with respect to ζ, that is, for the rotation ℛx,y,

	
u⁢(ζ,t)=u⁢(ℛx,y⁢(ζ),t),
	

then the extension Uα⁢(ζ,t,q) of ℰ1/2⁢u⁢(⋅,q)^ is cylindrically symmetric with respect to ζ=(x,y) for each q. That is,

	
U⁢(ζ,t,q)=U⁢(ℛx,y⁢(ζ),t,q).
	

After the change of variables q=λ2/2, we deduce that U⁢(ζ,t,λ) is cylindrically symmetric with respect to ζ=(x,y) for each λ.

By Lemma [5.2, we see that if u is a cylindrical function, that is u=u⁢(|(x,y)|,t), then its extension U satisfying (1.2) is also cylindrical in the all halfspace ℍn×ℝ+, in the sense that U= U⁢(|(x,y)|,t,λ). Using this fact, the conclusion follows as a corollary of Theorem 1.4.","The following proposition contains the first crucial step in the method of moving planes. Proposition 5.1. Assume that w∈C2⁢(ℍ^+n)∩C1⁢(ℍ+n¯)\{0} satisfies (5.2). Then (i) For μ<0 with |μ| large enough, if infΣμ⁡Wμ<0, then the infimum is attained at some point z0∈Σμ¯\{eμ}. (ii) There exists an R1>0 such that whenever infΣμ⁡Wμ is attained at z0∈Σμ¯\{eμ} with Wμ⁢(z0)<0, then ρ⁢(z0)=dℕ^⁢(z0,0)≤R1.

The proof is based on the construction of a comparison function and on the use of maximum principles and Hopf Lemmas. For the details we refer to [11]. We can prove now our main result Theorem 1.4.

A LiOUVILLE THEOREM FOR NONLOCAL EQUATIONS IN THE HEISENBERG GROUP 143 Proof of Theorem 1.4. By Proposition 5.1, we deduce that for μ negative and large in absolute value we have that Wμ≥0 in Σμ. Let us define μ0=sup{μ<0∣Wσ≥ 0 on Σσ\eσ for all σ<μ}. We only need to prove that μ0=0. Suppose that μ0≠0 by contradiction. By continuity, Wμ0≥0 in Σμ0. By the maximum principle, we deduce that Wμ0≡0 in Σμ0 or

	
Wμ0>0  on  Σμ0∪(∂⁡Σμ0∩{λ=0}∩{t<μ0})\{eμ0}.
	

Using the Neumann condition satisfied by Wμ0 and the assumption μ0>0, we see that Wμ0≡0 is impossible. Therefore (5.3) holds. By the definition of μ0 there exists μk→μ0,μ0<μk<0 such that infΣμk⁡Wμk<0. We observe that for some positive b1 :

	
min⁡{Wμ0⁢(z)∣z∈∂⁡ℬ+⁢(eμ0,|μ0|/2)∩ℍ^+n}=b1.
	

From this fact, using a similar argument to the one of point i) in Proposition 5.1, we deduce that

	
Wμ0≥b1  in ⁢ℬ+⁢(eμ0,|μ0|/2)¯\{eμ0}
	

Therefore, we have that

	
limk→∞⁡inf⁡{Wμk⁢(z)∣z∈ℬ+⁢(eμk,|μ0|/2)\{eμk}}≥b1
	

Using this bound and the fact that Wμk⁢(z)→0 as ρ⁢(z)→∞, we deduce that for k large enough, the negative infimum of Wμk is attained at some point zk∈Σμk¯\ℬ+⁢(eμk,|μ0|/2). By Proposition 5.1 we know that the sequence {zk} is bounded and therefore, after passing to a subsequence, we may assume that zk→z0. By (5.3) we have that Wμ0⁢(z0)=0 and z0∈∂⁡Σμ0∩{t=μ0}.

If zk∈Σμk for an infinite number of k, then ∇⁡Wμk⁢(zk)=0, and therefore, by continuity

	
∇⁡Wμ0⁢(z0)=0
	

If z0∈∂⁡Σμ0∩ℍ^+n, then by Lemma 4.3, we have that ∂⁡w∂⁡t⁢(z0)<0, which gives a contradiction. Analogously, using Lemma 4.6, we get a contradiction if we assume that z0∈∂⁡Σμ0∩{λ=0}∩{t=μ0}

144 ELEONORA CINTI In the case in which zk∈∂⁡Σμk∩{λ=0}∩{t<μk}, we still have that the derivatives of Wμk at zk in all directions except the λ direction vanish. Passing to the limit and arguing as above, we get a contradiction. Hence we have established that μ0=0. This implies that v is even in t, but since the origin 0 on the t-axes is arbitrary, we can perform the CR transform with respect to any point and then we conclude that w is constant in the direction t. This shows that U is actually a solution of the following problem

	
{Δ⁢U=0	 in ⁢ℝ+2⁢n+1
-∂λ⁡U=Up	 on ⁢ℝ2⁢n
	

Since Q+1Q-1=2⁢n+32⁢n+1<2⁢n+12⁢n-1, we conclude the proof by using the standard Liouville type theorem for problem (5.5) (see [10,22]). The following lemma allows us to deduce Theorem 1.3 by Theorem 1.4. Lemma 5.2. Let u∈C2⁢(ℍn) be cylindrically symmetric and positive (respectively nonnegative). Then the corresponding solution U of the extension problem (1.7) is cylindrically simmetric, i.e. U=U⁢(r0,t,λ) with r0=x2+y2,U is positive (respectively nonnegative) and moreover U∈C2⁢(ℍ^+n)∩C1⁢(ℍ^+n).

The proof is technical and it uses the Fourier transform in the Heisenberg group. We refer to [11] and [14] for details. We conclude with the proof of Theorem 1.3. Proof of Theorem 1.3. By Lemma 5.2, we see that if u is a cylindrical function, that is u=u⁢(|(x,y)|,t), then its extension U satisfying (1.2) is also cylindrical in the all halfspace ℍn×ℝ+, in the sense that U=U⁢(|(x,y)|,t,λ). Using this fact, the conclusion follows as a corollary of Theorem 1.4.",1332.35374.tex,1330.35490.tex,Paraphrase; Deletions
"The notions of transitivity and full transitivity for abelian p groups were introduced by Kaplansky in the 1950s. Important classes of transitive and fully transitive p-groups were discovered by Hill, among others. Since a 1976 paper by Corner, it has been known that the two properties are independent of one another. We examine how the formation of direct sums of p-groups affects transitivity and full transitivity. In so doing, we uncover a far-reaching class of p-groups for which transitivity and full transitivity are equivalent. This result sheds light on the relationship between the two properties for all p-groups.",Mehdi and Naji introduced the notion of transitivity for QTAG-modules. Motivated by the transitivity and full transitivity we study full transitive pairs of QTAG-modules and obtain several characterizations. Here we examine how the formation of direct sums of QTAG-modules affects tran- sitivity and full transitivity. We extend this concept by defining Ulm supports of QTAG-modules and consequently derive more results about the interrelationships of the various transitivities. 1,0909.20034.tex,1315.16012.tex,Variation of subject; Deletions; Paraphrase

"Definition 1. If G1 and G2 are groups, then {G1,G2} is a fully transitive pair if for every x∈Gi,y∈Gj⁢(i,j∈{1,2}) which satisfy UGi⁢(x)≤UGj⁢(y), there exists α∈Hom⁡(Gi,Gj) with x⁢α=y.

For example, it is an easy exercise to verify that {G1,G2} is a fully transitive pair whenever G1 and G2 are direct summands of a fully transitive group. The next result shows that all fully transitive pairs of p-groups arise in this way.

Proposition 1. Let {Gi}i∈I be a collection of p-groups such that for each i,j∈ I,{Gi,Gj} is a fully transitive pair. Then the (external) direct sum ⨁i∈IGi is fully transitive.

Proof. It suffices to consider the case where I={1,…,n} is finite. Denote G= G1⊕⋯⊕Gn and suppose x,y∈G satisfy UG⁢(x)≤UG⁢(y). We will obtain an endomorphism of G mapping x to y by inducting on the order of y. First suppose p⁢y=0. Write x=(x1,…,xn) and y=(y1,…,yn). By relabelling, we may assume that the p-heights satisfy h⁢tG⁢(x)=h⁢tG1⁢(x1). Observe, since p⁢y=0, that UG1⁢(x1)≤UG⁢(y)≤UGi⁢(yi) for all i. By assumption, there exist αi∈Hom⁡(G1,Gi) with x1⁢αi=yi for 1≤i≤n. Clearly, the n×n matrix with first row (α1,…,αn) and other rows zero represents an endomorphism of G mapping x to y.

Now assume o⁢(y)>p. Note UG⁢(p⁢x)≤UG⁢(p⁢y). Since o⁢(p⁢y)<o⁢(y), induction yields θ∈End⁡(G) with (p⁢x)⁢θ=p⁢y. Set x′=x⁢θ. Then y-x′∈G⁢[p] and UG⁢(x)≤UG⁢(y-x′); hence by the first paragraph there exists α∈End⁡(G) with x⁢α=y-x′. Now θ+α maps x to x′+y-x′=y, as desired.

We will require the following consequence of Proposition 1, indicating how a single fully transitive p-group can be used to produce many more.

Corollary 1. Let G be a fully transitive p-group and λ any cardinal. Then all direct summands of the power ⨁λG are fully transitive.

Proof. Because G is fully transitive, {G,G} is a fully transitive pair. Proposition 1 implies ⨁λG is fully transitive, and the claim follows since direct summands of fully transitive groups are fully transitive.

In [Co, Proposition 2.2], Corner proves that if G=G1⊕G2 is a fully transitive p-group such that the Ulm subgroups pω⁢G1,pω⁢G2 are nontrivial and pω⁢G is homocyclic, then G is transitive. His example of a non-transitive, fully transitive p-group G is such that pω+1⁢G=0, and he notes the ”curious consequence” of Proposition 2.2 that G⊕G must be transitive (note that it is fully transitive by Corollary 1 License or copyright restrictions may apply to redistribution; see https://www.ams.org/journal-terms-of-use

TRANSITIVE AND FULLY TRANSITIVE GROUPS 1607 above). It was Corner’s result that motivated the theorem we shall soon prove. We need two preparatory lemmas.

Lemma 1. Assume G=G1⊕G2 is a fully transitive group and xi,yi∈Gi(i= 1,2). If UG1⁢(x1)≤UG2⁢(y2-x2) and UG2⁢(y2)≤UG1⁢(y1-x1), then there is an automorphism of G mapping (x1,x2) to (y1,y2).

Proof. Because {G1,G2} is a fully transitive pair, there exist α∈Hom⁡(G1,G2) and β∈Hom⁡(G2,G1) with x1⁢α=y2-x2 and y2⁢β=y1-x1. The matrix ϕ= (1+α⁢β	α
β	1) represents an automorphism of G1⊕G2, and an easy check verifies that (x1,x2)⁢ϕ=(y1,y2).

If G is a group and σ an ordinal number, we use fG⁢(σ) to denote the classical Ulm invariant of G at σ (see [Fu] or [Ka]).

Definition 2. If G is a reduced group, the Ulm support supp⁡(G) of G is the set of all ordinal numbers σ less than the p-length of G for which fG⁢(σ) is nonzero. If G1 and G2 are p-groups with supp⁡(G1)⊆supp⁡(G2), it follows that every U sequence relative to G1 is also a U-sequence relative to G2. In particular, we note that for every x∈G1 there is an element y∈G2 such that UG1⁢(x)=UG2⁢(y) (see [Ka, Lemma 24]). We employ this fact in the proof of the following crucial lemma. Lemma 2. Assume G=G1⊕G2 is a fully transitive p-group and supp (pω⁢G1)⊆ supp⁡(pω⁢G2). If x∈pω⁢G, there is an automorphism of G mapping x to an element (c,d)∈G1⊕G2 with UG⁢(x)=UG2⁢(d).

Proof. Write x=(a,b) and assume for the moment that we have shown that there exists an automorphism ϕ of G with x⁢ϕ=(a1,b1) and h⁢tG1⁢(pi⁢a1)≠h⁢tG2⁢(pi⁢b1) whenever pi⁢a1≠0. But then, as noted above, our assumption on the Ulm supports means we can choose b2∈pω⁢G2 such that UG1⁢(a1)=UG2⁢(b2). By full transitivity, b2=a1⁢α for some homomorphism α:G1→G2. The composite automorphism ϕ⁢(1	α
0	1) of G1⊕G2 maps x to (a1,b1+b2). Since h⁢t⁢(pi⁢b1)≠h⁢t⁢(pi⁢b2) when pi⁢b1≠0, we compute

	
UG2⁢(b1+b2)=UG2⁢(b1)∧UG2⁢(b2)=UG2⁢(b1)∧UG1⁢(a1)=UG⁢(x).
	

Choosing d=(b1+b2) gives the desired result. It remains only to establish the existence of the elements a1,b1 and the automorphism ϕ as above. We prove this by induction on the maximum m of the set

	
𝒮G⁢(a,b)={i<ω:h⁢tG1⁢(pi⁢a)=h⁢tG2⁢(pi⁢b)≠∞}.
	

If 𝒮=∅, simply take ϕ=1G. If m=0, we proceed as follows. Clearly h⁢t⁢(p⁢a)> h⁢t⁢(p⁢b) or h⁢t⁢(p⁢a)<h⁢t⁢(p⁢b) by definition of 𝒮G⁢(a,b), say the former. Then h⁢tG1⁢(p⁢a)> h⁢tG1⁢(a)+1; hence p⁢a=p⁢a1 for some a1∈G1 with h⁢t⁢(a1)>h⁢t⁢(a). Put b1=b. Clearly, h⁢t⁢(pi⁢a1)=h⁢t⁢(pi⁢b1) only if pi⁢a1=0. Since UG1⁢(a1-a)=(h⁢t⁢(a),∞,…)≥ UG2⁢(b1) and {G1,G2} is a fully transitive pair, we have a1-a=b1⁢α for some α∈ Hom⁡(G2,G1). The automorphism (1	0
α	1) of G1⊕G2 maps (a,b) to (a1,b1) as desired. If h⁢t⁢(p⁢a)<h⁢t⁢(p⁢b), we proceed as above to obtain a suitable automorphism of the form (1	α
0	1), finishing the case m=0. License or copyright restrictions may apply to redistribution; see https://www.ams.org/journal-terms-of-use

1608 STEVE FILES AND BRENDAN GOLDSMITH Now assume that 𝒮G⁢(a,b) is nonempty and has maximum m>0. Note that 𝒮G⁢(p⁢a,p⁢b) has maximum <m. By induction, there exists ψ∈Aut⁡(G) such that (p⁢a,p⁢b)⁢ψ=(a2,b2) and h⁢t⁢(pi⁢a2)≠h⁢t⁢(pi⁢b2) whenever pi⁢a2≠0. Set x′=(a′,b′)= x⁢ψ. Because p⁢x′=(a2,b2), it follows that 𝒮G⁢(a′,b′) is empty or has maximum 0 . By the above paragraph, there exists ϕ∈Aut⁡(G) such that (a′,b′)⁢ϕ=x⁢ψ⁢ϕ=(a1,b1) and h⁢t⁢(pi⁢a1)≠h⁢t⁢(pi⁢b1) whenever pi⁢a1≠0. This establishes our claim.

Before turning to the main theorem, we observe a consequence of Lemmas 1 and 2 which indicates that a fully transitive p-group G with transitive direct summand H is itself transitive provided pω⁢G and pω⁢H have the same Ulm supports.

Proposition 2. Assume G=G1⊕G2 is a fully transitive p-group and supp (pω⁢G1) ⊆supp⁡(pω⁢G2). If G2 is transitive, then G is transitive.

Proof. By [Co, Lemma 2.1], we need only verify that Aut⁡(G) acts transitively on pω⁢G. Suppose x,y∈pω⁢G have the same Ulm sequences in G. By Lemma 2 there exist ϕ1,ϕ2∈Aut⁡(G) such that if x⁢ϕ1=(x1,x2) and y⁢ϕ2=(y1,y2), then UG2⁢(x2)=UG⁢(x)=UG⁢(y)=UG2⁢(y2). Note that UG2⁢(x2)≤UG1⁢(y1-x1), since UG⁢(x1-y1,x2-y2)≥UG⁢(x⁢ϕ1). Since G2 is transitive and G is fully transitive, there are β∈Aut⁡(G2) and α∈Hom⁡(G2,G1) with x2⁢β=y2 and x2⁢α=y1-x1. Put ψ=(1	0
α	β), an automorphism of G. An easy check verifies that x⁢ϕ1⁢ψ⁢ϕ2-1=y, as required. The following result is complementary to Corollary 1. Corollary 2. Assume the p-group G is transitive and fully transitive. If {Hi} is a collection of direct summands of any power of G, then the external direct sum G⊕(⊕Hi) is transitive and fully transitive.

Proof. Proposition 1 implies G⊕(⨁Hi) is fully transitive. Since supp⁡(pω⁢G) contains supp⁡(pω⁢Hi), the direct sum is also transitive by Proposition 2.

We now give a result indicating when transitivity and full transitivity are equivalent.","Definition 2.1. Let M1 and M2 be QTAG-modules. Then {M1,M2} is a fully transitive pair if for every x∈Mi,y∈Mj⁢(i,j∈{1,2}) satisfying UMi⁢(x)⩽UMj⁢(y), there exists a homomorphism f form Mi to Mj such that f⁢(x)=y.

Remark 2.1. {M1,M2} is a fully transitive pair whenever M1 and M2 are direct summands of a fully transitive module. Now we are able to prove the following: Proposition 2.1. Let {Mi}i∈I be a collection of Q⁢T⁢A⁢G-modules such that for each i,j∈I,{Mi,Mj} is a fully transitive pair. Then the direct sum ⨁i∈IMi is fully transitive.

Proof. For the finite set I={1,…,n}, put M=M1⊕…⊕Mn and suppose x,y∈M such that UM⁢(x)⩽UM⁢(y). We have to define an endomorphism f of M such that f⁢(x)=y. To apply induction on the exponent, consider y such that d⁢(y⁢R)=1. Now we may assume that x=(x1,…,xn) and y=(y1,…,yn) such that HM⁢(x)=HM1⁢(x1). Since e⁢(y)=1,UM1⁢(x1)⩽UM⁢(y)⩽UMi⁢(yi) for all i. By assumption, there exist homomorphisms fi ’s from M1 to Mi such that fi⁢(x1)=yi, 1⩽i⩽n. Now, the n×n matrix with first row (f1,…,fn) and other rows zero represents an endomorphism f of M mapping x to y.

ON ULM SUPPORT IN Q⁢T⁢A⁢G-MODULES 11 Now assume e⁢(y)>1, then x′,y′∈M such that UM⁢(x′)⩽UM⁢(y′), where d⁢(x⁢Rx′⁢R)=d⁢(y⁢Ry′⁢R)=1. Since e⁢(y′)<e⁢(y), there is an endomorphism ϕ of M such that ϕ⁢(x′)=y′. Then y-ϕ⁢(x)∈Soc⁡(M) and UM⁢(x)⩽UM⁢(y-ϕ⁢(x)); hence there exists an endomorphism ψ of M such that ψ⁢(x)=y-ϕ⁢(x). Now ϕ+ψ maps x to y, and it is the required endomorphism. The following corollary is an immediate consequence of the above proposition: Corollary 2.1. Let M be a fully transitive QTAG-module and β any ordinal. Then all direct summands of ⨁βM are fully transitive.

Proof. Since M is fully transitive, {M,M} is a fully transitive pair. By Proposition 2.1, ⨁βM is fully transitive, for any ordinal β. Since the direct summands of fully transitive modules are fully transitive, we are done.

LEMMA 2.1. Let M=M1⊕M2 be a fully transitive Q⁢T⁢A⁢G-module and xi,yi∈ Mi⁢(i={1,2}). If UM1⁢(x1)⩽UM2⁢(y2-x2) and UM2⁢(y2)⩽UM1⁢(y1-x1), then there is an automorphism of M mapping (x1,x2) to (y1,y2).

Proof. Since {M1,M2} is a fully transitive pair, there exist homomorphisms f1 from M1 to M2 and f2 from M2 to M1 such that f1⁢(x1)=y2-x2 and f2⁢(y2)=y1-x1. The matrix (1+f2⁢f1	f1
f2	1) represents an automorphism ϕ of M1⊕M2 such that ϕ⁢(x1,x2)=(y1,y2)

For a Q⁢T⁢A⁢G-module M and an ordinal σ,fM⁢(σ) denote σt⁢h-U⁢l⁢m invariant of M, defined by Mehdi et.al [5].

DEFinition 2.2. If M is a h-reduced Q⁢T⁢A⁢G-module of length ρ, the Ulm support, denoted by supp⁡(M), of M is the set of all ordinals σ<ρ for which fM⁢(σ) is non-zero. REMARK 2.2. If M1 and M2 are Q⁢T⁢A⁢G-modules with supp (M1)⊆supp⁡(M2), then every U-sequence relative to M1 is also a U-sequence relative to M2. In particular, for every x∈M1, there is an element y∈M2 such that UM1⁢(x)⩽UM2⁢(y). LEMMA 2.2. Let M=M1⊕M2 be a fully transitive Q⁢T⁢A⁢G-module and supp⁡(Hω⁢(M1))⊆supp⁡(Hω⁢(M2)). If x∈Hω⁢(M), there is an automorphism of M mapping x to an element (y,z)∈M1⊕M2 with UM⁢(x)=UM2⁢(z).

Proof. Put x=(a,b), and consider an automorphism ϕ of M such that ϕ⁢(x)= (a1,b1) and HM1⁢(a1′)≠HM2⁢(b1′), whenever a1′⁢R≠0. Here a1′∈M1 and b1′∈M2, such that d⁢(a1⁢Ra1′⁢R)=d⁢(b1⁢Rb1′⁢R)=i. Since supp⁡(Hω⁢(M1))⊆supp⁡(Hω⁢(M2)), we may choose b2∈Hω⁢(M2) such that UM1⁢(a1)=UM2⁢(b2). By full transitivity, there exists a homomorphism f1:M1→M2 such that f1⁢(a1)=b2. Therefore the composite

12 A. HASAN, F. SIKANDER AND F. BEGUM automorphism⁡(1	f1
0	1)⁢ϕ of M1⊕M2 maps x onto (a1,b1+b2). Since H⁢(b1′)≠ H⁢(b2′), where d⁢(b1⁢Rb1′⁢R)=d⁢(b2⁢Rb2′⁢R)=i and b1′⁢R≠0, we compute UM2⁢(b1+b2)= UM2⁢(b1)∧UM2⁢(b2)=UM2⁢(b1)∧UM1⁢(a1)=UM⁢(x). Here UM2⁢(b1)∧UM2⁢(b2)=UM2⁢(b2) if UM2⁢(b2)⩽UM2⁢(b1) and it is UM2⁢(b1) if UM2⁢(b1)<UM2⁢(b2). If we put z=(b1+b2), we get the required result.

Now we have to ensure the existence of the elements a1,b1 and the automorphism ϕ of M. We apply induction on the maximum m of the set 𝒮M⁢(a,b)={i<ω:HM1⁢(a′)=HM2⁢(b′)≠∞}, where a′∈M1 and b′∈M2 such that d⁢(a⁢Ra′⁢R)=d⁢(b⁢Rb′⁢R)=i.

If 𝒮M⁢(a,b) is empty, then ϕ=IM. If the maximum of 𝒮M⁢(a,b) is m=0, then either H⁢(a′)>H⁢(b′) or H⁢(a′)<H⁢(b′), here d⁢(a⁢Ra′⁢R)=d⁢(b⁢Rb′⁢R)=1. Suppose HM1⁢(a′)>HM2⁢(b′). Therefore HM1⁢(a′)>HM1⁢(a)+1, hence a′⁢R=a1′⁢R for some a1∈M and H⁢(a1)>H⁢(a), here d⁢(a1⁢Ra1′⁢R)=1. Put b1=b and we have H⁢(a1′′)=H⁢(b1′′) if a1′′⁢R=0, here d⁢(a1⁢Ra1′′⁢R)=d⁢(b⁢Rb′′⁢R)=i. Since UM1⁢(a1-a)= (H⁢(a),∞,…)⩾UM2⁢(b1) and {M1,M2} is a fully transitive pair, there is a homomorphism f2:M2→M1 such that f2⁢(b1)=a1-a. Therefore the automorphism (1	0
f2	1) of M1⊕M2⁢maps⁡(a,b) to (a1,b1) as required. If H⁢(a′)<H⁢(b′), we obtain a suitable automorphism of the form (1	f1
0	1) and we are done.

Now assume that 𝒮M⁢(a,b) is non-empty and has maximum m>0. If d⁢(a⁢Ra′⁢R)= d⁢(b⁢Rb′⁢R)=1, then 𝒮M⁢(a′,b′) has maximum <m. Inductively there exists an automorphism ψ of M such that ψ⁢(a′,b′)=(a2,b2) and H⁢(a2′)≠H⁢(b2′), here d⁢(a2⁢Ra2′⁢R)= d⁢(b2⁢Rb2′⁢R)=i, whenever a2′⁢R≠0. Again we put x′=(c,d)=ψ⁢(x). Since x′′=(a2,b2), d⁢(x′⁢Rx′′⁢R)=1,𝒮M⁢(c,d) is empty or has maximum 0. By the previous argument there exists an automorphism ϕ of M such that ϕ⁢(c,d)=ϕ⁢ψ⁢(x)=(a1,b1) and H⁢(ai)≠H⁢(bi), whenever ai⁢R≠0. Here d⁢(a1⁢Rai⁢R)=d⁢(b1⁢Rbi⁢R)=i and the result follows.

Proposition 2.2. Let M=M1⊕M2 be a fully transitive Q⁢T⁢A⁢G-module and supp⁡(Hω⁢(M1))⊆supp⁡(Hω⁢(M2)). If M2 is transitive, then M is transitive.

ON ULM SUPPORT IN QTAG-MODULES 13 Proof. Suppose x,y∈Hω⁢(M) have the same U-sequences in M. By Lemma 2.2, there exist automorphisms f1,f2 of M such that f1⁢(x)=(x1,x2) and f2⁢(y)= (y1,y2), therefore UM2⁢(x2)=UM⁢(x)=UM⁢(y)=UM2⁢(y2). Since UM(x1-y1,x2- y2)⩾UM(f1(x)), we have UM2⁢(x2)⩽UM1⁢(y1-x1). As M2 is transitive, there is an automorphism f1′ of M2 such that f1′⁢(x2)=y2 and because M is fully transitive, there is a homomorphism f2′ from M2 to M1 such that f2′⁢(x2)=y1-x1. If we put ψ= (1	0
f2′	f1′), then it is an automorphism of M. Also (f2-1⁢ψ⁢f1)⁢(x)=y, thus (f2-1⁢ψ⁢f1) is the required automorphism and we are done.

Corollary 2.2. If {Ni} is a collection of direct summands of any power of the QTAG-module M, such that M is transitive and fully transitive, then the direct sum M⊕(⊕Ni) is transitive and fully transitive.

Proof. By Proposition 2.1, M⊕(⊕Ni) is fully transitive. Since supp⁡(Hω⁢(Ni)) ⊆supp⁡(Hω⁢(M)), then by Proposition 2.2, the direct sum is also transitive.

We observe that a fully transitive Q⁢T⁢A⁢G-module M with transitive direct summand N is itself transitive provided that Hω⁢(M) and Hω⁢(N) have the same Ulm support. We investigate the conditions under which transitivity and fully transitivity are equivalent.",0909.20034.tex,1315.16012.tex,Insertions; Math-to-Text; Text-to-Math; Paraphrase; Variation of subject; Deletions; Different Presentation

TWO-STEP ITERATION SCHEME FOR NONEXPANSIVE MAPPINGS IN UNIFORMLY CONVEX BANACH SPACE M.R. YADAV, B.S. THAKUR, A.K. SHARMA ABSTRACT. In this paper, we introduced a new type of two-step iterative process to approximate the common fixed points of two nonexpansive mappings in uniformly convex Banach spaces and established weak and strong convergence results for common fixed points of nonexpansive mappings. The results obtained in this paper are generalizations and improvement of recently proved by another author. 1. Introduction : Let K be a nonempty closed convex subset of a uniformly convex Banach space E. Throughout this paper, ℕ denotes the set of all positive integers and F⁢(T)≠ϕ i.e., F⁢(T)={x∈K:T⁢x=x}. A mapping T:K→K is said to be nonexpansive if

	
∥T⁢x-T⁢y∥≤∥x-y∥,
	

for all x,y∈K. We know that a point x∈K is a fixed point of T if T⁢x=x. Several authors have been studied interative techniques for approximation fixed points of nonexpansive mappings (see [9], [10], 2 , 4 and [5]) by using the Mann iteration method (see [11]) or the Ishikawa iteration method (see 8]).

The Picard and Mann [11] iteration schemes for a mapping T:K→K are defined by

	
{x1=x0∈K,
xn+1=T⁢xn
	

and

	
{x1=x0∈K
xn+1=(1-αn)⁢xn+αn⁢T⁢xn,n∈ℕ

86 M.R. YADAV, B.S. THAKUR, A.K. SHARMA Recently, Khan et al. (6], [7) modified the iteration process to the case of two mappings as follows:

	
{x1=x0∈K
xn+1=(1-αn)⁢T⁢xn+αn⁢S⁢yn
yn=(1-βn)⁢xn+βn⁢T⁢xn,n∈ℕ
	

where {αn} and {βn} are sequence in (0,1). In this paper, we have introduced a new implicit iteration scheme given below to compute the common fixed points for a pair of single valued mappings:

	
{x1=x0∈K,
xn+1=(1-αn)⁢T⁢xn+αn⁢S⁢yn,
yn=(1-βn)⁢S⁢xn+βn⁢T⁢xn,n∈ℕ,
	

where {αn} and {βn} are sequences in [0,1]. Observe that in (1.4), if we set S=I,βn=0, then the scheme will reduce to Mann iteration process [11]:

	
{x1=x0∈K,
xn+1=(1-αn)⁢T⁢xn+αn⁢xn,n∈ℕ,
	

where {αn} is a sequence in [0,1]. 2. Preliminaries Let X={x∈E:∥x∥=1} and E* be the dual of E. The space E has : (i) Gâteaux differentiable norm if

	
limt→0⁡∥x+t⁢y∥-∥x∥t,
	

exists for each x,y∈K; (ii) Frèchet differentiable norm (see e.g. [12]) for each x in S, the above limit exists and is attained uniformly for y in S and in this case, it is also well-known that

	
⟨h,J⁢(x)⟩+12⁢∥x∥2≤12⁢∥x+h∥2≤⟨h,J⁢(x)⟩+12⁢∥x∥2+b⁢(∥h∥)
	

for all x,h∈E, where J is the Frèchet derivative of the function 12∥⋅∥2 at x∈E, ⟨.,.⟩isthedualpairingbetweenE and E*, and b is an increasing function defined on [0,∞) such that limt→0⁡b⁢(t)t=0; (iii) Opial’s condition [13] if for any sequence {xn} in E,xn→x implies that

	
lim supn→∞⁡∥xn-x∥<lim supn→∞⁡∥xn-y∥,
	

for all y∈E with y≠x. Following are the definitions and lemma used to prove the results in the next section.

Definition 2.1. A self-mapping T of a subset K of a normed linear space is said to be nonexpansive if

	
∥T⁢x-T⁢y∥≤∥x-y∥
	

holds for all x,y∈K.

TWO-STEP ITERATION SCHEME FOR NONEXPANSIVE MAPPINGS.. 87 Definition 2.2. A self-mapping T of a subset K of a normed linear space is said to be quasi-nonexpansive provided T has at least one fixed point in K, and if p∈K is any fixed point of T, then

	
∥T⁢x-p∥≤∥x-p∥,
	

holds for all x∈K. Definition 2.3. . Let E be a uniformly convex Banach space, K be a nonempty closed convex subset of E, and T:K→K be a nonexpansive mapping. Then I-T is said to be demi-closed at 0 , if xn→x converges weakly and xn-T⁢xn→0 converges strongly, then it is implies that x∈K and T⁢x=x.

Definition 2.4. [1]. Suppose two mappings S,T:K→K, where K is a subset of a normed space E, said to be satisfy condition (A′) if there exists a nondecreasing function F:[0,∞)→[0,∞) with F⁢(0)=0,f⁢(r)>0 for all r∈(0,∞) such that either ∥x-S⁢x∥≥f⁢(d⁢(x,F)) or ∥x-T⁢x∥≥f⁢(d⁢(x,F)) for all x∈K where d(x,F)=inf{∥x-p∥:p∈F=F(S)∩F(T)}.

Lemma 2.5. 3]: Suppose that E be a uniformly convex Banach space and 0< p≤tn≤q<1 for all n∈ℕ. Let {xn} and {yn} be two sequences of E such that lim supn→∞⁡∥xn∥≤r, limsup pn→∞⁢∥yn∥≤r and limn→∞⁡∥(1-tn)⁢xn+tn⁢yn∥=r hold for some r≥0. Then limn→∞⁡∥xn-yn∥=0. 3. Convergente Results : In this section, we have proved the approximate common fixed points of two nonexpansive mapping for weak and strong convergence results, using a new type of iteration process. In the consequence, F denotes the set of common fixed point of the mapping S and T.

Lemma 3.1. : Let K be a nonempty convex subset of a uniformly convex Banach space E. Suppose S,T:K→K be an nonexpansive mappings and {xn} be the sequence as defined by (1.4), with restrictions ∑n=1∞αn<∞, and ∑n=1∞βn<∞. If F⁢(S)∩F⁢(T)≠ϕ, and

	
∥x-S⁢y∥≤∥T⁢x-S⁢y∥, for all ⁢x,y∈K,
	

then

	
limn→∞⁡∥S⁢xn-xn∥=limn→∞⁡∥T⁢xn-xn∥=0,
	

for all p∈F⁢(S)∩F⁢(T). Proof. Suppose p∈F⁢(S)∩F⁢(T) and F⁢(S)∩F⁢(T)≠ϕ. Since S,T are nonexpansive mappings, now using 1.4, we have

	∥yn-p∥	=∥(1-βn)⁢S⁢xn+βn⁢T⁢xn-p∥	
		≤(1-βn)⁢∥S⁢xn-p∥+βn⁢∥T⁢xn-p∥	
		≤(1-βn)⁢∥xn-p∥+βn⁢∥xn-p∥	
		≤∥xn-p∥,	




88 M.R. YADAV, B.S. THAKUR, A.K. SHARMA and,

	∥xn+1-p∥	=∥(1-αn)⁢T⁢xn+αn⁢S⁢yn-p∥	
		≤(1-αn)⁢∥T⁢xn-p∥+αn⁢∥S⁢yn-p∥	
		≤(1-αn)⁢∥xn-p∥+αn⁢∥yn-p∥	
		≤(1-αn)⁢∥xn-p∥+αn⁢∥xn-p∥	
		≤∥xn-p∥.	

Since {∥xn-p∥} is a non-increasing and bounded sequence, so limn→∞⁡∥xn-p∥ exist. Let limn→∞⁡∥xn-p∥=c and suppose that c>0, we get

	c	=limn→∞⁡∥xn+1-p∥	
		=limn→∞⁡∥(1-αn)⁢T⁢xn+αn⁢S⁢yn-p∥	
		=limn→∞⁡(1-αn)⁢∥T⁢xn-p∥+αn⁢∥S⁢yn-p∥.	

Lemma 2.5 gives

	
limn→∞⁡∥T⁢xn-S⁢yn∥=0.
	

Now, from (3.2) and (3.3), we have

	
lim supn→∞⁡∥S⁢yn-p∥≤lim supn→∞⁡∥yn-p∥≤lim supn→∞⁡∥xn-p∥,
	

also

	
lim supn→∞⁡∥T⁢xn-p∥≤lim supn→∞⁡∥xn-p∥=c.
	

It follows from (3.1) and (3.5),

	∥T⁢xn-xn∥	=∥T⁢xn-S⁢yn∥+∥S⁢yn-xn∥	
		≤∥T⁢xn-S⁢yn∥+∥T⁢xn-S⁢yn∥	
		≤2⁢∥T⁢xn-S⁢yn∥	
		→0⁢ as ⁢n→∞.	

Taking limsup on both sides of the above inequality, we obtain

	
limn→∞⁡∥T⁢xn-xn∥=0,
	

and hence

	∥S⁢yn-xn∥	≤∥S⁢yn-T⁢xn∥+∥T⁢xn-xn∥	
		→0⁢ as ⁢n→∞.	

Using 3.8 and 3.9, we have

	∥S⁢xn-xn∥	≤∥S⁢xn-S⁢yn∥+∥S⁢yn-xn∥	
		≤∥yn-xn∥+∥S⁢yn-xn∥	
		≤(1-βn)⁢∥S⁢xn-xn∥+βn⁢∥T⁢xn-xn∥+∥S⁢yn-xn∥	
		≤1βn⁢(βn⁢∥T⁢xn-xn∥+∥S⁢yn-xn∥),	

which implies that

	
limn→∞⁡∥S⁢xn-xn∥=0.
	




TWO-STEP ITERATION SCHEME FOR NONEXPANSIVE MAPPINGS.. 89 This completes the proof. Example 3.1 : Let E be the real line with the usual norm —.— and suppose K=[0,1]. Define S,T:K→K by

	
T⁢x=2-x2⁢ and ⁢S⁢y=4-y5
	

for all x,y∈K. Obviously both S and T are nonexpansive with the common fixed point 23 for all x,y∈K. Now we check that our condition ∥x-S⁢y∥≤∥T⁢x-S⁢x∥ for all x,y∈K is true. If x,y∈[0,1], then

	
|x-S⁢y|=|x-(4-y)5|=|5⁢x+y-45|, and 
|T⁢x-S⁢y|=|2-x2-4-y5|=|2⁢y-5⁢x+210|.
	

Clearly, |5⁢x+y-45|≤|2⁢y-5⁢x+210|, so that |x-S⁢y|≤|T⁢x-S⁢x| for all x,y∈K. Now, we check that S and T are quasi-nonexpansive type mappings. In fact, if x∈[0,1] and p∈[0,1], then

	
|T⁢x-p|=|2-x2-0|=|2-x2|=|2-x2|≤|x|=|x-0|=|x-p|,
	

that is

	
|T⁢x-p|≤|x-p|.
	

Similarly, we prove that

	
|S⁢x-p|≤|x-p|.
	

Therefore, S and T are quasi-nonexpansive type mappings. Lemma 3.2. : Let K be a nonempty closed convex subset of a uniformly convex Banach space E. Suppose {xn} be the sequence defined in Theorem (3.3) with F≠ϕ. Then, for any p1,p2∈F,limn→∞⁡⟨xn,J⁢(p1-p2)⟩ exist, in particular, ⟨p-q,J⁢(p1-p2)⟩=0 for all p,q∈ωω⁢(xn).

Proof. Take x=p1-p2, with p1≠p2 and h=t⁢(xn-p1) in the inequality (2.1) to get:

	12⁢∥p1-p2∥2+t⁢⟨xn-p1,J⁢(p1-p2)⟩	≤12⁢∥t⁢xn+(1-t)⁢p1-p2∥2	
		≤12⁢∥p1-p2∥2+t⁢⟨xn-p1,J⁢(p1-p2)⟩+b⁢(t⁢∥xn-p1∥).	

As supn≥1⁡∥xn-p1∥≤M′ for some M′>0, it follows that

	12⁢∥p1-p2∥2+t	n→∞⁢lim supn→∞⁡⟨xn-p1,J⁢(p1-p2)⟩	
		≤12⁢limn→∞⁡∥t⁢xn+(1-t)⁢p1-p2∥2	
		≤12⁢∥p1-p2∥2+b⁢(t⁢M′)+t⁢lim infn→∞⁡⟨xn-p1,J⁢(p1-p2)⟩.	

That is,

	
lim supn→∞⁡⟨xn-p1,J⁢(p1-p2)⟩≤lim infn→∞⁡⟨xn-p1,J⁢(p1-p2)⟩+b⁢(t⁢M′)t⁢M′⁢M′.
	




90 M.R. YADAV, B.S. THAKUR, A.K. SHARMA If t→0, then limn→∞⁡⟨xn-p1,J⁢(p1-p2)⟩ exists for all p1,p2∈F, in particular, we get

	
⟨p-1,J⁢(p1-p2)⟩=0
	

for all p,q∈ωω⁢(xn). Theorem 3.3. Let E be a uniformly convex Banach space satisfying Opial condition and K,T,S and {xn} be taken as Lemma 3.1. If F⁢(S)∩F⁢(T)≠ϕ,I-T and I-S are demiclosded at zero, then {xn} converges weakly to a common fixed point of S and T.

Proof. Let p∈F⁢(S)∩F⁢(T), then as proved in Lemma 3.1 limn→∞⁡∥xn-p∥ exist. Since E is uniformly convex Banach space. Thus there exists subsequences {xnk}⊂{xn} such that {xnk} converges weakly to z1∈K. From Lemma 3.1 we have

	
limn→∞⁡∥T⁢xnk-xnk∥=0,
	

and

	
limn→∞⁡∥S⁢xnk-xnk∥=0.
	

Since I-T and I-S are demiclosed at zero, therefore S⁢z1=z1. Similarly T⁢z1=z1. Finally, we prove that {xn} converges weakly to z1. Let on contrary that there exists a subsequence {xni}⊂{xn} and {xnj}⊂{xn} such that {xnj} converges weakly to z2∈K and z1≠z2. Again in the same way, we can prove that z2∈F⁢(S)∩F⁢(T). From Lemma 3.1 the limits limn→∞⁡∥xn-z1∥ and limn→∞⁡∥xn-z2∥ exists. Suppose that z1≠z2, then by the Opial’s condition, we get

	limn→∞⁡∥xn-z1∥	=limni→∞⁡∥xni-z1∥<limni→∞⁡∥xni-z2∥	
		=limn→∞⁡∥xn-z2∥=limnj→∞⁡∥xnj-z2∥	
		<limnj→∞⁡∥xnj-z1∥=limn→∞⁡∥xn-z1∥.	

This is a contradiction so z1=z2. Hence {xn} converges weakly to a common fixed point of T and S.

Theorem 3.4. Let E be a real uniformly convex Banach space and K,S,T,F,{xn} be as in Lemma 3.1. Then {xn} converges strongly to a point of F if and only if

	
lim infn→∞⁡d⁢(xn,F)=0.
	

Proof. Necessity is evident, let limin⁡fn→∞⁢d⁢(xn,F)=0. From Lemma 3.1. limn→∞⁡∥xn-p∥ exists for all p∈F, so that limn→∞⁡d⁢(xn,F) exists. Since by hypothesis, lim⁡i⁢n⁢fn→∞⁢d⁢(xn,F)=0, so that, we get

	
limn→∞⁡d⁢(xn,F)=0.
	

But {xn} is Cauchy sequence and therefore converges to p. We know that limn→∞⁡d⁢(xn,F)= 0 , we obtained d⁢(p,F)=0, therefore p∈F. Using Theorem 3.4, we obtain a strong convergence theorem of the iteration scheme 1.4) under the condition (A′) as below:

TWO-STEP ITERATION SCHEME FOR NONEXPANSIVE MAPPINGS.. 91 Theorem 3.5. Let E be a uniformly convex Banach space and K,S,T,,F,{xn} be as in Lemma 3.1. Let S,T satisfy the condition (A′) and F≠ϕ. Then {xn} converges strongly to a point of F. Proof. We proved in Lemma 3.1, i.e.

	
limn→∞⁡∥S⁢xn-xn∥=0=limn→∞⁡∥T⁢xn-xn∥
	

Then from the definition of condition (A′), we obtain or

	
limn→∞⁡f⁢(d⁢(xn,F))≤limn→∞⁡∥T⁢xn-xn∥=0
	
	
limn→∞⁡f⁢(d⁢(xn,F))≤limn→∞⁡∥S⁢xn-xn∥=0.
	

In above cases, we get

	
limn→∞⁡f⁢(d⁢(xn,F))=0.
	

But f:[0,∞)→[0,∞) is a nondecreasing function satisfying f⁢(0)=0,f⁢(r)>0 for all r∈(0,∞), so that we get

	
limn→∞⁡d⁢(xn,F)=0.
	

All the conditions of Theorem 3.4 are satisfied, therefore by its conclusion {xn} converges to strongly to a fixed point of F.

The following results are immediate sequel of our strong convergence theorem. Corollary 3.6. . Let K be a nonempty closed convex subset of a uniformly convex Banach space E. Suppose T be a nonexpansive mapping of K. Let {xn} be defined by the iteration (1.4), where {αn} and {βn} in [0,1] for all n∈ℕ, then {xn} converges strongly to a fixed point of T. Proof. Suppose S=T in the above theorem. Corollary 3.7. . Let K be a nonempty closed convex subset of a uniformly convex Banach space E. Suppose T be a nonexpansive mapping of K. Let {xn} be defined by the iteration (1.2), where {αn} in [0,1] for all n∈ℕ, then {xn} converges strongly to a fixed point of T. Proof. Suppose S=I in the above theorem. REFERENCES [1] H.

exists for each x,y∈K; (ii) Frèchet differentiable norm (see e.g. [12]) for each x in S, the above limit exists and is attained uniformly for y in S and in this case, it is also well-known that

	
⟨h,J⁢(x)⟩+12⁢∥x∥2≤12⁢∥x+h∥2≤⟨h,J⁢(x)⟩+12⁢∥x∥2+b⁢(∥h∥)
	

for all x,h∈E, where J is the Frèchet derivative of the function 12∥⋅∥2 at x∈E, ⟨.,.⟩isthedualpairingbetweenE and E*, and b is an increasing function defined on [0,∞) such that limt→0⁡b⁢(t)t=0; (iii) Opial’s condition [13] if for any sequence {xn} in E,xn→x implies that

	
lim supn→∞⁡∥xn-x∥<lim supn→∞⁡∥xn-y∥,
	

for all y∈E with y≠x. Following are the definitions and lemma used to prove the results in the next section.

Definition 2.1. A self-mapping T of a subset K of a normed linear space is said to be nonexpansive if

	
∥T⁢x-T⁢y∥≤∥x-y∥
	

holds for all x,y∈K.

TWO-STEP ITERATION SCHEME FOR NONEXPANSIVE MAPPINGS.. 23 Definition 2.2. A self-mapping T of a subset K of a normed linear space is said to be quasi-nonexpansive provided T has at least one fixed point in K, and if p∈K is any fixed point of T, then

	
∥T⁢x-p∥≤∥x-p∥,
	

holds for all x∈K. Definition 2.3. Let E be a uniformly convex Banach space, K be a nonempty closed convex subset of E, and T:K→K be a nonexpansive mapping. Then I-T is said to be demi-closed at 0 , if xn→x converges weakly and xn-T⁢xn→0 converges strongly, then it is implies that x∈K and T⁢x=x.

Definition 2.4. [1] . Suppose two mappings S,T:K→K, where K is a subset of a normed space E, said to be satisfy condition (A′) if there exists a nondecreasing function F:[0,∞)→[0,∞) with F⁢(0)=0,f⁢(r)>0 for all r∈(0,∞) such that either ∥x-S⁢x∥≥f⁢(d⁢(x,F)) or ∥x-T⁢x∥≥f⁢(d⁢(x,F)) for all x∈K where d(x,F)=inf{∥x-p∥:p∈F=F(S)∩F(T)}.

Lemma 2.5. [3]: Suppose that E be a uniformly convex Banach space and 0< p≤tn≤q<1 for all n∈ℕ. Let {xn} and {yn} be two sequences of E such that lim supn→∞⁡∥xn∥≤r, limsup pn→∞⁢∥yn∥≤r and limn→∞⁡∥(1-tn)⁢xn+tn⁢yn∥=r hold for some r≥0. Then limn→∞⁡∥xn-yn∥=0. 3. Convergence Results : In this section, we have proved the approximate common fixed points of two nonexpansive mapping for weak and strong convergence results, using a new type of iteration process. In the consequence, F denotes the set of common fixed point of the mapping S and T.

Lemma 3.1. : Let K be a nonempty convex subset of a uniformly convex Banach space E. Suppose S,T:K→K be an nonexpansive mappings and {xn} be the sequence as defined by (1.4), with restrictions ∑n=1∞αn<∞, and ∑n=1∞βn<∞. If F⁢(S)∩F⁢(T)≠ϕ, and

	
∥x-S⁢y∥≤∥T⁢x-S⁢y∥, for all ⁢x,y∈K,
	

then

	
limn→∞⁡∥S⁢xn-xn∥=limn→∞⁡∥T⁢xn-xn∥=0,
	

for all p∈F⁢(S)∩F⁢(T). Proof. Suppose p∈F⁢(S)∩F⁢(T) and F⁢(S)∩F⁢(T)≠ϕ. Since S,T are nonexpansive mappings, now using 1.4, we have

	∥yn-p∥	=∥(1-βn)⁢S⁢xn+βn⁢T⁢xn-p∥	
		≤(1-βn)⁢∥S⁢xn-p∥+βn⁢∥T⁢xn-p∥	
		≤(1-βn)⁢∥xn-p∥+βn⁢∥xn-p∥	
		≤∥xn-p∥,	




24 M.R. YADAV, B.S. THAKUR, A.K. SHARMA and,

	∥xn+1-p∥	=∥(1-αn)⁢T⁢xn+αn⁢S⁢yn-p∥	
		≤(1-αn)⁢∥T⁢xn-p∥+αn⁢∥S⁢yn-p∥	
		≤(1-αn)⁢∥xn-p∥+αn⁢∥yn-p∥	
		≤(1-αn)⁢∥xn-p∥+αn⁢∥xn-p∥	
		≤∥xn-p∥.	

Since {∥xn-p∥} is a non-increasing and bounded sequence, so limn→∞⁡∥xn-p∥ exist. Let limn→∞⁡∥xn-p∥=c and suppose that c>0, we get

	c	=limn→∞⁡∥xn+1-p∥	
		=limn→∞⁡∥(1-αn)⁢T⁢xn+αn⁢S⁢yn-p∥	
		=limn→∞⁡(1-αn)⁢∥T⁢xn-p∥+αn⁢∥S⁢yn-p∥.	

Lemma 2.5 gives

	
limn→∞⁡∥T⁢xn-S⁢yn∥=0.
	

Now, from (3.2) and (3.3), we have

	
lim supn→∞⁡∥S⁢yn-p∥≤lim supn→∞⁡∥yn-p∥≤lim supn→∞⁡∥xn-p∥⁢, 
	

also

	
lim supn→∞⁡∥T⁢xn-p∥≤lim supn→∞⁡∥xn-p∥=c.
	

It follows from (3.1) and (3.5),

	∥T⁢xn-xn∥	=∥T⁢xn-S⁢yn∥+∥S⁢yn-xn∥	
		≤∥T⁢xn-S⁢yn∥+∥T⁢xn-S⁢yn∥	
		≤2⁢∥T⁢xn-S⁢yn∥	
		→0⁢ as ⁢n→∞	

Taking limsup on both sides of the above inequality, we obtain

	
limn→∞⁡∥T⁢xn-xn∥=0,
	

and hence

	∥S⁢yn-xn∥	≤∥S⁢yn-T⁢xn∥+∥T⁢xn-xn∥	
		→0⁢ as ⁢n→∞	

Using (3.8) and 3.9, we have

	∥S⁢xn-xn∥	≤∥S⁢xn-S⁢yn∥+∥S⁢yn-xn∥	
		≤∥yn-xn∥+∥S⁢yn-xn∥	
		≤(1-βn)⁢∥S⁢xn-xn∥+βn⁢∥T⁢xn-xn∥+∥S⁢yn-xn∥	
		≤1βn⁢(βn⁢∥T⁢xn-xn∥+∥S⁢yn-xn∥),	

which implies that

	
limn→∞⁡∥S⁢xn-xn∥=0.
	




TWO-STEP ITERATION SCHEME FOR NONEXPANSIVE MAPPINGS.. 25 This completes the proof. Example 3.1 : Let E be the real line with the usual norm |.|andsuppose K=[0,1]. Define S,T:K→K by

	
T⁢x=2-x2⁢ and ⁢S⁢y=4-y5
	

for all x,y∈K. Obviously both S and T are nonexpansive with the common fixed point 23 for all x,y∈K. Now we check that our condition ∥x-S⁢y∥≤∥T⁢x-S⁢x∥ for all x,y∈K is true. If x,y∈[0,1], then

	
|x-S⁢y|=|x-(4-y)5|=|5⁢x+y-45|⁢, and 
	
	
|T⁢x-S⁢y|=|2-x2-4-y5|=|2⁢y-5⁢x+210|.
	

Clearly, |5⁢x+y-45|≤|2⁢y-5⁢x+210|, so that |x-S⁢y|≤|T⁢x-S⁢x| for all x,y∈K. Now, we check that S and T are quasi-nonexpansive type mappings. In fact, if x∈[0,1] and p∈[0,1], then

	
|T⁢x-p|=|2-x2-0|=|2-x2|=|2-x2|≤|x|=|x-0|=|x-p|,
	

that is

	
|T⁢x-p|≤|x-p|.
	

Similarly, we prove that

	
|S⁢x-p|≤|x-p|.
	

Therefore, S and T are quasi-nonexpansive type mappings. Lemma 3.2. : Let K be a nonempty closed convex subset of a uniformly convex Banach space E. Suppose {xn} be the sequence defined in Theorem 3.3 with F≠ϕ. Then, for any p1,p2∈F,limn→∞⁡⟨xn,J⁢(p1-p2)⟩ exist, in particular, ⟨p-q,J⁢(p1-p2)⟩=0 for all p,q∈ωω⁢(xn).

Proof. Take x=p1-p2, with p1≠p2 and h=t⁢(xn-p1) in the inequality (2.1) to get: 12⁢∥p1-p2∥2+t⁢⟨xn-p1,J⁢(p1-p2)⟩≤12⁢∥t⁢xn+(1-t)⁢p1-p2∥2 ≤12⁢∥p1-p2∥2+t⁢⟨xn-p1,J⁢(p1-p2)⟩+b⁢(t⁢∥xn-p1∥). As supn≥1⁡∥xn-p1∥≤M′ for some M′>0, it follows that

	12⁢∥p1-p2∥2+t	lim supn→∞⁡⟨xn-p1,J⁢(p1-p2)⟩	
		≤12⁢limn→∞⁡∥t⁢xn+(1-t)⁢p1-p2∥2	
		≤12⁢∥p1-p2∥2+b⁢(t⁢M′)+t⁢lim infn→∞⁡⟨xn-p1,J⁢(p1-p2)⟩.	

That is,

	
lim supn→∞⁡⟨xn-p1,J⁢(p1-p2)⟩≤lim infn→∞⁡⟨xn-p1,J⁢(p1-p2)⟩+b⁢(t⁢M′)t⁢M′⁢M′.
	




26 M.R. YADAV, B.S. THAKUR, A.K. SHARMA If t→0, then limn→∞⁡⟨xn-p1,J⁢(p1-p2)⟩ exists for all p1,p2∈F, in particular, we get

	
⟨p-1,J⁢(p1-p2)⟩=0
	

for all p,q∈ωω⁢(xn). Theorem 3.3. Let E be a uniformly convex Banach space satisfying Opial condition and K,T,S and {xn} be taken as Lemma 3.1. If F⁢(S)∩F⁢(T)≠ϕ,I-T and I-S are demiclosded at zero, then {xn} converges weakly to a common fixed point of S and T.

Proof. Let p∈F⁢(S)∩F⁢(T), then as proved in Lemma 3.1 limn→∞⁡∥xn-p∥ exist. Since E is uniformly convex Banach space. Thus there exists subsequences {xnk}⊂{xn} such that {xnk} converges weakly to z1∈K. From Lemma 3.1 we have and

	
limn→∞⁡∥T⁢xnk-xnk∥=0,
	
	
limn→∞⁡∥S⁢xnk-xnk∥=0.
	

Since I-T and I-S are demiclosed at zero, therefore S⁢z1=z1. Similarly T⁢z1=z1. Finally, we prove that {xn} converges weakly to z1. Let on contrary that there exists a subsequence {xni}⊂{xn} and {xnj}⊂{xn} such that {xnj} converges weakly to z2∈K and z1≠z2. Again in the same way, we can prove that z2∈F⁢(S)∩F⁢(T). From Lemma 3.1 the limits limn→∞⁡∥xn-z1∥ and limn→∞⁡∥xn-z2∥ exists. Suppose that z1≠z2, then by the Opial’s condition, we get

	limn→∞⁡∥xn-z1∥	=limni→∞⁡∥xni-z1∥<limni→∞⁡∥xni-z2∥	
		=limn→∞⁡∥xn-z2∥=limnj→∞⁡∥xnj-z2∥	
		<limnj→∞⁡∥xnj-z1∥=limn→∞⁡∥xn-z1∥.	

This is a contradiction so z1=z2. Hence {xn} converges weakly to a common fixed point of T and S.

Theorem 3.4. Let E be a real uniformly convex Banach space and K,S,T,F,{xn} be as in Lemma 3.1. Then {xn} converges strongly to a point of F if and only if

	
lim infn→∞⁡d⁢(xn,F)=0.
	

Proof. Necessity is evident, let lim⁡infn→∞⁡d⁢(xn,F)=0. From Lemma 3.1 limn→∞⁡∥xn-p∥ exists for all p∈F, so that limn→∞⁡d⁢(xn,F) exists. Since by hypothesis, lim⁡i⁢n⁢fn→∞⁢d⁢(xn,F)=0, so that, we get

	
limn→∞⁡d⁢(xn,F)=0.
	

But {xn} is Cauchy sequence and therefore converges to p. We know that limn→∞⁡d⁢(xn,F)= 0 , we obtained d⁢(p,F)=0, therefore p∈F. Using Theorem 3.4 we obtain a strong convergence theorem of the iteration scheme (1.4) under the condition (A′) as below:

TWO-STEP ITERATION SCHEME FOR NONEXPANSIVE MAPPINGS.. 27 Theorem 3.5. Let E be a uniformly convex Banach space and K,S,T,F,{xn} be as in Lemma 3.1 Let S,T satisfy the condition (A′) and F≠ϕ. Then {xn} converges strongly to a point of F. Proof. We proved in Lemma 3.1 i.e.

	
limn→∞⁡∥S⁢xn-xn∥=0=limn→∞⁡∥T⁢xn-xn∥
	

Then from the definition of condition (A′), we obtain

	
limn→∞⁡f⁢(d⁢(xn,F))≤limn→∞⁡∥T⁢xn-xn∥=0
	

or

	
limn→∞⁡f⁢(d⁢(xn,F))≤limn→∞⁡∥S⁢xn-xn∥=0.
	

In above cases, we get

	
limn→∞⁡f⁢(d⁢(xn,F))=0.
	

But f:[0,∞)→[0,∞) is a nondecreasing function satisfying f⁢(0)=0,f⁢(r)>0 for all r∈(0,∞), so that we get

	
limn→∞⁡d⁢(xn,F)=0.
	

All the conditions of Theorem 3.4 are satisfied, therefore by its conclusion {xn} converges to strongly to a fixed point of F.

The following results are immediate sequel of our strong convergence theorem. Corollary 3.6. . Let K be a nonempty closed convex subset of a uniformly convex Banach space E. Suppose T be a nonexpansive mapping of K. Let {xn} be defined by the iteration 1.4), where {αn} and {βn} in [0,1] for all n∈ℕ, then {xn} converges strongly to a fixed point of T. Proof. Suppose S=T in the above theorem. Corollary 3.7. . Let K be a nonempty closed convex subset of a uniformly convex Banach space E. Suppose T be a nonexpansive mapping of K. Let {xn} be defined by the iteration (1.2), where {αn} in [0,1] for all n∈ℕ, then {xn} converges strongly to a fixed point of T. Proof. Suppose S=I in the above theorem. References [1] H.

The solution of problem (1.1) with the dyadic von Koch-type curve γ as boundary Suppose that u⁢(t,x,y) is the solution of the problem (1.1). For the boundary γ, consider its first, second ,…,k-th approximation (Figure 1)

Then, for k=1,2,…, solve the following problems, respectively:

536 W. Su To solve the equation ∂2⁡uk∂⁡t2=∂2⁡uk∂⁡x2+∂2⁡uk∂⁡y2, assume that uk⁢(t,x,y)=Tk⁢(t)⁢vk⁢(x,y). Then, we have

	
Tk′′⁢(t)⁢vk⁢(x,y)=Tk⁢(t)⁢(∂2⁡vk⁢(x,y)∂⁡x2+∂2⁡vk⁢(x,y)∂⁡y2)
	

If Tk⁢(t)≠0,vk⁢(x,y)≠0, then

	
1vk⁢(x,y)⁢(∂2⁡vk⁢(x,y)∂⁡x2+∂2⁡vk⁢(x,y)∂⁡y2)=Tk′′⁢(t)Tk⁢(t)
	

By the method of separation of variables, let the right-hand side of the above equality equal to -(λ2+μ2), where λ,μ are positive constants. We have

	
∂2⁡vk⁢(x,y)∂⁡x2+∂2⁡vk⁢(x,y)∂⁡y2=-(λ2+μ2)⁢vk⁢(x,y)
	

and

	
Tk′′⁢(t)+(λ2+μ2)⁢Tk⁢(t)=0.
	

For (2.2), we have the following special solution:

	
vk⁢(x,y)=sin⁡λ⁢x⁢sin⁡μ⁢y
	

Now we can determine λ and μ of (2.4) by the boundary conditions vk|γk=0. For k=1,2,…, consider the equation

	
{∂2⁡vk⁢(x,y)∂⁡x2+∂2⁡vk⁢(x,y)∂⁡y2=-(λ2+μ2)⁢vk⁢(x,y),(x,y)∈Dk,
vk⁢(x,y)|γk=0.

(2) the inequality

holds, then the function λ⁢(t0,x,y0) is continuous, but differentiable nowhere in its domain.

Proof By the hypothesis, the series λ⁢(t,x,y) is absolutely uniformly convergent, so φ⁢(x)=Θ⁢(t0,x,y0) is a continuous function.

On the other hand, φ⁢(x) is a bounded function which satisfies Lipschitz condition with the Lipschitz constant A, applying the pre-theorem to b=4,l=1 and λ>0, we conclude that λ⁢(t0,x,y0) is continuous, but differentiable nowhere in its domain.

(ii) For k=2, two sequences of eigenvalues of (6.7) are obtained:

Therefore Vn⁢(pm⁢G,A∩pm⁢G)=0 for all n≥0. Let B be a basic subgroup of A∩pm⁢G. Then A/B=((A∩pm⁢G)/B)⊕(M/B) for some subgroup M of A. From Lemma 2.2 of [ 1],M is pure in A and M/B≃(A+pm⁢G)/pm⁢G is bounded. It follows that M is also a direct sum of cyclic groups, and in fact M is a basic subgroup of A. Now by hypothesis, M is purifiable in G, therefore M∩pm⁢G=B is purifiable in pm⁢G by Theorem 2.4. Thus B is a purifiable basic subgroup of A∩pm(r in pm⁢G, and Vn⁢(pm⁢G,B)=0 for all n≥0.

Then Nn⁢(M)=Nn⁢(M)=Soc⁡(N∩Hn⁢(M))+Soc⁡(Hn+1⁢(M)). Since N is almost h-dense in M, therefore by Theorem 2.3, we get Soc(Hn(M))=Soc(N∩ Hn(M))+Soc(Hn+1(M)) for all n⩾m.

"2.3. Proposition. Let B be a basic subgroup of A. If A is purifiable in G, then B is purifiable in G.

Proof. Let K be a pure hull of A in G. Since A/B is divisible we have K/B=(A/B)⊕(R/B) for some subgroup R of K. From Lemma 2.2 in [1], R is pure in K, and thus R is pure in G. Let H be a pure subgroup of G such that B⊂H⊂R. Then A+H is a pure subgroup of G. Indeed, since A=pn⁢A+B, we have A+H=pn⁢A+H, and therefore (A+H)∩pn⁢G=(pn⁢A+H)∩pn⁢G=pn⁢A+H∩pn⁢G=pn⁢A+pn⁢H=pn⁢(A+H) for all n≥0. Since K is a pure hull of A, we have A+H=K and R=(A+H)∩R=H+A∩R=H+B=H. Therefore R is a pure hull of B.

If A∩pn⁢G is purifiable in pn⁢G for some n≥1, then A is purifiable in G. Conversely, if A is purifiable in G, then A∩pn⁢G is purifiable in pn⁢G for all n≥0. We also need the following lemmas. 2.5.

Proof. As in Proposition 2.4, A+H is a pure subgroup of G containing A. Now (A∩H)⁢[p]=B⁢[p]. Thus A∩H is an essential extension of B in A. It follows that A∩H=B, since pure subgroups have no proper essential extensions. It is then routine to check that (A+H)⁢[p]=A⁢[p], and that A+H is a pure hull of A in G.
","Proposition 3.2: If B is a h-pure and h-dense submodule of a submodule K of a QTAG-module M. If K is h-purifiable in M, then B is h-purifiable in M.

Proof: Let T be a h-pure hull of K in M. Since B is h-dense in K we get, K/B is h-divisible, so T/B=K/B⊕L/B. Appealing to [Proposition 2.5,4 ] we get, L to be h-pure submodule of T and hence L is h-pure in M. Let N be a h-pure submodule of M such that B⊆N⊆L. Then we claim that K+N is a h-pure submodule of M. Since K=B+Hn⁢(K), we have K+N=Hn⁢(K)+N. Therefore,

	(K+N)∩Hn⁢(M)	=(Hn⁢(K)+N)∩Hn⁢(M)	
		=Hn⁢(K)+(N∩Hn⁢(M))	
		=Hn⁢(K)+Hn⁢(N)

for all n⩾0. Since T is a h-pure hull of K in M, we have K+N=T and

	
L=(K+N)∩L=N+(K∩L)=N+B=N
	

Therefore, L is a h-pure hull of B in M. Proposition 3.3: If B is a h-pure and h-dense submodule of a submodule K of a QTAG-module M and if N be a h-pure hull of B in M and Soc⁡(N)=Soc⁡(B), then K+N is a h-pure hull of K in M.

Proof: Since K/B is h-divisible, we have K=B+Hn⁢(K). Now K+N=B+ Hn⁢(K)+N=N+Hn⁢(K) and hence (K+N)∩Hn⁢(M)=(N+Hn⁢(K))∩Hn⁢(M)= Hn⁢(K)+N∩Hn⁢(M)=Hn⁢(K)+Hn⁢(N)=Hn⁢(K+N) for all n⩾0. Therefore, K+N is h-pure submodule of M. Since Soc⁡(N)=Soc⁡(B), so Soc⁡(K∩N)=Soc⁡(B), so N∩K is an essential extension of B in K. Since h-pure submodules have no proper essential extensions, therefore we get, K∩N=B. Now we show that Soc⁡(K+N)=Soc⁡(K), which will yield that N+K is h-pure hull of K in M. Using [Lemma 1, 2] we can proceed as: If x∈Soc⁡(K+N) then H1⁢(x⁢R)=0 and x=k+t where k∈K,t∈N, then H1⁢(t⁢R)=H1⁢(k⁢R)⊆N∩K=B∩H1⁢(K)=H1⁢(B). Hence, H1⁢(t⁢R)=H1⁢(k⁢R)=H1⁢(b⁢R) for b∈B.

Proof: Since K/B is h-divisible, we have K=B+Hn⁢(K). Now K+N=B+ Hn⁢(K)+N=N+Hn⁢(K) and hence (K+N)∩Hn⁢(M)=(N+Hn⁢(K))∩Hn⁢(M)= Hn⁢(K)+N∩Hn⁢(M)=Hn⁢(K)+Hn⁢(N)=Hn⁢(K+N) for all n⩾0.

"THEOREM 5.3. Let A be a subgroup of G. If A is purifiable in G then A∩pn⁢G is purifiable in pn⁢G for all n≥0. Conversely, if A∩pn⁢G is purifiable in pn⁢G for some n≥1 then A is purifiable in G.

ProOF. Let K be a pure hull of A in G then pn⁢K=(pn⁢G)∩K⊃A∩pn⁢G and pn⁢K is a pure hull of A∩pn⁢G in pn⁢G. Indeed, if H is a pure subgroup of pn⁢G and pn⁢K⊃H⊃ A∩pn⁢G=A∩pn⁢K, by Proposition 2.9, we can extend A+H to a pure subgroup M of K such that M∩pn⁢K=H. (Note (A+H)∩pn⁢K=H+A∩pn⁢K=H.) Thus M=K and H=pn⁢K. Conversely, suppose A∩pn⁢G is purifiable in pn⁢G and let H be a pure hull of A∩pn⁢G in pn⁢G. As above (A+H)∩pn⁢G=H and A+H can be extended to a pure subgroup K of G such that K∩pn⁢G=H. Clearly, H=pn⁢K. By [1, Theorem 2.1] there exists m≥0 such that pm⁢H⁢[p]⊂pn⁢G. Thus pm+n⁢K⁢[p]⊂A⊂K.

Conversely, if N∩Hn⁢(M) is h-purifiable in Hn⁢(M) for some n⩾1, then N is h-purifiable in M.

Proof: Let K be h-pure hull of N in M, then trivially Hn⁢(K) is h-pure submodule Hn⁢(M) for all n∈Z+. Also Hn⁢(K)=K∩Hn⁢(M)⊇N∩Hn⁢(M). Now we claim that Hn⁢(K) is h-pure hull of N∩Hn⁢(M) in Hn⁢(M). Let T be h-pure submodule of Hn⁢(M) such that Hn⁢(K)⊇T⊇N∩Hn⁢(M). Trivially N∩Hn⁢(K)⊆ N∩Hn⁢(M) and N∩Hn⁢(K)⊇T∩N⊇N∩Hn⁢(M); consequently Hn⁢(K)⊇T⊇ N∩Hn⁢(M)=N∩Hn⁢(K). Now appealing to [Theorem 4.12, 5], we can extend N+T to an h-pure submodule D of K such that D∩Hn⁢(K)=T (we can note that (N+T)∩Hn(K)=T+N∩Hn(K)=T). Thus, D=K and we get Hn⁢(K)=T.

"2.8. Theorem. Let G/A and H/B be totally projective with A and B nice subgroups with uG,A=uH,B. Then any height preserving isomorphism ϕ:A→B extends to an isomorphism G→H.

Proof. Let fα:pα⁢G⁢[p]/A⁢(α)→pα⁢H⁢[p]/B⁢(α) be an isomorphism for each ordinal α. Let 𝒞 and 𝒟 be systems of nice subgroups of G/A and H/B, respectively, satisfying the conditions of 2.7.

Zorn’s lemma applies in the obvious way, so there is a maximal such ϕ0:C→D. Condition (b) yields uG,C=uH,D-. and D are nice by 2.4, and for each α,fα induces an isomorphism (pα⁢G)⁢[p]/C⁢(α)→(pα⁢H)⁢[p]/D⁢(α). Suppose G≠C, and let g∈G\C. By 2.6 there are nice subgroups A1=C+ Z⁢g and B1, and a height preserving isomorphism A1→B1 extending ϕ0 such that fα induces an isomorphism A1⁢(α)/C⁢(α)→B1⁢(α)/D⁢(α), and hence an isomorphism A1⁢(α)/A⁢(α)→B1⁢(α)/B⁢(α). Now A1⊂C1 with C1/A∈𝒞 and with C1=A1+∑i=1∞Z⁢x1⁢i. There is a height preserving isomorphism A1+ Z⁢x11→B2 satisfying condition (b), and extending the isomorphism A1→B1. Now B2⊂D2=B2+∑i-1∞Z⁢y2⁢i with D2/B∈𝒟, and there is a height preserving isomorphism A2→B2+Z⁢y21 that extends our previous one and which satisfies condition (b). Now A2⊂C2=A2+∑i-1∞Z⁢x2⁢i with C2/A∈𝒞. There is a height preserving isomorphism A2+Z⁢x12+Z⁢x21→B3 extending our previous one and satisfying condition (b). Now B3⊂D3=B3+ ∑i=1∞Z⁢y3⁢i with D3/B∈𝒟. There is a height preserving isomorphism A3→ B3+Z⁢y22+Z⁢y31 extending our previous one and satisfying condition (b). Continuing in this manner we get a height preserving isomorphism ⋃Ci=⋃Ai→⋃Di extending ϕ0 and satisfying condition (b). But (⋃Ci)/A∈𝒞 and (⋃Di)/B∈𝒟. We conclude that C=G.

Then every height preserving isomorphism ψ:N→N′ extends to an isomorphism from M to M′.

Proof. Let ψα:Soc⁡(Hα⁢(M))/N⁢(α)→Soc⁡(Hα⁢(M′))/N′⁢(α) be an isomorphism for every ordinal α. Since M/N and M′/N′ are totally projective, there exist families 𝒜,𝒜′ of nice submodules of M/N and M′/N′ respectively [Definition 2.8].

Now K⊂L1 such that L1=K+∑i=1∞x1⁢i⁢R, L1/N∈𝒜. Again there is a height preserving isomorphism mapping K+x1⁢i⁢R onto K1′ which is an extension of the isomorphism K→K′. Now K1′⊂L1′=K1′+∑i=1∞y2⁢i⁢R with L1′/N′∈𝒜′ and there is a height preserving isomorphism K1→K1′+y21⁢R which extends the previous isomorphism. Now K1⊂L2=K1+∑i=1∞x2⁢i⁢R with L2/N∈𝒜. This implies that there is a height preserving isomorphism K1+x12⁢R+x21⁢R→K2′ extending the previous isomorphism. Now K2′⊂L2′=K2′+∑i=1∞y3⁢i⁢R with L2′/N′∈ 𝒜′. On repeating the process we get a height preserving isomorphism from ∪Li= ∪Ki→∪Li′, extending ψ0 and satisfying the given conditions. But (∪Li)/N∈𝒜 and (∪Li′)/N′∈𝒜′. This implies that L=M. Similarly L′=M′.

"2.1. Definition [5]. A subgroup A of G is nice if every coset of A has a representative of the same height, i.e., if for each g∈G,ht(g+A)= ht (g+a) for some a in A, where the two heights are computed in G/A and in G, respectively.

If A is nice in G, then certainly every coset of A has a representative of maximum height. The converse is less obvious, but true. 2.2. LEMMA. A is nice in G if and only if every coset of A contains an element of maximum height.

Proof. Suppose that every coset of A has an element of maximum height. If A is not nice, let g+A be a coset of minimum height such that ht⁢(g+A)>ht⁢(g) and g is of maximum height in g+A. Write g+A= p⁢(x+A) with ht⁢(x+A)≧ht⁢(g) and with x of maximum height in x+A. Since p⁢x=g+a, ht (x)<ht⁢(g). Therefore ht (x)=ht⁢(x+A)≧ht⁢(g). This is a contradiction, and hence A is nice in G. The converse is obvious, as noted.","In a Q⁢T⁢A⁢G-module M, a submodule N⊂M is nice if Hσ(M/N)=(Hσ(M)+ N)/N for all ordinals σ, i.e. every coset of M modulo N may be represented by an element of the same height and x is said to be proper with respect to N if x is the element of maximum height in x+N [3]. We start by the following result: Proposition 2.1. In a Q⁢T⁢A⁢G-module M,N⊂M is nice in M if and only if every coset of N contains an element of maximum height.

"2.6. Lemma. Suppose that G/A and H/B are reduced p-groups, A and B are nice subgroups of G and H, respectively, and ϕ:A→B is a height preserving isomorphism. Suppose that uG,A=uH,B, and let fα:(pα⁢G)⁢[p]/A⁢(α)→ (pα⁢H)⁢[p]/B⁢(α) be an isomorphism for each α.

We may assume that x∈A,p⁢x∈A, and that x is proper with respect to A. If possible, x is also chosen so that ht⁢(p⁢x)>ht⁢(x)+1. Let ht (x)=β.

Case 1. ht (p⁢x)>β+1. Let p⁢x=p⁢y with ht (y)>β. Then x-y has order p and height β, and is proper with respect to A. Thus 0≠fβ⁢(x-y+A⁢(β))= z+B⁢(β), and so z is of order p and height β, and is proper with respect to B. Let ϕ⁢(p⁢x)=p⁢w with ht (w)>β. Extend ϕ by sending x to w+z. Let A1= A+Z⁢x, and let B1=B+Z⁢(w+z). The subgroups A1 and B1 are nice since A1/A and B1/B are finite and A and B are nice. If α≠β, then A1⁢(α)=A⁢(α) and B1⁢(α)=B⁢(α), and fα certainly induces an isomorphism A1⁢(α)/A⁢(α)→ B1⁢(α)/B⁢(α). If α=β, then x-y∈A1⁢(α), and 0≠fα⁢(x-y+A⁢(α))=z+B⁢(α)∈ B1⁢(α)/B⁢(α). Now A1/A has p elements, and there is a natural epimorphism A1/A→A1⁢(α)/A⁢(α). Thus dim⁡(A1⁢(α)/A⁢(α))=dim⁡(B1⁢(α)/B⁢(α))=1, and fα induces an isomorphism as required. This proves parts (a), (b), and (c). Part (d) follows from (c).

390 E. A. WALKER [February Case 2. ht (p⁢x)=β+1. Let ϕ⁢(p⁢x)=p⁢w with ht (w)≧β. Then ht (w)=β since ht (p⁢w)=β+1. If ht (w+b)≧β+1 with b∈B, then ht (b)=β,b=ϕ⁢(a) with ht (a)=β, and ht (x+a)=β. Thus x+a is proper with respect to A and ht (p⁢(x+a))>β+1, and we are in Case 1 . Hence w is proper with respect to B. If w∈B, then w=0 and ht (w)>ht⁡(x). Extend ϕ by sending x to w. Let A1=A+Z⁢x and B1=B+Z⁢w. Again, if α>β, then x∈pα+1⁢G, and so a+x+g+A⁢(α)=0, and so A1⁢(α)/A⁢(α)=0=B1⁢(α)/B⁢(α). If α=β, then ht (a+x)=β, and h⁢t⁢(p⁢(a+x))>β+1 and we are in Case 1.

Let f:N→N′ be a height preserving isomorphism and fα⁢(M,N)=fα⁢(M′,N′). For each ordinal α consider an isomorphism ψα:Soc⁡(Hα⁢(M))/N⁢(α)→Soc⁡(Hα⁢(M′))/N′⁢(α). If x∈M, then there are nice submodules K and K′ of M and M′ respectively and a height preserving isomorphism f1:K→K′ extending f such that (a) K=N+x⁢R (b) K/N and K′/N′ are finitely generated (c) for each ordinal α,ψα induces an isomorphism K⁢(α)/N⁢(α)→K′⁢(α)/N′⁢(α) (d) fα⁢(M,K)=fα⁢(M′,K′) Proof. Consider an element x∈M which is proper with respect to N such that there exists an element y∈N satisfying d⁢(x⁢R/y⁢R)⩾1. Now H⁢(y)>H⁢(x)+1. Let H⁢(x)=β. Now two cases arise. Case 1. If H⁢(y)>β+1, consider an element z with H⁢(z)>β and y⁢R=z′⁢R where d⁢(z⁢Rz′⁢R)=1.

Then e⁢(x-z)=1,H⁢(x-z)=β and x-z is proper with respect to N. Therefore if ψβ⁢(x-z+N⁢(β))=u+N′⁢(β) then e⁢(u)=1 and H⁢(u)=β and u is proper with

58 ALVEERA MEHDI respect to N′. Consider an element w with height greater than β and d⁢(w⁢Rv⁢R)=1 for some v. We define f⁢(y)=v and extend f by sending x to w+u. We put K=N+x⁢R and K′=N′+(w+u)⁢R. The submodules K and K′ are nice because K/N,K′/N′ are finitely generated and N,N′ are nice. For the ordinals α(≠β),K⁢(α)=N⁢(α) and K′⁢(α)=N′⁢(α) and ψα induces an isomorphism K⁢(α)/N⁢(α)→K′⁢(α)/N′⁢(α). If α=β then x-z∈K⁢(α) and ψα⁢(x-z+N⁢(α))=u+N′⁢(α)∈K′⁢(α)/N′⁢(α). Now d⁢(K/N)=1 and there is a natural epimorphism K/N→K⁢(α)/N⁢(α). Therefore g⁢(K⁢(α)/N⁢(α))=g⁢(K′⁢(α)/N′⁢(α))=1 and ψα induces an isomorphism, implying (d). Case 2. If H⁢(y)=β+1. Again consider an element w such that H⁢(w)⩾β and an element v with d⁢(w⁢Rv⁢R)=1. Let f⁢(y)=v. Then H⁢(w)=β because H⁢(v)=β+1. If H⁢(w+w′)⩾β+1 where w′∈N′, then H⁢(w′)=β and w′=f⁢(u) where H⁢(u)=β and H⁢(x+u)=β. Therefore x+u is proper with respect to N and H⁢(x′)>β+1 where d⁢((x+u)⁢Rx′⁢R)=1. If w∈N′ then w=0 and H⁢(w)>H⁢(x), thus following case (i) we may infer that w is proper with respect to N. We may extend f by defining f⁢(x)=w. Let K=N+x⁢R and K′=N′+w⁢R. If α>β, then x∈Hα+1⁢(M) and u+x+N⁢(α)=0 therefore K⁢(α)/N⁢(α)=0=K′⁢(α)/N′⁢(α). If α=β then H⁢(x+u)=β and H⁢(x′)>β+1. Again by case (i) K⁢(α)/N⁢(α)=0=K′⁢(α)/N′⁢(α) and the result follows. A p-group is totally projective if and only if it has a nice system [Th 82.3,1]. On the similar lines it can be proved for Q⁢T⁢A⁢G-modules. Thus totally projective Q⁢T⁢A⁢G-modules may be defined in terms of nice submodules as follows: Definition 2.8.

"et G be an arbitrary group. We wish to study extensions by G of p-bounded groups. This amounts to studying the class ℰG of epimorphisms φ:A→G such that p ker φ=0. Two such epimorphisms φ1 and φ2 are equivalent if there exists an isomorphism f from the domain of φ1 to the domain of φ2 and an automorphism g of G such that g⁢φ1=φ2⁢f. We denote this situation by (g,f):φ1≅φ2. If φ:A→G is in ℰG we associate with φ a cardinal number m⁢(φ) and a subgroup P⁢(φ) of G in the following manner:

	
m⁢(φ)= vector space dimension of ⁢ker⁡φ/(p⁢A∩ker⁡φ),
P⁢(φ)=φ⁢(A⁢[p]).
	

These are the fundamental invariants for extensions of p-bounded groups by G. Let us agree that two subgroups S1 and S2 of G are equivalent if there is an automorphism g of G taking S1 onto S2 : we will write this as g:S1≅S2. If (g,f):φ1≅φ2 we clearly have m⁢(φ1)=m⁢(φ2) and g:P⁢(φ1)≅P⁢(φ2). Thus m and P are invariants. Conversely, we shall show that if m⁢(φ1)=m⁢(φ2) and g:P⁢(φ1)≅P⁢(φ2) then there exists an isomorphism f such that (g,f):φ1≅φ2. This implies that m and P form a complete set of invariants. The following lemma proves a little bit more for the case m=0.","Let M be a Q⁢T⁢A⁢G-module.

"Lemma 1. Let φ1:A1→G and φ2:A2→G be epimorphisms such that ker φi⊆ (p⁢Ai)⁢[p],i=1,2. Let g be an automorphism of G such that g⁢φ1⁢(A1⁢[p])=φ2⁢(A2⁢[p]). Let f be a map from a neat subgroup H of A1 to A2 such that φ2⁢f=g⁢φ1 on H. Then f can be extended to an isomorphism f¯:A1→A2 such that φ2⁢f¯=g⁢φ1.

Proof. For x∈p⁢A1 define f*⁢(x)=p⁢φ2-1⁢g⁢φ1⁢p-1⁢x. This is an additive relation in the sense of MacLaNe [3]. To show that it defines an honest homomorphism we must show that f*⁢(0)=0. But

	
p-1⁢0=A1⁢[p],g⁢φ1⁢(A1⁢[p])=φ2⁢(A2⁢[p]),
φ2-1⁢φ2⁢(A2⁢[p])=A2⁢[p]+ker⁡φ2=A2⁢[p], and ⁢p⁢(A2⁢[p])=0.
	

Similarly the map given by p⁢φ1-1⁢g-1⁢φ2⁢p-1 is a map from p⁢A2 to p⁢A1 which is clearly a two-sided inverse for f*. Thus f* is an isomorphism from p⁢A1 to p⁢A2 which, by definition, satisfies φ2⁢f*=g⁢φ1 on p⁢A1. Moreover, since H is neat and φ2⁢f=g⁢φ1, f* agrees with f on p⁢A1∩H=p⁢H. Hence we may extend the domain of f* to H+p⁢A1 by setting f*⁢(h)=f⁢(h) for h∈H. Now let {xi} be a set of representatives in A1 of a basis of the p-bounded group A1/(H+p⁢A1). Choose elements yi∈A2 such that g⁢φ1⁢(xi)=φ2⁢(yi). Define f¯⁢(x+∑ni⁢xi)=f*⁢(z)+∑ni⁢yi where z∈H+p⁢A1. Again we must show that f¯⁢(0)=0. But if z+∑ni⁢xi=0 then ni= =mi⁢p and since φ2⁢(mi⁢yi)=g⁢φ1⁢(mi⁢xi) we have, by the definition of f*, that f*⁢(p⁢mi⁢xi)=p⁢mi⁢yi. Hence

	
f¯⁢(z+∑ni⁢xi)=f*⁢(z)+∑f*⁢(p⁢mi⁢xi)=f*⁢(z+∑ni⁢xi)=f*⁢(0)=0.
	




Vol. XXI, 1970 Extensions of p-Bounded Groups 451 Clearly φ2⁢f~=g⁢φ1. Moreover, since f¯ is an isomorphism on p⁢A1 it must be one-toone, for if f¯⁢(x)=0 then φ2⁢f¯⁢(x)=g⁢φ1⁢(x)=0 and so x∈ker⁡φ1⊆p⁢A1. Since the image of f¯ contains p⁢A2⫆ker⁡φ2 and maps onto G under φ2 it must coincide with A2. Thus f¯ is an isomorphism.","Lemma 3.5. Let f1:N1→M and f2:N2→M be epimorphisms such that Ker fi⊆ Soc⁡(H1⁢(Ni)),i=1,2. Let ψ be an epimorphism of M such that ψ⁢f1⁢(Soc⁡(N1))= f2⁢(Soc⁡(N2)) and ϕ be a map from a h-neat submodule L of N1 to N2 such that f2⁢ϕ=ψ⁢f1 on L. Then ϕ may be extended to an epimorphism ϕ¯:N1→N2 such that f2⁢ϕ¯=ψ⁢f1.

Proof. Consider x∈H1⁢(N1). Now there exists y∈N1 such that d⁢(y⁢Rx⁢R)=1. Consider f2-1⁢ψ⁢f1⁢y=y′ (say). Now y′∈N2 and there exists x′∈N2 such that d⁢(y′⁢Rx′⁢R)=1. For x∈H1⁢(N1) we define ϕ*⁢(x)=x′. In order to prove that ϕ* is a homomorphism we have to show that ϕ*⁢(0)=0.

But e⁢(x)=1 for all x∈Soc(N1),ψf1(Soc(N1))=f2(Soc(N2)),f2-1f2(Soc(N2))= Soc⁡(N2)+Ker⁡f2=Soc⁡(N2) and H1⁢(Soc⁡(N2))=0.

Similarly the map given by x′→x, is a map from H1⁢(N2) to H1⁢(N1) which is an inverse for ϕ*. Thus ϕ* is an isomorphism from H1⁢(N1) to H1⁢(N2), satisfying f2⁢ϕ*= ψ⁢f1 on H1⁢(N1). Since L is h-neat and f2⁢ϕ=ψ⁢f1,ϕ*=ϕ on H1⁢(N1)∩L=H1⁢(L). By defining ϕ*⁢(z)=ϕ⁢(z) for all z∈L, we may extend the domain of ϕ* to L+H1⁢(N1). Now N1/(L+H1⁢(N1)) is 1-bounded. Consider the minimal generating set {x¯i} of N1/(L+H1⁢(N1)) where xi∈N1. Now the elements yi may be selected from N2 such that ψ⁢f1⁢(xi)=f2⁢(yi). We may define ϕ¯⁢(x+Σ⁢xi⁢ri)=ϕ*⁢(z)+Σ⁢yi⁢ri where z∈L+H1⁢(N1) Since f2⁢(yi⁢ri)=ψ⁢f1⁢(xi⁢ri),z+Σ⁢xi⁢ri=0 suggests that ϕ*⁢(xi′⁢ri)=yi′⁢ri where d⁢(xi′⁢Rxi⁢R)=d⁢(yi′⁢Ryi⁢R)=1, this implies that

	
ϕ¯⁢(z+Σ⁢xi⁢ri)=ϕ*⁢(z)+ϕ*⁢(Σ⁢xi⁢ri)=ϕ*⁢(z+Σ⁢xi⁢ri)=ϕ*⁢(0)=0,
	

again implying that f2⁢ϕ¯=ψ⁢f1 To prove that ϕ¯ is one to one consider ϕ¯⁢(x)=0.Now

	
f2⁢ϕ¯⁢(x)=ψ⁢f1⁢(x)=0,

"Lemma 2. Let φ1 and φ2 be homomorphisms from A1 and A2 onto G such that p ker φi= =0,i=1,2, and ker⁡φ1/(p⁢A1∩ker⁡φ1) is isomorphic to ker φ2/(p⁢A2∩ker⁡φ2). Then if g is an automorphism of G such that g⁢φ1⁢(A1⁢[p])=φ2⁢(A2⁢[p]) there exists an isomorphism f:A1→A2 such that φ2⁢f=g⁢φ1.

Proof. Let ker φi=Bi⊕(p⁢Ai∩ker⁡φi),i=1,2. Note that B1 is isomorphic to B2. Since Bi is pure in Ai we have Ai=Bi⊕Ai*. Apply Lemma 1 , where H=0, to get a map from A1* to A2* and combine with any isomorphism from B1 to B2 to get the desired f.

We have shown that m and P are a complete set of invariants for extensions of p-bounded groups by G. We now address ourselves to the question of the existence of extensions with prescribed invariants. The answer is the best that one could hope for. Lemma 3. Let G be a group, m a cardinal number and P a subgroup of G⁢[p]. Then there exists an epimorphism φ:A→G with p-bounded kernel such that m⁢(φ)=m and P⁢(φ)=P

Proof. Let G0 be a group such that p⁢G0=G and G0⁢[p]=G⁢[p] (this is always possible; G0 is a ” p-extension” of G, see [4]). Let S be a direct sum of m groups of order p. Let A=S⊕G0/P and define φ:A→G by φ⁢(s)=0 for s∈S and φ⁢(g0+P)= =p⁢g0 for g0∈G0. An element s+(g0+P) is in A⁢[p] if and only if p⁢g0∈P. Hence φ⁢(A⁢[p])=P. Since φ⁢(s+(g0+P))=0 if and only if p⁢g0=0, and G0⁢[p]= =G⁢[p]⊆p⁢G0, we have ker⁡φ=S⊕(p⁢A∩ker⁡φ) and so m⁢(φ)=dim⁡S=m.","Lemma 3.6. Let N1,N2,M be the Q⁢T⁢A⁢G-modules and f1,f2 the homomorphisms from N1,N2 onto M such that H1⁢(Ker⁡fi)=0,i=1,2 and Kerf1/(H1(N1)∩ Kerf1)≅Kerf2/(H1(N2)∩Kerf2). Then if ψ is an automorphism of M such that ψ⁢f1⁢(Soc⁡(N1))=f2⁢(Soc⁡(N2)), there exists an isomorphism ϕ:N1→N2 such that f2⁢ϕ=ψ⁢f1

Proof. Let Ker⁡fi=(H1⁢(Ni)∩Ker⁡fi)⊕Li,i=1,2. Now L1≅L2 and being direct summands Li are pure in Ni. Therefore we have Ni=Li⊕Ni′. By Lemma 3.5 when L=0 we may get a map from N1′ to N2′ which gives the required map ϕ:N1→N2 when combined with any isomorphism from L1 to L2.

Lemma 3.7. Let M be a Q⁢T⁢A⁢G-module, m a cardinal number and K a submodule of Soc⁡(M). Then ∃ an epimorphism f:N→M such that H1⁢(Ker⁡f)=0,m⁢(f)=m and Kf=K

Proof. Consider a Q⁢T⁢A⁢G-module M0 such that H1⁢(M0)=M and Soc⁡(M0)= Soc⁡(M). This is possible because M0 is an extension of M with uniserial modules of length one.

Now x+(x0+K)∈Soc⁡(N) if and only if y0∈K. This implies that f⁢(Soc⁡(N))=K.

Again f⁢(x+(x0+K))=0 if and only if y0=0 and Soc⁡(M0)=Soc⁡(M)⊆ H1⁢(M0), which implies that Ker⁡f=L+(H1⁢(N)∩Ker⁡f) and m⁢(f)=g⁢(L)=m.",0209.05701.tex,1250.16007.tex,Paraphrase; Insertions; Text-to-Math; Variation of subject; Deletions; Different Presentation

Then the map which associates to φ the pair (m⁢(φ),P⁢(φ)), where m⁢(φ) is the dimension of kerφ/(pA∩ ∩kerφ) and P⁢(φ)=φ⁢(A⁢[p]), gives a one-to-one correspondence between equivalence classes of elements of ℰG and pairs consisting of a cardinal number and an equivalence class of elements of 𝒫G. Moreover if m⁢(φ1)=m⁢(φ2) and g:P⁢(φ1)≅P⁢(φ2) then g can be lifted to an isomorphism f such that (g,f):φ1≅φ2.

A collection of probability measures Γ⊂𝒫⁢(S) is weakly relatively sequentially compact if and only if cδw⁢(Γ)=0. Proof. The ’only if’-part follows immediately from the definition of cδw⁢(Γ). The ’if’-part however requires a more technical argument and, maybe surprisingly, involves the fact that dT⁢V is a complete metric. Let Γ be a collection of probability measures on S such that cδw⁢(Γ)=0 and consider a sequence (Pn)n in Γ. Choose a subsequence (Pk2⁢(n))n and a probability measure Q2∈𝒫⁢(S) such that

		⩽λδw⁢(Pkp⁢(n)→Qp)+λδw⁢(Pkq⁢(n)→Qq)

Hence, (Qm)m is a dT⁢V-Cauchy sequence. The completeness of dT⁢V allows us to conclude that (Qm)m must converge in total variation to a probability measure P. Now consider the diagonal sequence (Pn′:=Pkn⁢(n))n, which is a subsequence of (Pn)n. We will prove that (Pn′)n converges weakly to P, demonstrating the fact that Γ is weakly relatively sequentially compact. Fix ϵ>0 and choose m such that dT⁢V⁢(P,Qm)<ϵ/2 and 1/m<ϵ/2. Then for each n and α>0 we have the estimate

Since the foregoing inequality holds for all ϵ>0 and α>0, we see that λδw⁢(Pn′→P)=0, which implies the weak convergence of (Pn′)n to P.

We recall that a collection Γ of probability measures on S is said to be tight iff for every ϵ>0 there exists a compact set K⊂S such that for all P∈Γ we have P⁢(S\K)<ϵ. We generalize this notion in two ways. For a collection Γ⊂𝒫⁢(S) we define its weak index of tightness as the number

	
tw⁢(Γ):=sup𝒢⁡inf𝒢0⁡supP∈Γ⁡P⁢(X\⋃𝒢0)
	

where 𝒢 ranges over all open covers of S and 𝒢0 over all finite subcollections of 𝒢. Theorem 4.3. For a metric d metrizing S and Γ⊂𝒫⁢(S) we have

	tw⁢(Γ)	=supδx⁡infK⁡supP∈Γ⁡P⁢(S\⋃x∈KBd⁢(x,δx))	
		=supδx⁡infY⁡supP∈Γ⁡P⁢(S\⋃x∈YBd⁢(x,δx)),	

the first supremum on each line ranging over all choices δx>0,x∈S, the infimum on the first line over all compact sets K in S and on the second line over all finite sets Y in S.

Proof. Let us denote the right-hand side of (29) by j⁢(Γ) and of (30) by b⁢(Γ).tw⁢(Γ)⩽j⁢(Γ) : Fix ϵ>0 and an open cover 𝒢 of S and assume w.l.o.g. that 𝒢 consists of countably many Gn increasing to S. For each x∈S we let nx be the smallest natural number for which x∈Gnx and we choose δx>0 so small that Bd⁢(x,δx)⊂Gnx. Now pick a compact set K in S so that P⁢(S\⋃x∈KB⁢(x,δx))⩽j⁢(Γ)+ϵ for all P∈Γ. Observe that since K is compact, it must be contained in a set Gn0 belonging to 𝒢. Furthermore, for each x∈K we have B⁢(x,δx)⊂Gnx⊂Gn0, by construction of nx. It follows that P⁢(S\Gn0)⩽P⁢(S\⋃x∈KB⁢(x,δx))⩽j⁢(Γ)+ϵ for all P∈Γ. Hence we infer that tw⁢(Γ)⩽j⁢(Γ). j⁢(Γ)⩽b⁢(Γ) : This is trivial. b⁢(Γ)⩽tw⁢(Γ) : Fix ϵ>0,δx>0 for all x∈S and let 𝒢 be the open cover consisting of all balls Bd⁢(x,δx). Since we can pick finitely many xi such that P⁢(S\⋃iBd⁢(xi,δxi))⩽tw⁢(Γ)+ϵ, it easily follows that b⁢(Γ)⩽tw⁢(Γ).

Notice that if (S,d) is a so-called Atsuji or Lebesgue space [3] then it is possible to replace the choice of radii (δy)y in the definition of tw by a fixed choice for all y∈S. Being an Atsuji space means, for instance, that any pair of non-empty

the supremum being taken over all sequences (Pn)n in Γ and the first infimum over all subsequences (Pkn)n. We have the following important theorem. Theorem 5.1. A collection of probability measures Γ⊂𝒫⁢(S) is weakly relatively sequentially compact if and only if cδw⁢(Γ)=0. Proof. The ’only if’-part follows immediately from the definition of cδw⁢(Γ). The ’if’-part however requires a more technical argument and, maybe surprisingly, involves the fact that δw (or equivalently dT⁢V ) is complete. Let Γ be a collection of probability measures on S such that cδw⁢(Γ)=0 and consider a sequence (Pn)n in Γ. Choose a subsequence (Pk2⁢(n))n and a probability measure Q2∈𝒫⁢(S) such that

	
λδw⁢(Pk2⁢(n))⁢(Q2)⩽1/2.
	

Now choose a further subsequence (Pk2∘k3⁢(n))n and a probability measure Q3∈𝒫⁢(S) such that

	
λδw⁢(Pk2∘k3⁢(n))⁢(Q3)⩽1/3.
	

We may continue this procedure ending up for each m⩾2 with a sequence (Pk2∘⋯⁢km⁢(n))n and a probability measure Qm∈𝒫⁢(S) such that

Let us denote the right hand side by b⁢(Γ). tw⁢(Γ)⩽b⁢(Γ) : Fix ϵ>0 and an open cover 𝒢 of S and assume that 𝒢 consists of countably many Gn increasing to S. For each x∈S we let nx be the smallest natural number for which x∈Gnx and we choose δx>0 so small that Bd⁢(x,δx)⊂Gnx. Now pick a finite set Y in S so that P⁢(S\⋃x∈YB⁢(x,δx))⩽b⁢(Γ)+ϵ for all P∈Γ. Observe that since Y is finite, it must be contained in a set Gn0 belonging to 𝒢. Furthermore, for each x∈Y we have B⁢(x,δx)⊂Gnx⊂Gn0, by construction of nx. It follows that P⁢(S\Gn0)⩽P⁢(S\⋃x∈YB⁢(x,δx))⩽b⁢(Γ)+ϵ for all P∈Γ. Hence we infer that tw⁢(Γ)⩽b⁢(Γ). b⁢(Γ)⩽tw⁢(Γ) : Fix ϵ>0,δx>0 for all x∈S and let 𝒢 be the open cover consisting of all balls Bd⁢(x,δx). Since we can pick finitely many xi such that P⁢(S\⋃iBd⁢(xi,δxi))⩽tw⁢(Γ)+ϵ, it easily follows that b⁢(Γ)⩽tw⁢(Γ).

We recall the definition of an Atsuji space. A metric space is called an Atsuji space if any pair of nonempty disjoint closed subsets lie at a strictly positive distance from each other or equivalently if any open cover has a Lebesgue number [1,13] which is why they are also called Lebesgue spaces. Typical extreme examples are a compact space on the one hand and a discrete space, e.g. ℕ, on the other.

Furthermore, (H/(A∩pmG))[p]⊕((pmG)/(A∩pmG))[p]=(G/(A∩pmG)[p]. Since A∩pm⁢G is pure in pm⁢G by Proposition 1.9 and Lemma 2.3, we have ((pm⁢G)/(A∩pm⁢G))⁢[p]=(pm⁢G⁢[p]+(A∩pm⁢G))/(A∩pm⁢G).

First, we prove that H is neat in G. Let p⁢g∈H where g∈G. Since H/(A∩pm⁢G) is neat in G/(A∩pmG⁢G), there exists an element h∈H such that g-h+(A∩pm⁢G)∈(G/(A∩pm⁢G))⁢[p]. Hence g=h+h1+pm⁢g0 a where h1∈H,a∈A∩pm⁢G, and pm⁢g0∈p⁢Gm⁢[p]. Therefore, p⁢g=p⁢(h+h1+a)∈p⁢H, and so H is neat in G. Let x∈G⁢[p]\(A∩pm⁢G), then x=h2+pmx⁢x0+a1 where h2∈H,pm⁢x0∈pm⁢G⁢[p], and a1∈A∩pm⁢G. Since H⊃A,G⁢[p]=H⁢[p]+pm⁢G⁢[p]. Hence H0⁢(G)=Hm⁢(G). On the other hand, we have Dm+n⁢(G,H)≃Dn⁢(pm⁢G,pm⁢G∩H)=Dn⁢(pm⁢G,pm⁢G∩A)=Dm+n⁢(G,A)=0, for all n≥0 by Lemma 2.3.

If PMN⁢(n)=PMN⁢(n+1) for all n⩾k, then N is a semi h-pure submodule of M.

ON SEMI h-PURE SUBMODULES OF QTAG-MODULES 159 Proof: By Remark 2.9 and Proposition 2.10, Qn⁢(M,N)=0 and (Hn+1⁢(M)+N)∩ Soc⁡(Hn⁢(M))=Soc⁡(Hn⁢(M)) for all n⩾k. From the above Theorem, N is a semi h-pure submodule of M.

Let k be a non-negative integer. Suppose that Pn⁢(M,N)=0 for all n⩾k. Then by Proposition 2.10, N satisfies the necessary condition for semi h-pure submodule, namely Qn⁢(M,N)=0 for all n⩾k-1. Furthermore, if k=0, then by Corollary 2.8, N is h-pure in M, and if k=1, then by Theorem 3.5, N is a kernel of h-purity in M. With these statements, we assume that, if k is an integer and Pn⁢(M,N)=0 for all n⩾k, then N is a semi h-pure submodule. Now we prove a theorem which shows that this assumption is true. This is also a sufficient condition for semi h-pure submodules. Theorem 4.3: Let k be a non-negative integer. If Pn⁢(M,N)=0 for all n⩾k, then N is a semi h-pure submodule of M.

Proof: Let us consider the family F={K/K⊇N and K∩Hk(M)=N∩Hk(M)} of submodules of M. By Zorn’s Lemma, F will contain a maximal element, say T, then T/(N∩Hk⁢(M)) is a complement of (Hk⁢(M))/(N∩Hk⁢(M)) in M/(N∩Hk⁢(M)). Therefore,

	
Soc⁡(T/(N∩Hk⁢(M)))⊕Soc⁡((Hk⁢(M))/(N∩Hk⁢(M)))=Soc⁡(M/(N∩Hk⁢(M))).
	

Since N∩Hk⁢(M) is h-pure in Hk⁢(M), by Corollary 2.8 and Lemma 3.3, we get

	
Soc⁡((Hk⁢(M))/(N∩Hk⁢(M)))=(Soc⁡(Hk⁢(M))+(N∩Hk⁢(M)))/(N∩Hk⁢(M)).
	

Now we prove that T is h-neat in M. Let x be a uniform element in T∩H1⁢(M), then there exists a uniform element y∈M such that d⁢(y⁢R/x⁢R)=1. Due to h-neatness of T/(N∩Hk⁢(M)) in M/(N∩Hk⁢(M)) there exists an element z¯∈T/(N∩Hk⁢(M)) such that z¯∈y¯⁢R and d⁢(y¯⁢R/z¯⁢R)=1. Appealing to Lemma 2.3 in [9], we get e⁢(y¯-z¯)⩽1, so y¯-z¯∈Soc⁡(M/(N∩Hk⁢(M))). Hence, y-z=u+v+a, where u∈T,v∈Soc⁡(Hk⁢(M)) and a∈(N∩Hk⁢(M)). This implies that x⁢R=H1⁢(y⁢R)=H1⁢((z+u+v+a)⁢R)⊆H1⁢(T). Therefore, T is h-neat in M. Now for x′∈Soc⁡(M)\(N∩Hk⁢(M)),x′=u′+v′+a′ where u′∈T,v′∈Soc⁡(Hk⁢(M)) and a′∈N∩Hk⁢(M). Since T⊃N and Soc⁡(M)= Soc⁡(T)+Soc⁡(Hk⁢(M)). Hence, PMT⁢(0)=PMT⁢(k). Now by Lemma 3.3, we have

"Definition 2.1. (C.Megibben [6]) A is said to be a kernel of purity in G if all neat hulls of A in G are pure in G. In [6], Megibben has characterized kernels of purity. But, since kernels of purity are purifiable subgroups, it is worth while to give another characterization using our concept of n-th defect. In view of this new characterization, it is immediate that if A is a kernel of purity, then A satisfies Vn⁢(G,A)=0 for almost all n. First, we need the following useful lemmas. Lemma 2.2. If A0⁢(G)=Ak⁢(G)≠Ak+1⁢(G) and Dk+1⁢(G,A)≠0 for some non-negative integer k, then there exists a neat hull of A in G which is not pure in G. Proof.

[3]

In [3], Khan has characterized kernel of h-purity. But, since kernel of h-purity are semi h-pure submodules, so here arise a case to give another characterization, which is given by using the concept of Pn⁢(M,N).

In view of the above discussion, it is trivial that if N is a kernel of h-purity, then N satisfies Qn⁢(M,N)=0 for almost all n. First, we need the following useful Lemmas. Lemma 3.2: If PMN⁢(0)=PMN⁢(k)≠PMN⁢(k+1) and Pk+1⁢(M,N)≠0 for some nonnegative integer k, then there exists a h-neat hull of N in M which is not h-pure in M. Proof: Since PMN⁢(0)=PMN⁢(k)≠PMN⁢(k+1), then there exists x∈Soc⁡(M) such that x∉Soc⁡(Hk+1⁢(M))+Soc⁡(N). Since Pk+1⁢(M,N)≠0, then we get an element y¯∈PNM⁢(k+1) such that y¯∉PMN⁢(k+1), where y∈Hk+1⁢(M) and there exists an element z∈M such that d⁢(z⁢R/y⁢R)=k+1. Let us define K=(x+y)⁢R+N. Now we have to show that Soc⁡(K)=Soc⁡(N). Suppose on contrary Soc⁡(K)≠Soc⁡(N). For any (x+y)⁢r+a∈Soc⁡(K), where r∈R and a∈N, either x⁢r⁢R=x⁢R or x⁢r=0. If x⁢r=0, then y⁢r+a∈Soc⁡(M). Now by hypothesis, y¯∈PMN⁢(0)=PMN⁢(k). Appealing to Theorem 4.3 in [6], we know that all h-neat hulls of N are not h-pure in M if Qk⁢(M,N)≠0. Therefore, we assume that Qk⁢(M,N)=0. Using Proposition 2.10, we get y¯∈PMN⁢(k+1), which shows a contradiction. Hence, Soc⁡(K)=Soc⁡(N). Now, let T be a h-neat hull of N in M such that K⊆T, and so y¯∈PTM⁢(k+1). If we suppose that y¯∈PMT⁢(k+1), then y=u+v, for some u∈Soc⁡(Hk+1⁢(M)) and v∈T. Therefore, x=y+x-(u+v) and y+x-v∈Soc⁡(T)=Soc⁡(N). Hence, x∈Soc⁡(Hk+1⁢(M))+Soc⁡(N), which shows a contradiction.

Since N/(K∩T) is finitely generated, so N=(K∩T)⊕L, where L is finitely generated.

Proof: Let x1,⋯,xn∈M. Since M/K is almost locally h-pure, there exists a finitely generated h-pure submodule L/K of M/K which contains x1+K,⋯,xn+K. Since K is h-pure and L/K is finitely generated, L=K⊕N, where N is finitely generated. Now xi∈L for i=1,⋯,n. Let xi=yi+zi for yi∈K and zi∈N. Since K is almost locally h-pure, let P be a finitely generated h-pure submodule of K which contains yi′⁢s. Now xi∈P⊕N and P⊕N is h-pure in L, which is h-pure in M. Hence, P⊕N is a finitely generated h-pure submodule of M, which contains xi′⁢s. Hence, M is almost locally h-pure.

Theorem 2.9: Every QTAG-module M has a maximal almost locally h-pure submodule N (which may be 0 ) and 0 is the only almost locally h-pure submodule of M/N

Proof: Using Zorn’s lemma, we establish the existence of a maximal almost locally h-pure submodule N of M. If K/N were a non-zero almost locally h-pure submodule of M/N, then K would be a h-pure submodule of M and by Theorem 2.8,K would be almost locally h-pure, which contradicts the maximality of N. Hence, 0 is the only almost locally h-pure submodule of M/N.

Corollary 2.10: If M is a QTAG-module and N is a maximal almost locally h-pure submodule of M, then M/N is h-divisible.

Proof: Suppose that M/N is not h-divisible, then by Theorem 4 in [3], M/N=K/N⊕L/N, with K/N is h-divisible and L/N is h-reduced and L/N has a submodule P/N, which is a summand of L/N and bounded uniserial module. Therefore, P/N is a almost locally h-pure submodule of M/N, contradicting the maximality of N.

Guendouzi Laboratory of Mathematics, Djillali Liabes University P.O.Box 89, 22000 Sidi Bel Abbes, Algeria tf.guendouzi@gmail.com Abstract In this paper we study the correlation inequality in the Wiener space using the Malliavin and the fractional calculus. Under positivity and monotonicity conditions, we give a proof of the positive correlation between two random functionals F and G which are assumed smooth enough. The main argument is the Itô-Clark representation formula for the functionals of a fractional Brownian motion. Mathematics Subject Classifications: 60E15, 60F15, 60G05, 60G10, 60H07, 60J60

Keywords: Wiener space, Positive correlations, Malliavin calculus, Clark formula, FKG inequality, Fractional Brownian motion 1 Introduction It is well-known that the correlations inequalities are one of the most powerful tools of the stochastic analysis due to its vast range of applications. So, The theoretical study of these inequalities has matured tremendously since the seminal work of Fortuin, Kasteleyn and Ginibre [5]. In general, several authors have been interested in finding applications of these inequalities in some areas including statistical mechanics (see, for instance, Bakry and Michel [1], Preston [15]).

Recently, Mayer-Wolf, Üstünel, Zakai obtained general covariance inequalities in an abstract Wiener space, they consider such inequalities for functionals satisfying either monotonicity or convexity properties [13]. Hence Houdré and the second author in [9] used Malliavin calculus techniques to obtain covariance identities and inequalities for functionals of the Wiener and the Poisson processes.

3194 T. Guendouzi The purpose of this paper is to use the Malliavin calculus techniques to study the positive correlations between two functionals on the Wiener space via fractional calculus. Our proofs rely in general on the Itô-Clark representation formula for the functionals of a fractional Brownian motion and the monotonicity condition for F and G on the Wiener space. Here, the fractional Brownian motion of index H∈(0,1) is the centred Gaussian process whose covariance kernel is given by

	
RH⁢(s,t)=𝔼H⁢[WsH⁢WtH],
	

and for f given in [a,b], each of the expressions

	
(Da+α⁢f)⁢(x)=(dd⁢x)[α]+1⁢Ia+1-{α}⁢f⁢(x),(Db-α⁢f)⁢(x)=(-dd⁢x)[α]+1⁢Ib-1-{α}⁢f⁢(x),
	

are respectively called right and left fractional derivative where [α] denotes the integer part of α,{α}=α-[α] and (Ia+α⁢f⁢(x))⁢(x),(Ib-α⁢f⁢(x))⁢(x) are right and left fractional integral of the order α>0 (see [3] ). Hence for H∈(0,1) the integral transform KH⁢f is defined as

	
KH⁢f=I0+2⁢H⁢x1/2-H⁢I0+1/2-H⁢xH-1/2⁢f,	H≤1/2	
KH⁢f=I0+1⁢xH-1/2⁢I0+H-1/2⁢x1/2-H⁢f,	H≥1/2	
	

KH is an isomorphism from L2⁢([0,1]) onto I0+H+1/2⁢(L2⁢([0,1])). If H≥1/2, r→KH⁢(t,r) is continuous on (0,t].

The organization of this paper is as follows: in Section 2, we shall give some preparation and state main results. we begin by recalling the basic notions of Malliavin calculus, the gradient operator and Sobolev-type space 𝒟2,1, the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck semigroup, the Itô-Clark representation formula for functional of Brownian motion. In section 3, we shall study the positive correlation between two functionals of the Wiener space satisfying monotonicity property. 2 Preliminaries This section gives some basic notions of analysis on the Wiener space (W,ℱH,ℙH). The reader can consult [14] for a complete survey on this topic. Let W represented as C0⁢([0,1],ℝ) of continuous function ω:[0,1]⟶ℝ with w⁢(0)=0, equipped with the ∥.∥∞-norm i.e W is also a (separable) Banach-space, W* be its topological dual and (Wt)t∈[0,1] be a canonical Brownian motion generating the filtration (ℱtH)t∈[0,1]. Random-variables on W are called Wiener functionals and the coordinate process ω⁢(t) is a Brownian motion under PH. So we

Positive correlations in Wiener space 3195 write ω⁢(t)=W⁢(t,ω)=W⁢(t). Recall that ℙH is the unique probability measure on W such that the canonical process (W⁢(t))t∈R is a centered Gaussian process with the covariance Kernel RH :

	
𝔼H⁢[W⁢(t)⁢W⁢(s)]=RH⁢(t,s).
	

The Cameron-Martin space ℋH is an subspace of W defined as

	
ℋH={KH⁢h˙;h˙∈L2⁢([0,1],d⁢t)}
	

i.e, any h∈ℋH can be represented as h⁢(t)=KH⁢h˙⁢(t)=∫01KH⁢(s,t)⁢h˙⁢(s)⁢𝑑s, h˙ belongs to L2⁢([0,1]). The scalar product on the space ℋH is given by (h,g)ℋH=(KH⁢h˙,KH⁢g˙)ℋH=(h˙,g˙)L2⁢([0,1]) We note that for any H∈(0,1),RH⁢(t,s) can be written as

	
RH⁢(t,s)=∫01KH⁢(t,r)⁢KH⁢(s,r)⁢𝑑r
	

and RH=KH⁢KH*, where KH is the Hilbert-Schmidt operator introduced in the first section. RH is also the injection from W* into the space ℋH and it can be decomposed as RH⁢η=KH⁢(KH*⁢η), for any η in W* (see, [18]). The restriction of KH* to W* is the injection from W* into L2⁢([0,1]).

If y is an ℋH-valued random variable, we denote by y˙ the L2⁢([0,1],ℝ)-valued random variable such that y⁢(ω,t)=∫0tKH⁢(t,s)⁢y˙⁢(ω,s)⁢𝑑s. Here, for F∈𝒮⁢(χ) the H-Gross-Sobolev derivative of F, denoted by ∇⁡F and is the ℋH⊗χ-valued mapping defined by

	
∇⁡F⁢(ω)=∑i=1n∂⁡f∂⁡xi⁢(⟨l1,ω⟩,…,⟨ln,ω⟩)⁢RH⁢(li)⊗x
	

where χ be a separable Hilbert space, 𝒮⁢(χ) is the set of χ-valued smooth cylindric functionals, and for each 1≤i≤n,li is in W* and xi belongs to χ. Hence, for any RH⁢η∈ℋH we have by the Cameron-Martin theorem

	
𝔼H⁢[F⁢(ω+RH⁢η)]=∫F⁢(ω)⁢exp⁡(⟨η,ω⟩-∥RH⁢η∥ℋH2/2)⁢𝑑ℙH⁢(ω).
	

The Ornstein-Uhlenbeck semigroup {TtH,t≥0} of bounded operators wich acts on Lp⁢(ℙH,χ) for any p≥1 can be described by the Mehler formula:

	
(TtH⁢F)⁢(ω)=∫WF⁢(e-t⁢ω+1-e-2⁢t⁢ω′)⁢ℙH⁢(d⁢ω′).
	




3196 T. Guendouzi The directional derivative of F∈𝒮⁢(χ) in the the direction RH⁢η∈ℋH is given by

	
(∇F,RHη)ℋH=dd⁢tF(ω+t.RHη)|t=0
	

and from (2) we have ∇⁡F depends only on the equivalence classes with respect to ℙH and 𝔼H⁢((∇⁡F,RH⁢η)ℋH)=𝔼H⁢(F⁢⟨ω,η⟩)

For any p≥1 we define Sobolev space 𝒟p,kH⁢(χ),k∈𝐙, as the completion of 𝒮⁢(χ) with respect to the norm

	
∥F∥p,k,H=∥F∥LHp+∥∇k⁡F∥Lp⁢(PH;χ),
	

hence the operator ∇ can be extended as continuous linear operator from 𝒟p,kH⁢(χ) to 𝒟p,k-1H⁢(ℋH⊗χ) for any p>1 and k∈𝐙 (see,[18]). Thus ∇ : 𝒟p,kH⁢(χ)→𝒟p,k-1H⁢(ℋH⊗χ); its formal adjoint with respect to ℙH is the operator δH in the sense that ∀F∈𝒮,∀y∈𝒮⁢(ℋH),𝔼H⁢[F⁢δH⁢y]=𝔼H⁢[(∇⁡F,y)ℋH], and since ∇ has continuous extensions, δH has also a continuous linear extension from 𝒟p,kH⁢(ℋH) to 𝒟p,k-1H for any p>1 and k∈ℕ Recall the following, unique, Wiener-Itô chaos expansion for all ℙH-s⁢q⁢u⁢a⁢r⁢e integrable functionl F from W to ℝ

	
F=𝔼⁢F+∑1∞JnH⁢F,
	

where JnH is the n-fold iterated Itô integrale of F. If y∈ℋH and ϑ1y= exp⁡(δH⁢y-1/2⁢∥y∥ℋH2), then we have

	
JnH⁢ϑ1y=1n!⁢δH(n)⁢y⊗n
	

More precisely, if F∈∪k∈𝐙𝒟2,kH

	
JnH⁢F=1n!⁢δH(n)⁢(𝔼H⁢∇(n)⁡F).
	

For H∈(0,1), let {πtH;t∈[0,1]} be the family of orthogonal projection in ℋH defined by

	
πtH⁢(KH⁢y)=KH⁢(y⁢𝟏[0,1]),y∈L2⁢([0,1]).
	

The operator Υ⁢(πtH) is the second quantization of πtH from L2⁢(ℙH) into itself defined by

	
F=∑n≥0δH(n)⁢fn↦Υ⁢πtH⁢(F)=∑n≥0δH(n)⁢((πtH)⊗n⁢fn)
	




Positive correlations in Wiener space 3197 Thus we have, for y∈ℋH,

	
Υ⁢(πtH)⁢(ϑ1y)=exp⁡(δH⁢(πtH⁢y)-1/2⁢∥πtH⁢y∥ℋH2)=ϑ1y
	

hence the bijectivity of the operator KH has the following consequence

	
ℱtH=σ⁢{δH⁢(πtH⁢y),y∈ℋH}∨𝒩H
	

where 𝒩H is the set of the ℙH-negligible events. We also note that for any F∈L2⁢(ℙH)

	
Υ⁢(πtH)⁢F=𝔼H⁢[F∣ℱtH],
	

and in particular

	
𝔼H⁢[Wt∣ℱtH]=∫0tKH⁢(t,s)⁢𝟏[0,1]⁢(s)⁢δH⁢Ws
𝔼H⁢[exp⁡(δH⁢y-1/2⁢∥y∥ℋH2)∣ℱtH]=exp⁡(δH⁢(πtH⁢y)-1/2⁢∥πtH⁢y∥ℋH2),
	

for any y∈ℋH We shall recall the following results Theorem 2.1 ([3]) Let F be 𝒟2,1H. Then F belons to ℱtH iff ∇⁡F=πtH⁢∇⁡F. Theorem 2.2 (Itô-Clark representation formula) For any F∈𝒟2,1H,

	F-𝔼H⁢[F]	=∫01𝔼H⁢[KH-1⁢(∇⁡F)⁢(s)∣ℱsH]⁢δH⁢Ws	
		=δH(KH(𝔼H[KH-1(∇F)(.)∣ℱ.]))	

3 Monotonicity and positive correlations In this section we prepare the basic tools. Our method relies on the Itô-Clark formula which plays an crucial role to establish positive correlation between two random functionals under some hypotheses. Thus we recall here the following correlation identity, in the first lemma, which is based on the Clark formula and the Itô isometry. we refer to [3] and [9] for tutorial references on this identity. Lemma 3.1 For any F,G∈L2⁢(ℙH) we have

	
Cov⁡(F,G)=𝔼H⁢[∫01𝔼H⁢[KH-1⁢(∇⁡F)⁢(s)∣ℱsH]⁢𝔼H⁢[KH-1⁢(∇⁡G)⁢(s)∣ℱsH]⁢𝑑s]
	




3198 T. Guendouzi Proof. We have

	Cov⁡(F,G)	=𝔼H⁢[(F-𝔼H⁢[F])⁢(G-𝔼H⁢[G])]	
		=𝔼H⁢[∫01𝔼H⁢[KH-1⁢(∇⁡F)⁢(s)∣ℱsH]⁢δH⁢Ws⁢∫01𝔼H⁢[KH-1⁢(∇⁡G)⁢(s)∣ℱsH]⁢δH⁢Ws]	
		=𝔼H⁢[∫01𝔼H⁢[KH-1⁢(∇⁡F)⁢(s)∣ℱsH]⁢𝔼H⁢[KH-1⁢(∇⁡G)⁢(s)∣ℱsH]⁢𝑑s]	

Proposition 3.2 Let G be a ℱtH-measurable element of 𝒟2,1H. Then the identity (9) can be written as

	Cov⁡(F,G)	=𝔼H⁢[∫01𝔼H⁢[KH-1⁢(∇⁡F)⁢(s)∣ℱsH]⁢KH-1⁢(∇⁡G)⁢(s)⁢𝑑s]	
		=𝔼H⁢[∫01𝔼H⁢[KH-1⁢(∇⁡F)⁢(s)∣ℱsH]⁢KH-1⁢(πtH⁢∇⁡G)⁢(s)⁢𝑑s]	

The next result is an immediate consequence of (9). Lemma 3.3 Let F,G∈L2⁢(ℙH) such that

	
𝔼H⁢[KH-1⁢(∇⁡F)⁢(s)∣ℱsH]⁢𝔼H⁢[KH-1⁢(∇⁡G)⁢(s)∣ℱsH]≥0,d⁢s×d⁢ℙ- a.s. 
	

Then F and G are positively correlated and we have Cov⁡(F,G)≥0. The main results of this section is the following: Corollary 3.4 If F,G∈𝒟2,1H satisfy KH-1⁢[∇⁡F]⁢(t)≥0,KH-1⁢[∇⁡G]⁢(t)≥0⁢a.s. , then F and G are positively correlated.

Corollary 3.5 If G∈𝒟2,1H, and if 𝔼H[KH-1(∇F)(s)∣ℱsH]≥0,KH-1[∇G](t)≥ 0a.s., then F and G are positively correlated.

The next lemma studies the positivity of KH-1⁢[∇⁡F]⁢(t), for any functional F∈𝒟2,1H under the monotonicity assumption. Lemma 3.6 For any increasing functional F∈𝒟2,1H we have

	
KH-1⁢[∇⁡F]⁢(t)≥0,d⁢t×d⁢ℙH- a.s. 
	

Proof. Let F be increasing functional i.e. F(.+y)≥F(.)a.s.,forall y∈ℋH and {unt,n≥0} be an orthonormal basis of £2⁢([0,1]), for H∈ (0,1),𝒱nt be the σ field generated by {δH⁢KH⁢uit,i≤n}. Since ∨n𝒱nt=ℱtH, the sequence Fn=𝔼H⁢[F/𝒱nt] converge to F in 𝒟2,1H, and from πtH⁢KH⁢unt= KH⁢unt, for Fn we have ∇⁡Fn=πtH⁢∇⁡Fn and ∇⁡F=πtH⁢∇⁡F follows. Hence, by

Positive correlations in Wiener space 3199 the Cameron-Martin formula (2) we have for any 𝒱nt-measurable and squareintegrable random variable ϑnt,

	𝔼H⁢[Fn⁢(ω+ynt)]	=𝔼H⁢[exp⁡(δH⁢ynt-1/2⁢∥ynt∥ℋH2)⁢Fn⁢(ω)]	
		=𝔼H⁢[ϑnt⁢Fn⁢(ω)]	
		=𝔼H⁢[ϑnt⁢𝔼H⁢[F/𝒱nt]⁢(ω)]	
		=𝔼H⁢[𝔼H⁢[ϑnt⁢F/𝒱nt]⁢(ω)]	
		=𝔼H⁢[ϑnt⁢F⁢(ω)]	
		=𝔼H⁢[F⁢(ω+ynt)]	

On the other hand, for any square-integrable function f on [0,1]n we have

	Fn⁢(ω+y)	=Fn⁢(ω+yt)	
		=f⁢(δH⁢KH⁢u0t+(KH⁢u0t,KH-1⁢yt)L2⁢([0,1]),…,δH⁢KH⁢unt+(KH⁢unt,KH-1⁢yt)L2⁢([0,1]))	
		=f⁢(δH⁢KH⁢u0t+(KH⁢u0t,πtH⁢KH-1⁢ynt)L2⁢([0,1]),…,δH⁢KH⁢unt+(KH⁢unt,πtH⁢KH-1⁢ynt)L2⁢([0,1]))	
		=Fn⁢(ω+ynt)	
		=𝐄H⁢[F⁢(ω+ynt)/𝒱nt]	
		≥𝐄H⁢[F/𝒱nt]⁢(ω)	
		=Fn⁢(ω)-a.s.	

Thus, we conclude that the smooth function Fn⁢(ω+τ⁢y) is increasing in τ, for any τ∈ℝ where πtH⁢KH-1⁢ynt=KH-1⁢ynt is positive, hence we have from (4) that (∇⁡Fn,KH-1⁢y)L2⁢([0,1]) is positive. Since ∇⁡Fn is positive and ∇⁡Fn→∇⁡F then ∇⁡F is also positive. To complete the proof, it suffices to use the fact that δH⁢(πtH⁢∇⁡F)=∫0tKH-1⁢[∇⁡F]⁢(s)⁢δH⁢Ws and ∇⁡F positive we get KH-1⁢[∇⁡F]⁢(s)≥0, a.s. Lemma 3.7 For any increasing functional F∈L2⁢(ℙH) we have

	
𝔼H⁢[KH-1⁢(∇⁡F)⁢(s)∣ℱsH]≥0,d⁢t×d⁢ℙH- a.s. 
	

Proof. Let {TtH,t≥0} be a semigroup defined as in (3), and assume that F is increasing functional in L2⁢(ℙH). Taking t=1/n,∀n≥1, we have T1/nH⁢F is also increasing from (3) and element of 𝒟2,1H. Hence from lemma 3.6,∇⁡T1/nH⁢F is positive and also KH-1⁢[∇⁡T1/nH⁢F]⁢(s)≥0, a.s., then 𝔼H⁢[KH-1⁢(∇⁡T1/nH⁢F)⁢(t)∣ℱtH] follows. Finally, using the fact that T1/nH⁢F→F as n goes to infinity we get the result.

Box 89, 22000 Sidi Bel Abbes, Algeria email: tf .guendouzi@gmail.com Abstract. In this paper we study the correlation inequality in the Wiener space using the Malliavin and the fractional calculus. Under positivity and monotonicity conditions, we give a proof of the positive correlation between two random functionals F and G which are assumed smooth enough. The main argument is the Itô-Clark representation formula for the functionals of a fractional Brownian motion. 1 Introduction It is well-known that the correlations inequalities are one of the most powerful tools of the stochastic analysis due to its vast range of applications. So, The theoretical study of these inequalities has matured tremendously since the seminal work of Fortuin, Kasteleyn and Ginibre [5]. In general, several authors have been interested in finding applications of these inequalities in some areas including statistical mechanics (see, for instance, Bakry and Michel [1], Preston [15]).

Recently, Mayer-Wolf, Üstünel and Zakai obtained general covariance inequalities in an abstract Wiener space. They consider such inequalities for functionals satisfying either monotonicity or convexity properties [13]. Hence Houdré and Perez-Abreu in [9] used Malliavin calculus techniques to obtain 2010 Mathematics Subject Classification: 60E15, 60F15, 60G05, 60G10, 60H07, 60J60 Key words and phrases: Wiener space, positive correlations, Malliavin calculus, Clark formula, FKG inequality, fractional Brownian motion

Positive correlation 207 covariance identities and inequalities for functionals of the Wiener and the Poisson processes.

The purpose of this paper is to use the Malliavin calculus techniques to study the positive correlations between two functionals on the Wiener space via fractional calculus. Our proofs rely in general on the Itô-Clark representation formula for the functionals of a fractional Brownian motion and the monotonicity condition for F and G on the Wiener space. Here, the fractional Brownian motion of index H∈(0,1) is the centred Gaussian process whose covariance kernel is given by

	
RH⁢(s,t)=𝔼H⁢[WsH⁢WtH],
	

and for f given in [a,b], each of the expressions

	
(Da+α⁢f)⁢(x)=(dd⁢x)[α]+1⁢Ia+1-{α}⁢f⁢(x),(Db-α⁢f)⁢(x)=(-dd⁢x)[α]+1⁢Ib-1-{α}⁢f⁢(x),
	

are respectively called right and left fractional derivative where [α] denotes the integer part of α,{α}=α-[α] and (Ia+α⁢f⁢(x))⁢(x),(Ib-α⁢f⁢(x))⁢(x) are right and left fractional integral of the order α>0 (see [3]). Hence for H∈(0,1) the integral transform KH⁢f is defined as

	
KH⁢f	=I0+2⁢Z1/2-⁢II+1/2-Hχ⁢H-1/2⁢f,	H≤1/2
KHf=I0+1⁢χH-1/2⁢I0+H-1/2⁢χ1/2-Hf,	H≥1/2	
	

KH is an isomorphism from L2⁢([0,1]) onto I0+H+1/2⁢(L2⁢([0,1])). If H≥1/2, r→KH⁢(t,r) is continuous on (0,t].

The organization of this paper is as follows: in Section 2, we shall give some preparation and state main results. We begin by recalling the basic notions of Malliavin calculus, the gradient operator and Sobolev-type space 𝒟2,1, the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck semigroup, the Itô-Clark representation formula for functional of Brownian motion. In Section 3, we shall study the positive correlation between two functionals of the Wiener space satisfying monotonicity property. 2 Preliminaries This section gives some basic notions of analysis on the Wiener space (W,ℱH, ℙ𝐇). The reader can consult [14] for a complete survey on this topic. Let W represented as C0⁢([0,1],ℝ) of continuous function ω:[0,1]⟶ℝ with

208 T. Guendouzi w⁢(0)=0, equipped with the ∥.∥∞-norm i.e W is also a (separable) Banachspace, W* is its topological dual and (W𝐭)𝐭∈[0,1] be a canonical Brownian motion generating the filtration (ℱtH)𝐭∈[0,1]. Random-variables on W are called Wiener functionals and the coordinate process ω⁢(t) is a Brownian motion under PH. So we write ω⁢(t)=W⁢(t,ω)=W⁢(t). Recall that PH is the unique probability measure on W such that the canonical process (W⁢(t))t∈ℝ is a centered Gaussian process with the covariance Kernel RH :

	
𝔼H⁢[W⁢(t)⁢W⁢(s)]=RH⁢(t,s).
	

The Cameron-Martin space ℋH is an subspace of W defined as

	
ℋH={KH⁢h˙;h˙∈L2⁢([0,1],dt)}
	

i.e, any h∈ℋH can be represented as h⁢(t)=KH⁢h˙⁢(t)=∫01KH⁢(s,t)⁢h˙⁢(s)⁢𝑑s, h˙ belongs to L2⁢([0,1]). The scalar product on the space ℋH is given by (h,g)ℋH=(KH⁢h˙,KH⁢g˙)ℋH=(h˙,g˙)L2⁢([0,1]). We note that for any H∈(0,1),RH⁢(t,s) can be written as

	
RH⁢(t,s)=∫01KH⁢(t,r)⁢KH⁢(s,r)⁢𝑑r
	

and RH=KH⁢KH*, where KH is the Hilbert-Schmidt operator introduced in the first section. RH is also the injection from W* into the space ℋH and it can be decomposed as RH⁢η=KH⁢(KH*⁢η), for any η in W* (see, [18]). The restriction of KH* to W* is the injection from W* into L2⁢([0,1]). random variable such that y⁢(ω,t)=∫0tKH⁢(t,s)⁢y˙⁢(ω,s) ds. Here, for F∈𝒮⁢(χ) the H-Gross-Sobolev derivative of F, denoted by ∇⁡F and is the ℋH⊗χ-valued mapping defined by

	
∇⁡F⁢(ω)=∑i=1n∂⁡f∂⁡xi⁢(⟨l1,ω⟩,…,⟨ln,ω⟩)⁢RH⁢(li)⊗x,
	

where χ is a separable Hilbert space, 𝒮⁢(χ) is the set of χ-valued smooth cylindric functionals, and for each 1≤i≤n,li is in W* and xi belongs to χ. Hence, for any RH⁢η∈ℋH we have by the Cameron-Martin theorem

	
𝔼H⁢[F⁢(ω+RH⁢η)]=∫F⁢(ω)⁢exp⁡(⟨η,ω⟩-∥RH⁢η∥ℋH2/2)⁢𝑑ℙH⁢(ω).
	




Positive correlation 209 The Ornstein-Uhlenbeck semigroup {TtH,t≥0} of bounded operators which acts on Lp⁢(ℙH,χ) for any p≥1 can be described by the Mehler formula:

	
(TtH⁢F)⁢(ω)=∫WF⁢(e-t⁢ω+1-e-2⁢t⁢ω′)⁢ℙH⁢(d⁢ω′).
	

The directional derivative of F∈𝒮⁢(χ) in the the direction RH⁢η∈ℋH is given by

	
(∇F,RHη)ℋH=dd⁢tF(ω+t.RHη)|t=0′
	

and from (2) we have ∇⁡F depends only on the equivalence classes with respect to ℙH and 𝔼H⁢((∇⁡F,RH⁢η)ℋH)=𝔼H⁢(F⁢⟨ω,η⟩).

For any p≥1 we define Sobolev space 𝒟p,kH⁢(χ),k∈ℤ, as the completion of 𝒮⁢(χ) with respect to the norm

	
∥F∥p,k,H=∥F∥LHp+∥∇k⁡F∥Lp⁢(ℙH;χ),
	

hence the operator ∇ can be extended as continuous linear operator from 𝒟p,kH⁢(χ) to 𝒟p,k-1H(ℋH⊗χ ) for any p>1 and k∈ℤ (see [18]). Thus ∇:𝒟p,kH⁢(χ)→𝒟p,k-1H⁢(ℋ𝐇⊗χ); its formal adjoint with respect to ℙH is the operator δH in the sense that ∀F∈𝒮,∀y∈𝒮⁢(ℋH),𝔼H⁢[F⁢δH⁢y]=𝔼H⁢[(∇⁡F,y)ℋH], and since ∇ has continuous extensions, δH has also a continuous linear extension from 𝒟p,kH⁢(ℋH) to 𝒟p,k-1H for any p>1 and k∈ℕ.

Recall the following, unique, Wiener-Itô chaos expansion for all ℙH-square integrable functional F from W to ℝ

	
F=𝔼⁢𝔽+∑1∞JnH⁢F,
	

where J𝔫H is the n-fold iterated Itô integral of F. If y∈ℋH and ϑ1y=exp(δH⁢y𝐲 1/2∥y∥ℋH2), then we have

	
JnHH⁢ϑ1y=1n!⁢δH(n)⁢y⊗n
	

More precisely, if F∈∪k∈ℤ𝒟2,kH,

	
JnH⁢F=1n!⁢δH(𝔫)⁢(𝔼H⁢∇(n)⁡F).
	




210 T. Guendouzi For H∈(0,1), let {πtH;t∈[0,1]} be the family of orthogonal projection in ℋH defined by

	
πtH⁢(KH⁢y)=KH⁢(y⁢1[0,1]),y∈L2⁢([0,1]).
	

The operator γ⁢(πtH) is the second quantization of πtH from L2⁢(ℙH) into itself defined by

	
F=∑n≥0δH(n)⁢fn↦γtH⁢(F)=∑n≥0δH(n)⁢((πtH)⊗nf⁢fn).
	

Thus we have, for y∈ℋH,

	
γ⁢(πtH)⁢(ϑ1y)=exp⁡(δH⁢(πtH⁢y)-1/2⁢∥πtH⁢y∥ℋH2)=ϑ1y,
	

hence the bijectivity of the operator KH has the following consequence

	
ℱtH=σ⁢{δH⁢(πtH⁢y),y∈ℋH}∨𝒩H,
	

where 𝒩H is the set of the ℙH-negligible events. We also note that for any F∈L2⁢(ℙH),

	
Υ⁢(πtH)⁢F=𝔼H⁢[F∣ℱtH],
	

and in particular

	
𝔼H⁢[Wt∣ℱtH]=∫0tKH⁢(t,s)⁢𝟏[0,1]⁢(s)⁢δH⁢Ws
𝔼H⁢[exp⁡(δH⁢y-1/2⁢∥y∥ℋH2)∣ℱtH]=exp⁡(δH⁢(πtH⁢y)-1/2⁢∥πtH⁢y∥ℋH2)
	

for any y∈ℋH. We shall recall the following results Theorem 1 ([3]) Let F be 𝒟2,1H. Then F belongs to ℱtH iff ∇⁡F=πtH⁢∇⁡F. Theorem 2 (Itô-Clark representation formula) For any F∈𝒟2,1H,

	F-𝔼H⁢[F]	=∫01𝔼H⁢[KH-1⁢(∇⁡F)⁢(s)∣ℱsH]⁢δH⁢Ws	
		=δH(KH(𝔼H[KH-1(∇F)(.)∣ℱ])).	




Positive correlation 211 3 Monotonicity and positive correlations Our method relies on the Itô-Clark formula which plays a crucial role to establish positive correlation between two random functionals under some hypotheses. Thus we recall here the following correlation identity, in the first lemma, which is based on the Clark formula and the Itô isometry. We refer to [3] and [9] for tutorial references on this identity. Lemma 1 For any F,G∈L2⁢(ℙH) we have

	
Cov⁡(F,G)=𝔼H⁢[∫01𝔼H⁢[KH-1⁢(∇⁡F)⁢(s)∣ℱsH]⁢𝔼H⁢[KH-1⁢(∇⁡G)⁢(s)∣ℱsH]⁢ds].
	

Proof. We have

	cov⁡(F,G)	=𝔼H⁢[(F-𝔼H⁢[F])⁢(G-𝔼H⁢[G])]	
		=𝔼H⁢[∫01𝔼H⁢[KH-1⁢(∇⁡F)⁢(s)∣ℱsH]⁢δH⁢Ws⁢∫01𝔼H⁢[KH-1⁢(∇⁡G)⁢(s)∣ℱsH]⁢δH⁢Ws]	
		=𝔼H⁢[∫01𝔼H⁢[KH-1⁢(∇⁡F)⁢(s)∣ℱsH]⁢𝔼H⁢[KH-1⁢(∇⁡G)⁢(s)∣ℱsH]⁢ds]	

Proposition 1 Let G be a ℱtH-measurable element of 𝒟2,1H. Then the identity (9) can be written as

	Cov⁡(F,G)	=𝔼H⁢[∫O1𝔼H⁢[KH-1⁢(∇⁡F)⁢(s)∣ℱsH]⁢KH-1⁢(∇⁡G)⁢(s)⁢ds]	
		=𝔼H⁢[∫01𝔼H⁢[KH-1⁢(∇⁡F)⁢(s)∣ℱsHH]⁢KH-1⁢(πtH⁢∇⁡G)⁢(s)⁢ds].	

The next result is an immediate consequence of (9). Lemma 2 Let F,G∈L2⁢(ℙH) such that

	
𝔼H⁢[KH-1⁢(∇⁡F)⁢(s)∣ℱsH]⁢𝔼H⁢[KH-1⁢(∇⁡G)⁢(s)∣ℱsH]≥0, ds ×dP- a.s. 
	

Then F and G are positively correlated and we have Cov⁡(F,G)≥0. The main results of this section are the following: Corollary 1 If F,G∈𝒟2,1H satisfy KH-1⁢[∇⁡F]⁢(t)≥0,KH-1⁢[∇⁡G]⁢(t)≥0 a.s., then F and G are positively correlated.

212 T. Guendouzi Corollary 2 If G∈𝒟2,1H, and if 𝔼H[KH-1(∇F)(s)∣ℱsH]≥0,KH-1[∇G](t)≥ Oa.s., then F and G are positively correlated.

The next theorem studies the positivity of KH-1⁢[∇⁡F]⁢(t), for any functional F∈𝒟2,1H under the monotonicity assumption. Theorem 3 For any increasing functional F∈𝒟2,1H we have

	
KH-1⁢[∇⁡F]⁢(t)≥0,dt×d⁢ℙH- a.s. 
	

Proof. Let F be increasing functional i.e. F(.+y)≥F(.) a.s., for all y∈ℋH and {unt,n≥0} be an orthonormal basis of Ł2⁢([0,1]), for H∈(0,1),𝒱nt be the σ field generated by {δH⁢KH⁢uit,i≤n}. Since ∨n𝒱nt=ℱtH, the sequence Fn=𝔼H⁢[F/𝒱nt] converge to F in 𝒟2,1H, and from πtH⁢KH⁢unt=KH⁢unt, for Fn we have ∇⁡Fn=πtH⁢∇⁡Fn and ∇⁡F=πtH⁢∇⁡F follows. Hence, by the Cameron-Martin formula (2) we have for any 𝒱nt-measurable and square-integrable random variable ϑnt,

	𝔼H⁢[Fn⁢(ω+ynt)]	=𝔼H⁢[exp⁡(δH⁢ynt-1/2⁢∥ynt∥ℋH2)⁢Fn⁢(ω)]	
		=𝔼H⁢[ϑnt⁢Fn⁢(ω)]	
		=𝔼H⁢[ϑnt⁢𝔼H⁢[F/𝒱nt]⁢(ω)]	
		=𝔼H⁢[𝔼H⁢[ϑnt⁢F/𝒱nt]⁢(ω)]	
		=𝔼H⁢[ϑnt⁢F⁢(ω)]	
		=𝔼H⁢[F⁢(ω+ynt)].	

On the other hand, for any square-integrable function f on [0,1]n we have

	Fn⁢(ω+y)=	Fn⁢(ω+yt)	
	=	f(δHKHu0t+(KHu0t,KH-1yt)L2⁢([0,1]),…,	
		…,δHKHunt+(KHunt,KH-1yt)L2⁢([0,1]))	
	=	f(δHKHu0t+(KHu0t,πtHKH-1ynt)L2⁣([0,1]],…,	
		…,δHKHunt+(KHunt,πtHKH-1ynt)L2⁢([0,1]))	
	=	Fn⁢(ω+ynt)	
	=	𝔼H⁢[F⁢(ω+ynt)/𝒱nt]	
	≥	𝔼H⁢[F/𝒱nt]⁢(ω)	
	=	Fn⁢(ω)-a.s.	




Positive correlation 213 Thus, we conclude that the smooth function Fn⁢(w+τ⁢y) is increasing in τ, for any τ∈ℝ where πtHH⁢KH-1⁢ynt=KH-1⁢ynt is positive, hence we have from (4) that (∇⁡F𝔫,KH-1⁢y)L2⁢([0,1]) is positive. Since ∇⁡Fn is positive and ∇⁡Fn→∇⁡F then ∇⁡F is also positive. To complete the proof, it suffices to use the fact that

	
δH⁢(πtH⁢∇⁡F)=∫0tKH-1⁢[∇⁡F]⁢(s)⁢δH⁢Ws
	

and because ∇⁡F positive we get KH-1⁢[∇⁡F]⁢(s)≥0, a.s. Theorem 4 For any increasing functional F∈L2⁢(ℙH) we have

	
𝔼H⁢[KH-1⁢(∇⁡F)⁢(s)∣ℱsH]≥0,dt×d⁢ℙH- a.s. 
	

Proof. Let {TtH,t≥0} be a semigroup defined as in (3), and assume that F is increasing functional in L2⁢(ℙH). Taking t=1/n,∀n≥1, we have T1/nH⁢F is also increasing from (3) and element of 𝒟2,1H. Hence from lemma 3, ∇⁡T1/nH⁢F is positive and also KH-1⁢[∇⁡T1/nH⁢F]⁢(s)≥0, a.s., then 𝔼H⁢[KH-1⁢(∇⁡T1/nH⁢F)⁢(t)∣ℱtH] follows. Finally, using the fact that T1/nH⁢F→F as n goes to infinity we get the result. References [1] D. Bakry, D. Michel, Sur les inégalités FKG, Séminaire de Probabilités. XXVI.

Due to (5.27) two of the Stokes multipliers sk determine all others; they depend neither on λ nor on ζ provided Ω⁢(ζ) satisfies (5.1).

In order to obtain a parametrization of solutions to the P-I equation (5.1) by Stokes multipliers of the linear differential equation (LABEL:u-lam) one has to reformulate the above definitions as a certain Riemann - Hilbert problem. The solution of the Riemann - Hilbert problem depends on ζ through the asymptotics (LABEL:asym). If the Riemann - Hilbert problem has a unique solution for the given ζ0∈ℂ then the canonical matrices Φk⁢(λ,ζ) depend analytically on ζ for sufficiently small |ζ-ζ0|; the coefficient Ω=Ω⁢(ζ) will then satisfy (5.1). The poles of the meromorphic function Ω⁢(ζ) correspond to the forbidden values of the parameter ζ for which the Riemann - Hilbert problem admits no solution.

We will now consider a particular solution to the P-I equation specified by the following Riemann - Hilbert problem. Denote four oriented rays γ0, γ±1, ρ in the complex λ-plane defined by

	γk={λ∈ℂ|arg⁡λ=2⁢π⁢k5},k=0,±1

	Φ+⁢(λ,ζ)=Φ-⁢(λ,ζ)⁢Sk,λ∈γk	
			(5.29)
	Φ+⁢(λ,ζ)=Φ-⁢(λ,ζ)⁢Sρ,λ∈ρ.

"2.2 Poles of y : cubic oscillator So far we dealt with the system (112) in a region U which does not contain any pole of y⁢(z). Indeed, the situation at a pole is different, for equation (1) makes no sense.

In order to be able to describe the local behavior of Φ→⁢(λ,z) near a pole a of y⁢(z), we have to know the local behavior of y⁢(z) close to the same point a.

Proposition 1.11 leads to the following unexpected but useful result. 1.12. Theorem. If A is purifiable in G, then there exists a subsocle T of G such that every pure hull of A is T-high in G.

PURIFIABLE SUBGROUPS AND THE INTERSECTION PROBLEM 315 Proof. By Proposition 1.3 (1), A is m-vertical in G for some nonnegative integer m. Let H be a pure hull of A in G, then note that pm⁢H⁢[p]=(A∩pm⁢G)⁢[p]. We can write pm⁢G⁢[p]=(A∩pm⁢G)⁢[p]⊕Tm for some subsocle Tm of G. By [4, Theorem 1.7] and [2, Theorem 1.7], we have AGn=AHn+AnG and A+pn+1⁢H⊃pn⁢H⁢[p] for all n≥0. Hence we have

SOME CHARACTERIZATIONS OF SUBMODULES OF Q⁢T⁢A⁢G-MODULES 41 such that K=A⊕C,Soc⁡(A)=Soc⁡(N),Hk-1⁢(C)≠0 and Hk⁢(C)=0 and

	
Soc⁡((Ht⁢(M)+N)/N)=Soc⁡((Ht⁢(K)+N)/N)⊕(Soc⁡(Ht⁢(M)+N)/N).
	

Now we are able to prove the following: Theorem 5. Let N be a semi h-pure submodule of M.Then there exists a subsocle S of M such that every h-pure hull of N is S-high in M.

Proof. Since N is semi h-pure in M,there exists a non-negative integer k such that

	
(N+Ht+1⁢(M))∩Soc⁡(Ht⁢(M))≅(N∩Soc⁡(Ht⁢(M)))+Soc⁡(Ht+1⁢(M))
	

∀t⩾k i.e. N is a k⁢V-submodule of M.Consider the h-pure hull K of N in M,then

	
Soc⁡(Hk⁢(K))=Soc⁡(N∩Hk⁢(M)).
	

Therefore,

	
Soc⁡(Hk⁢(M))=Soc⁡(N∩Hk⁢(M))⊕Sk
	

for some subsocle Sk of M. Since Nt⁢(M)=Nt⁢(K)+Nt⁢(M) and Soc⁡(Ht⁢(K))⊂Soc⁡(Ht+1⁢(K))+N, ∀t⩾0,Soc⁡(Hk-1⁢(M))=Nk-1⁢(M)⊕Sk-1 for some subsocle Sk-1 of M. Therefore,

	Soc⁡(Hk-1⁢(M))	=Nk-1⁢(K)+Nk-1⁢(M)⊕Sk-1	
		=(Soc⁡(Hk-1⁢(K))+Soc⁡(Hk⁢(M)))⊕Sk-1	
		=Soc⁡(Hk-1⁢(K))⊕Sk⊕Sk-1	

On repeating the same process, after a finite number of steps we get

	
Soc⁡(M)=Soc⁡(K)⊕Sk⊕Sk-1⊕…⁢…⊕S0.
	

where each Si is a subsocle of M. This implies that every h-pure hull of N in M is S-high in M, where S=Sk⊕ Sk-1⊕…⁢…⊕S0. An immediate consequence of the above result is stated below: For any two h-pure hulls L,K of a submodule N of M

Put S=pn⁢G⁢[p]+pn⁢H⁢[p],T=pn+1⁢G⁢[p]+pn⁢H⁢[p], and U=H. Since S∩U⊂T, we have

Since a submodule K is h-pure in M if all the elements of the S⁢o⁢c⁢(K) have the same height in K as in M, this result with the above discussion enabled us to write tth  Ulm Kaplansky invariant of N with respect to M. Again we have

 As ⁢Soc⁡(Ht⁢(M/K))/Soc⁡(Ht+1⁢(M/K))≅(K+Soc⁡(Ht⁢(M)))/(K+Soc⁡(Ht+1⁢(M)))

"In this article, as the first step toward solving the intersection problem, we study the problem for subgroups which are already purifiable. Before we give necessary conditions for subgroups to be intersections of finitely many pure subgroups in given groups, we need the following lemmas. 3.1. LemMA. Let M be a non-negative integer. Let A be m vertical and purifiable in G and let L be a pure subgroup of G containing A. Then

	
dim⁡An⁢(G)/An⁢(L)≤Comn⁡(G,A)
	

for every integer n≥0. Proof. Let H be a pure hull of A in G. Note that pm⁢H⁢[p]= (A∩pm⁢G)⁢[p] and pm⁢G⁢[p]=(A∩pm⁢G)⁢[p]⊕Tm for some subsocle Tm of G. For every n≥m, since pn⁢L⁢[p]=(A∩pn⁢G)⁢[p]⊕(L∩Tn), we have pn⁢G⁢[p]=pn⁢L⁢[p]⊕Tn′ for some subgroup Tn′ of Tn. By Lemma 2.7, we have An⁢(G)/An⁢(L)≃pn⁢G⁢[p]/pn⁢L⁢[p]≃Tn′⊂Tn≃ Comn⁡(G,A). Hence we may assume that n<m. By the proof of Theorem 1.12, it follows that

	pm-1⁢G⁢[p]	=AGm-1⊕Sm-1=(ALm-1+pm⁢G⁢[p])⊕Sm-1	
		=((ALm-1+(A∩pm⁢G)⁢[p])⊕Tm)⊕Sm-1	

where Sm-1 is a subsocle of G. Hence we have pm-1⁢G⁢[p]=pm-1⁢L⁢[p] ⊕Rm-1 for some subgroup Rm-1 of Tm⊕Sm-1. Since pm-1⁢G⁢[p]= pm-1⁢H⁢[p]⊕Tm⊕Sm-1, our assertion holds for n=m-1 by Lemma 2.7. By finitely many steps, we have dim⁡An⁢(G)/An⁢(L)≤Comn⁡(G,A) for every n<m. 3.2. LemMA. Let A be purifiable in G. If A is an intersection of finitely many pure subgroups in G, then there exists a positive integer t such that

	
Cov0⁡(G,A)≤t⁢Com0⁡(G,A).
	




PURIFIABLE SUBGROUPS AND THE INTERSECTION PROBLEM 319 Proof. Let A=⋂i=1tHi where Hi is a pure subgroup of G containing A. Put H0=H and Ws=⋂i=0sA0⁢(Hi). Then we have

	
Cov0⁡(G,A)=∑i=0t-1dim⁡(Ws/Ws+1).
	

Since Ws/Ws+1=Ws/(Ws∩A0⁢(Hs+1))≃(Ws+A0⁢(Hs+1))/A0⁢(Hs+1)⊂ A0⁢(G)/A0⁢(Hs+1), by Lemma 3.1, we have

	
dim⁡Ws/Ws+1≤dim⁡A0⁢(G)/A0⁢(H)=Com0⁡(G,A).
	

Hence it follows that Cov0⁡(G,A)≤t⁢Com0⁡(G,A). 3.3. LEMMA. Let A be purifiable in G. Then, for every integer n≥0,Covn⁡(G,A)=Cov0⁡(pn⁢G,pn⁢G∩A) and Comn⁡(G,A)= Com0⁡(pn⁢G,pn⁢G∩A).

Proof. Let H be a pure hull of A in G. By [1, Theorem 5.3], pn⁢H is a pure hull of A∩pn⁢G in pn⁢G and A∩pn⁢G=A∩pn⁢H. Hence we have Cov0⁡(pn⁢G,pn⁢G∩A)=dim⁡(pn⁢H/(pn⁢H∩A))⁢[p]=dim⁡An⁢(H)= Covn⁡(G,A) and Com0⁡(pn⁢G,pn⁢G∩A)=dim⁡(pn⁢G⁢[p]/pn⁢H⁢[p])= Comn⁡(G,A). 3.4. Theorem. Let A be purifiable in G. If A is an intersection of finitely many pure subgroups in G, then, for every integer n≥0, there exists a positive integer tn such that

	
Covn⁡(G,A)≤tn⁢Comn⁡(G,A).
	

Proof. Let A=⋂i=1tHi where Hi is a pure subgroup of G containing A. By [1, Theorem 5.3], A∩pn⁢G is purifiable in pn⁢G. Moreover, we have A∩pn⁢G=⋂i=1t(Hi∩pn⁢G)=⋂i=1tpn⁢Hi and pn⁢Hi is a pure subgroup of pn⁢G containing A∩pn⁢G. Hence, by Lemma 3.2 and Lemma 3.3, there exists a positive integer tn such that Covn⁡(G,A)≤tn⁢Comn⁡(G,A).

Theorem 3.4 gives necessary conditions on a purifiable subgroup to be an intersection of finitely many pure subgroups in a given group. It is natural to consider whether these conditions are sufficient. But, since the Intersection Problem is difficult, we do not know the answer at the present time.","To study the intersections of finitely many h-pure submodules of M containing N, we need some notations and lemmas:

Lemma 8. Let N be a semi h-pure and k⁢V-submodule of M contained in a h-pure submodule A of M.Then

	
g(((Soc(Ht(M))+N)/N)/(Soc(Ht(A))+N)/N))⩽g(Soc(Ht(M))/Soc(Ht(K)))
	

for every integer t⩾0 and h-pure hull K of N in M. Proof. Since K is a h-pure hull of N in M,Soc⁡(Hk⁢(K))=Soc⁡(N∩Hk⁢(M)) and Soc⁡(Hk⁢(M))=Soc⁡(N∩Hk⁢(M))⊕Sk for some subsocle Sk of M.For every t⩾k, we have Soc⁡(Ht⁢(A))=Soc⁡(N∩Ht⁢(M))⊕(A∩St) and Soc⁡(Ht⁢(M))=Soc⁡(Ht⁢(A))⊕St′ for some submodule St′ of the subsocle St. Now by Lemma 7 ,

	
Soc⁡((Ht⁢(M)+N)/N)/Soc⁡((Ht⁢(A)+N)/N)≅Soc⁡(Ht⁢(M))/Soc⁡(Ht⁢(A))
≅St′⊂St≅Soc⁡(Ht⁢(M))/Soc⁡(Ht⁢(K))
	

So we may assume t<k. On the similar lines of Theorem 5 , we can say that

	Soc(Hk-1(M)	=((N+Hk⁢(M))∩Soc⁡(Hk-1⁢(M)))⊕Sk-1	
		=((N+Hk⁢(A))∩Soc⁡(Hk-1⁢(A)))+Soc⁡(Hk⁢(M))⊕Sk-1	
		=((N+Hk⁢(A))∩Soc⁡(Hk-1⁢(A)))+Soc⁡(N∩Hk⁢(M))⊕Sk⊕Sk-1	




44 ALVEERA MEHDI FAHAD SIKANDER where Sk-1 is a subsocle of M. Now we have Soc⁡(Hk-1⁢(M))=Soc⁡(Hk-1⁢(A))⊕Ck-1, where Ck-1 is a submodule of Sk⊕Sk-1. Because Soc⁡(Hk-1⁢(M))=Soc⁡(Hk-1⁢(K))⊕Sk⊕Sk-1, the result holds for t=k-1. On the lines of Lemma 4 , if we repeat the steps we have

	
g((Soc(Ht(M)+N)/N)/(Soc((Ht(A)+N)/N)⩽g(Soc(Ht(M)/Soc(Ht(N)))
	

Lemma 9. Let N be a semi h-pure submodule of M which is an intersection of finitely many h-pure submodules in M. Then there exist a positive integer l such that

	
g⁢(Soc⁡(K/N))⩽l⁢g⁢(Soc⁡M/Soc⁡K)
	

where K is a h-pure hull of N. Proof. Let N=⋂i=1lKi, where each Ki is h-pure submodule of M containing N. We may define K0=K and Lm=⋂i=0mSoc⁡(Ki+NN) and we have As

	
g⁢(L0L1)+g⁢(L1L2)+…⁢…⁢…+g⁢(Ll-1Ll)=g⁢(Soc⁡(KN))
	
	
Lm-1Lm=Lm-1Lm∩Soc⁡(Km/N)≅Lm+Soc⁡(Km/N)Soc⁡(Km/N)⊆Soc⁡(M/N)/Soc⁡(Km/N).
	

By the previous lemma

	
g⁢(Lm-1Lm)⩽g⁢(Soc⁡(M/N)/Soc⁡(K/N))=g⁢(Soc⁡(M)/Soc⁡(K)).
	

This implies that

	
g⁢(Soc⁡(K/N))⩽l⁢g⁢(Soc⁡(M)/Soc⁡(N)).
	

Lemma 10. Let N be a semi h-pure submodule of M.Then for every integer k⩾0,

	
g⁢(Soc⁡(Hk⁢(K/N)))=g⁢(Soc⁡(Hk⁢(M)Hk⁢(M)∩N))⁢ and 
g⁢(Soc⁡(Hk⁢(M))/Soc⁡(Hk⁢(K)))=g⁢(Soc⁡(Hk⁢(M))/Soc⁡(Hk⁢(M))∩N)
	

Proof. Since K is a h-pure hull of N in M,Hk⁢(K) is a h-pure hull of N∩Hk⁢(M) in Hk⁢(M) and N∩Hk⁢(M)=N∩Hk⁢(K).

SOME CHARACTERIZATIONS OF SUBMODULES OF QTAG-MODULES 45 Therefore,

	
g(Soc(Hk(K))/(Hk(K)∩N))=g(Soc(Hk(K/N))
=g⁢(Soc⁡(Hk⁢(M))/(Soc⁡(Hk⁢(M))∩N))⁢ and 
g(Soc(Hk(M))/(Soc(Hk(M)∩N))=g(Soc⁡(Hk⁢(M))Soc⁡(Hk⁢(K)))
	

Now we can prove the following: Theorem 11.Let N be a semi h-pure submodule of M.If N is an intersection of finitely many h-pure submodules in M, then for all integer k⩾0, there exist a positive integer lk such that

	
g⁢(Soc⁡(Hk⁢(K/N)))⩽lk⁢g⁢(Soc⁡(Hk⁢(M))Soc⁡(Hk⁢(K)))
	

where K is a h-pure hull of N in M. Proof. Let N=⋂i=1lKi, where each Ki is a h-pure submodule of M containing N.Now N∩Hk⁢(M) is semi h-pure in Hk⁢(M) and we also have that

	
N∩Hk⁢(M)=⋂i=1l(Ki∩Hk⁢(M))=⋂i=1lHk⁢(K⁢i)
	

and Hk⁢(Ki) is a h-pure submodule of Hk⁢(M) containing N∩Hk⁢(M). Therefore by Lemma 9 and 10 there exists a positive integer lk

	
g⁢(Soc⁡(Hk⁢(K/N)))⩽lk⁢g⁢(Soc⁡(Hk⁢(M))Soc⁡(Hk⁢(K))).
	

The above theorem does not throw any light on the sufficiency of the conditions.In the end we would like to state some open problems:

"Abstract. Given a graph G=(V,E), we say that a vertex subset S⊆V covers a vertex v∈V if the edge-connectivity between S and v is at least a given integer k, and also say that S covers an edge v⁢w∈E if v and w are covered. We propose the multi-commodity source location problem, which is such that given a vertex- and edge-weighted graph G,r players each select p vertices, and obtain a profit that is the total weight of covered vertices and edges. However, vertices selected by one player cannot be selected by the other players. The goal is to maximize the total profits of all players. We show that the price of greed, which indicates the ratio of the total profit of cooperating players to that of selfish players, is tightly bounded by min⁡{r,p}. Also when k=2, we obtain tight bounds for vertex-unweighted trees. Keywords: Source location problem, price of greed. 1 Introduction Given an undirected graph G=(V,E) with vertex set V, edge set E and an edge capacity function, the edge-connectivity between S⊆V and v∈V is the minimum total capacity of a set of edges such that v is disconnected from S by removal of these edges. We say that a set S⊆V of vertices (called sources) covers v∈V if the edge-connectivity between S and v is at least k, where k≥1 is a given integer. The source location problem is to find a minimum-size source set S⊆V covering all vertices in V. This problem has been studied widely [2367810[1215, and such problems are important in the design of networks resistant to the failure of edges.

In real networks, there are multiple service providers, and they locate servers in networks in order to supply services. Thus we propose the multi-commodity source location problem. In this problem, a network N=(G=(V,E),w,c), and positive integers k,r and p are given, where G is an undirected and connected graph, c:E→𝐙+is an edge capacity function, w:V∪E→𝐑+is a vertexand edge-weight function, and r is the number of players, where 𝐙+(resp., 𝐑+) S.-i.

170 H. Ito, M. Paterson, and K. Sugihara denotes the set of non-negative integers (resp., real numbers). Players 1,2,…,r each locate p sources on vertices of G. However, if a player locates a source on a vertex, then it is unavailable for the other players to locate a source on. Let player i ’s profit be the total weight of vertices and edges covered by the sources located by the player i, where a source set S covers an edge e=v⁢w if both v and w are covered by S. The goal of this problem is to maximize the sum of the profits of all players. When r=1, the problem is the same as the maximumcover source-location problem [12]. This problem is NP-hard [14], but it can be solved in polynomial time when k≤3[1213∣14.

In recent years, game theory has attracted attention in certain fields of computer science. In various real problems, e.g., routing, network design and scheduling, the selfish actions of agents are obstacles to optimization for social welfare. Such phenomena are modeled as games, and the influence of selfish actions of players have been extensively analysed [1 5 11. In this paper, we consider the influence of selfish actions of providers on network reliability. Generally the quality of services of newcomers are influenced by the services of preceding providers. For example, the location of servers becomes restricted and consequently their profits may be smaller. We analyze the phenomenon by means of a selfish model in the multi-commodity source location problem.

The selfish model is such that players 1,2,…,r locate p sources in this order on vertices of G so as to maximize their own profits. Note that as described previously, player i cannot locate sources on the vertices on which one of players 1,…,i-1 has already located sources. We compare the social welfare of this model to that of the case where all players cooperate, that is, optimal solutions of the problem. Figure1 shows an example when k=2,r=3 and p=3. The numbers beside vertices and edges denote their weights, and the edge capacities are uniformly one. The selfish player 1 locates sources to maximize his/her profit (see Fig. 1 (a)). The source set {a,i,j} of the player 1 covers vertices a,b,c,d,h,i,j and he/she gets profit 29 . The selfish player 2 then locates sources on vertices not already occupied such that his/her own profit is maximum in this situation. The source set {c,g,h} of the player 2 covers vertices a,b,c,d,g,h and his/her profit is 25 . Then selfish player 3 does similarly and gets profit 6 since his/her source set {b,e,f} covers vertices a,b,c,d,e,f. The total profit is 29+25+6=60. In contrast, the optimal players 1, 2 and 3 locate their sources as in Fig. 11(b), so that the players share as many covered vertices and edges as possible. The optimal players 1, 2 and 3 obtain profits 28, 27 and 25, respectively, and the total is 80 .

As a measure of the influence of the selfish behaviours based on the ordering of players, we propose the price of greed, which represents the ratio of the maximum total profit of the cooperating players to the worst, i.e., minimum, total profit of the selfish players. Formally, let the price of greed for the multi-commodity source location problem be

	
P⁢O⁢Gk⁢(N,r,p)= the optimal total profit  the worst selfish total profit .

A well-known similar measure, the price of anarchy is the ratio of the worst cost of Nash equilibria of selfish players to the optimal cost [11]. The locations of sources derived by our selfish model are Nash equilibria, since no player can gain profit by changing their locations. However, the locations are only a component of all Nash equilibria, and we analyze influence of the greedy behaviour based on the ordered strategy in our model. Thus we use the different name.

Our Results. Our goal is to analyze the maximum value of the price of greed P⁢O⁢Gk⁢(r,p)=maxN⁡P⁢O⁢Gk⁢(N,r,p). When k=1, it is clear that P⁢O⁢G1⁢(r,p)=1 for any r,p≥1, since all vertices and edges are covered, wherever the sources are located. Hence we assume k≥2. First, we show the following tight bounds for the general case. Theorem 1. P⁢O⁢Gk⁢(r,p)=min⁡{r,p} for any k≥2,r≥1 and p≥1.","Abstract Given a graph G=(V,E), we say that a vertex subset S⊆V covers a vertex v∈V if the edge-connectivity between S and v is at least a given integer k, and also say that S covers an edge v⁢w∈E if v and w are both covered. We propose the multi-commodity source location problem, which is such that given a vertex- and edge-weighted graph G,p players each select q vertices, and obtain a profit that is the total over all players of the weight of each player’s covered vertices and edges. However, vertices selected by one player cannot be selected by the other players. The goal is to maximize the total profits of all players. We show that the price of greed, which indicates the ratio of the total profit of cooperating players to that of selfish players based on an ordered strategy, is tightly bounded by min⁡{p,q}. Also when k=2, we obtain tight bounds for vertex-unweighted trees when sources are located on the leaves.

56 H. Ito et al. Source Location and Price of Greed 1 Introduction Given an undirected graph G=(V,E) with vertex set V, edge set E and an edge capacity function, the edge-connectivity between S⊆V and v∈V is the minimum total capacity of a set of edges such that v is disconnected from S by removal of these edges. For a given integer k, where k≥1, we say that a set S⊆V of vertices (called sources) covers v∈V if the edge-connectivity between S and v is at least k. The source location problem is to find a minimum-size source set S⊆V covering all vertices in V. This problem has been studied widely [2, 3, 6, 7, 8, 10, 13, 15, and such problems are important in the design of networks resistant to the failure of edges.

In real networks, there are multiple service providers, and they locate servers in networks in order to supply services. Thus we propose the multi-commodity source location problem. In this problem, a network N=(G=(V,E),w,c) and positive integers k,p and q are given, where G is an undirected connected graph with |V|≥p⁢q,c:E→𝐙+is an edge capacity function, w:V∪E→𝐑+ is a vertex- and edge-weight function, and p is the number of players. Here 𝐙+(resp., 𝐑+) denotes the set of non-negative integers (resp., real numbers). Players 1,2,…,p each locate q sources on vertices of G. However, if a player locates a source on a vertex, then it is unavailable for the other players to locate a source on. Let player i ’s profit be the total weight of vertices and edges covered by the sources located by player i, where a source set S covers an edge e=v⁢w if both v and w are covered by S. The goal of this problem is to maximize the sum of the profits of all players. When p=1, the problem is the same as the maximum-cover source-location problem [13. This problem is NP-hard [14, but it can be solved in polynomial time when k≤3 [13, 12, 14 .

In recent years, game theory has attracted attention in certain fields of computer science. In various real problems, e.g., routing, network design and scheduling, the selfish actions of agents are obstacles to the optimization of social welfare. Such phenomena are modeled as games, and the influence of selfish actions of players has been extensively analysed [1, 5, 11]. In this paper, we consider the influence of selfish actions of providers on network reliability. Generally the quality of service of newcomers is influenced by the actions of preceding providers. For example, the location of servers becomes restricted and consequently their profits may be smaller. We analyze the phenomenon by means of a selfish model in the multi-commodity source location problem. In our model, each player plays just once, in a fixed order, i.e., the ”game” consists of a single round.

The selfish model is such that players 1,2,…,p in this order locate q sources on vertices of G so as to maximize their own profits. Note that as described previously, player i cannot locate sources on the vertices on which one of players 1,…,i-1 has already located sources. We compare the social welfare of this model to that of the case where all players cooperate, that is, optimal solutions of the problem. Figure 1 shows an example when k=2,p=3 and q=3. The numbers beside vertices and edges denote their weights, and the edge capacities are uniformly one. Selfish player 1 locates sources to maximize his/her profit

(see Fig. 1(a)). The source set {a,i,j} of player 1 covers vertices a,b,c,d,h,i,j and he/she gets profit 29. Selfish player 2 then locates sources on vertices not already occupied such that his/her own profit is maximum in this situation. The source set {c,g,h} of player 2 covers vertices a,b,c,d,g,h and his/her profit is 25. Then, selfish player 3 does similarly and gets profit 6 since his/her source set {b,e,f} covers vertices a,b,c,d,e,f. The total profit is 29+25+6=60. In contrast, optimal players 1, 2 and 3 locate their sources as in Fig. 1(b), so that the players share as many covered vertices and edges as possible. Optimal players 1, 2 and 3 obtain profits 28, 27 and 25, respectively, and the total is 80 . As a measure of the influence of the selfish behaviour based on the ordering of players, we propose the price of greed, which represents the ratio of the maximum total profit of the cooperating players to the worst, i.e., minimum, total profit of the selfish players. Formally, let the price of greed for the multi-commodity source location problem be

	
POGk⁡(N,p,q)= the optimal total profit  the worst selfish total profit .
	

The price of greed of the example in Fig. 1 is POG2(N,3,3)=(28+27+ 25)/(29+25+6)=4/3.

A well-known similar measure, the price of anarchy is the ratio of the worst cost of Nash equilibria of selfish players to the optimal cost [11]. The locations of sources derived by our selfish model are Nash equilibria, since no player can gain profit by changing their locations. However, the locations are only a component of all Nash equilibria, and we analyze the influence of the greedy behaviour based on the ordered strategy in our model. Thus we introduce the new measure. Note also that for P⁢O⁢G we deal with profits whereas for the price of anarchy we consider costs. Thus, for P⁢O⁢G we have the optimal profit in the

58 H. Ito et al. Source Location and Price of Greed numerator (the selfish profit in the denominator) whereas in the price of anarchy the optimal cost is in the denominator (the selfish cost is in the numerator). Our choice is such that the ”price” of ”selfish behaviour” is greater than one, and in most of our results will be an integer.

Our Results Our goal is to analyze the maximum value of the price of greed P⁢O⁢Gk⁢(p,q)=maxN⁡P⁢O⁢Gk⁢(N,p,q). When k=1, it is clear that P⁢O⁢G1⁢(p,q)= 1 for any p,q≥1, since all vertices and all edges are covered, wherever the sources are located. Hence we assume k≥2.

"Lemma 2 depends on the following lemma. Lemma 1. For any i⁢(1≤i≤⌊r-1p⌋+1), we have Wi′≥W(i-1)⁢p+1.

Multi-commodity Source Location Problems and Price of Greed 173 Proof. When i=1, the inequality W1′≥W1 evidently holds. Then we consider i≥2.

In the case of q>p≥2, consider the previously shown Fig. 2, but assume that the weight of the edge u⁢v is 1 and the weights of the other edges are 0 . Let |X|=p,|Y|=p⁢q-p. Selfish player 1 may locate p sources on X and q-p sources on Y, and obtain profit 1. Then the other selfish players cannot obtain any profit. Each of the optimal players 1,2,…,p obtains profit 1 by locating one source on X and q-1 sources on Y, and so the total optimal profit is p. This network N has P⁢O⁢G2⁢(N,p,q)=p=min⁡{p,q-1}.

For p≥q≥3, in Fig. 2 again let the weight of the edge u⁢v be 1 and that of the other edges be 0 . Let |X|=q-1 and |Y|=p⁢q-q+1. Selfish player 1 may locate q-1 sources on X and one source on Y, and obtain profit 1 , while the other selfish players obtain no profits. Each of the optimal players 1,2,…,q-1(≤p) obtains profit 1 by locating one source on X and q-1 sources on Y, and the other optimal players obtain no profit. The total optimal profit is q-1, and so this network N has P⁢O⁢G2⁢(N,p,q)=q-1=min⁡{p,q-1}.
For the remaining case, p≥2 and q=2, we show that P⁢O⁢G2⁢(N,p,2)=2 for the network N in Fig. 6. The numbers beside edges denote their weights, and |Y|=2⁢p-2. Selfish player 1 may locate two sources on X and obtains profit 2, while the other selfish players obtain no profits. On the other hand, optimal players 1 and 2 each obtain profit 2, by locating one source on X and the other one on Y. The other optimal players obtain no profits. Hence the least selfish total profit and the optimal one are 2 and 4 , respectively. Hence PO⁢G2⁢(N,p,2)=2 for this network N. Therefore P⁢O⁢G2⁢(N,p,2)=min⁡{p,2} for p≥2 and q=2.

Introduction Since the closed-form solution of the European call option was derived by Black and Scholes [1], many methodologies for the option pricing have been proposed by using the modification of BlackScholes formula. The input parameters of the Black-Scholes formula are usually regarded as the precise real-valued data; that is, the input data are considered as the real numbers. However, in the real world, some parameters in the Black-Scholes formula cannot always be expected in a precise sense. For instance, the risk-free interest rate r may occur imprecisely. Therefore, the fuzzy sets theory proposed by Zadeh [2] may be a useful tool for modeling this kind of imprecise problem. The book of collected papers edited by Ribeiro et al.

Introduction Since the closed-form solution of the European currency options pricing model was derived by Garman and Kohlhagen (1983) based on Black and Scholes (1973), many methodologies for the currency options pricing have been proposed by using the modification of Garman-Kohlhagen (G-K) model, such as Amin and Jarrow (1991), Heston (1993), Bates (1996), Ekvall et al. (1997), Lim et al. (1998), Rosenberg (1998), Sarwar and Krehbiel (2000), Bollen and Rasiel (2003). The input variables of the G-K model are usually regarded as the precise real numbers. However, in the real world, these variables cannot always be expected in a precise sense. For instance, the spot exchange rates fluctuate from time to time according to the financial market effects and may occur imprecisely. It is more suitable and realistic to price currency options under fuzzy environments because these variables are only available imprecise data or data related in a vague way. Practically, many financial investors are concerned with the currency options price range, i.e. the confidence interval.

"In the constant interest rate approach, when the financial analyst tries to price an option, the interest rate is assumed as a constant. However, the interest rate may have the different values in the different commercial banks and financial institutions. Therefore, the choice of a reasonable interest rate may cause a dilemma (Note that the situation for the different interest rates in the different commercial banks and financial institutions may not be regarded as a kind of randomness). But one thing can be sure is that the different interest rates may be around a fixed value within a short period of time. For instance, the interest rates may be around 5% (The phrase ”around 5%” might have problems to be modeled by using the probability theory. Of course, it might be possible to enforce to model this phrase ”around 5% ” by using the probability theory. However, under this situation, the structure of the interest rate could be very complicated. Then it might cause the difficulties for further analysis). In this case, the interest rate may be regarded as a fuzzy number 5~% when the financial analyst tries to price an European call option using the Black-Scholes formula.

"The usual approach for options pricing is to pick a fixed stock price to price an option by applying the Black-Scholes formula. However, this option price will be used for the further decision making by a financial analyst within a short period of time. The problem is that the stock price will be changed within this short period of time because the stock price fluctuates very irregular (assumed to be a Brownian motion). Therefore, it is a little unreasonable to pick a fixed stock price to price an option at this time and then use this option price for later use, since the later stock price has already changed. Therefore, it is also natural to assume the stock price as a fuzzy number. If this assumption does not convince the financial analysts, then they still can take the stock price as a real number and just consider the fuzzy interest rate and fuzzy volatility. Under this situation, the methodology proposed in this paper is still applicable since the real numbers are the special case of the fuzzy numbers.

Although we have described how the fuzzy interest rate, fuzzy volatility and fuzzy stock price occur in the real world, some of those three input data can still be taken as the real numbers (it is also called the crisp numbers in the fuzzy literature) if the financial analyst can make sure that those data occur in a crisp sense. In this case, the methodology proposed in this paper is still applicable since the real numbers (crisp numbers) are the degenerated case (special case) of the fuzzy numbers. Now, under the considerations of fuzzy interest rate, fuzzy volatility and fuzzy stock price, the option price will turn into a fuzzy number. The price of a European call option can now be interpreted as ”around $⁡3.5,” for instance. The phrase ”around $⁡3.5 ” is regarded as a fuzzy number 3.5~. The fuzzy number 3.5~ is in fact a function defined on 𝐑 into [0,1], and denoted by μ3.5~⁢(r). Given any value r0, the function value μ3.5~⁢(r0) will be interpreted as the belief degree of closeness to value 3.5. The graph of this function μ3.5⁢(r) will be bell shaped. It means that the closer the value r0 to 3.5 is, the higher the belief degree is. Therefore, the financial analyst can pick any value which is around 3.5 with an acceptable belief degree as the option price for his (her) later use. In order to obtain the belief degree of any given option price, an optimization problem will be solved. An efficient computational procedure is proposed in this paper to solve this optimization problem.

This paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, the notions of fuzzy number and the arithmetics of fuzzy numbers are introduced. In Section 3, the notion of fuzzy random variable is introduced. In Section 4, the fuzzy patterns of the Black-Scholes formula and put-call parity relationship are proposed. In Section 5, the computational procedure is provided in order to obtain the belief degrees of any given option prices. Finally, the conclusions of this paper is depicted in the final Section 6.","The usual approach for currency option pricing is to pick fixed input data to price an option by applying the G-K model.

Therefore, it is also natural to assume these input data as fuzzy numbers.

Although it has been described that how the four fuzzy input variables occur in the real world, some of four variables can still be taken as the real (crisp) numbers if the financial investor can make sure that those variables occur in a crisp sense. In this case, the methodology proposed in this paper is still applicable since the real numbers are the special case of the fuzzy numbers. Now, under the considerations of the four fuzzy input variables, the currency option price will turn into a fuzzy number. This fuzzy number is in fact a function defined on ℝ into [0,1], and denoted by membership function μa~:X→[0,1]. Given any value c, the function value μa~⁢(c) will be interpreted as the belief degree of closeness to value a. It means that the closer the value c to a is, the higher the belief degree is. Therefore, the financial investors can pick any value that is around a with an acceptable belief degree as the currency option price for their later use. In order to obtain the belief degree of any a given option price, an optimization problem will be given.

"a~ is called a fuzzy number if the following conditions are satisfied: (i) a~ is a normal and convex fuzzy set. (ii) Its membership function μa~ is upper semicontinuous. (iii) The α-level set a~α is bounded for each α∈[0,1]. From Zadeh [2], A~ is a convex fuzzy set if and only if its α-level set A~α={x:μA~⁢(x)⩾α} is a convex set for all α. Therefore, if a~ is a fuzzy number, then the α-level set a~α is a compact (closed and bounded in 𝐑 ) and convex set; that is, a~ is a closed interval. The α-level set of a~ is then denoted by a~α=[a~αL,a~αU].

A fuzzy number a~ is said to be nonnegative if μa~⁢(x)=0 for x<0. It is easy to see that if a~ is a nonnegative fuzzy numbers then a~αL and a~αU are all nonnegative real numbers for all α∈[0,1]. The following proposition is useful for further discussion.

Proposition 2.1 (Zadeh [8, Resolution identity]). Let A~ be a fuzzy set with membership function μA~ and A~α={x:μA~⁢(x)⩾α}. Then

	
μA~⁢(x)=supα∈[0,1]⁡α⁢1A~α⁢(x),

Now it is the right time to introduce the arithmetics of any two fuzzy numbers. Let ” ⊙ ” be a binary operation ⊕,⊖,⊗ or ⊘ between two fuzzy numbers a~ and b~. The membership function of a~⊙b~ is defined by

	
μa~⊙b~⁢(z)=sup{(x,y):x∘y=z}⁡min⁡{μa~⁢(x),μb~⁢(y)},
	

where the binary operations ⊙⁣=⁣⊕,⊖,⊗ or ⊘ correspond to the binary operations ∘⁣=⁣+,-,× or / according to the ”Extension Principle” in Zadeh [2].

Let ” ⊙int  ” be a binary operation ⊕int ,Θint  or ⊗int  between two closed intervals [a,b] and [c,d]. Then [a,b]⊙int [c,d] is defined by

The membership function of f~⁢(A~) is defined by

The following proposition is very useful for discussing the fuzzy pattern of the Black-Scholes formula.

Proposition 2.3. Let f⁢(x) be a real-valued function and A~ be a fuzzy subset of 𝐑. The function f⁢(x) can induce a fuzzy-valued function f~:ℱ→ℱ via the extension principle. Suppose that the membership function μA~ of A~ is upper semicontinuous and {x:r=f⁢(x)} is a compact set (it will be a closed and bounded set in 𝐑) for all r, then the α-level set of f~⁢(A~) is (f~⁢(A~))α={f⁢(x):x∈A~α}. Proof. If r∈{f⁢(x):x∈A~α}, then there exists an x such that r=f⁢(x) and x∈A~α; that is, μA~⁢(x)⩾α. Thus, μf~⁢(A~)⁢(r)=sup{x:r=f⁢(x)}⁡μA~⁢(x)⩾α implies r∈(f~⁢(A~))α.

Therefore, r∈{f⁢(x):x∈A~α}. This completes the proof.","a~ is called a fuzzy number if the following three conditions are satisfied: (i) a~ is a normal and convex fuzzy set; (ii) Its membership function μa~⁢(x) is upper semi-continuous; (iii) The α-level set a~α is bounded for each α∈[0,1].

From Zadeh (1965), A~ is a convex fuzzy set if and only if its α-level set A~α={x∣μ𝒜⁢(x)⩾α} is a convex set for all α∈[0,1]. Therefore, if a~ is a fuzzy number, then the α-level set a~α is a compact (closed and bounded in ℝ ) and convex

A fuzzy number a~ is said to be nonnegative if μa~⁢(x)=0 for ∀x<0. It is easy to see that if a~ is a nonnegative fuzzy numbers then a~αL and a~αU are all nonnegative real numbers for all α∈[0,1]. The following proposition is useful for further discussion. A~α={x∣μA⁢(x)⩾α}. Then

	
μA⁢(x)=supα∈[0,1]⁡α⁢[1⁢A~α⁢(x)],
	

where 1∼A~α is an indicator function of set A~α, i.e., 1Aα⁢(x)=1 if x∈A~α and 1Aα⁢(x)=0 if x∉A~α. Note that the α-level set A~α of A~2 is a crisp (usual) set. The a~ is called a crisp number with value m if its membership function is

	
μa~⁢(x)={1,	 if ⁢x=m,
0,	 otherwise. 
	

It is denoted by a~=1~{m}. It is easy to see that (1~{m})αL=(1~{m}}αU=m for all α∈[0,1]. We see that the real numbers are the special case of the fuzzy numbers when the real numbers are regarded as the crisp numbers.

Now the algorithms between any two fuzzy numbers are introduced (Zadeh (1968); Santos (1970)). Let ” ⊙ ” be a binary operation ⊕,⊖,⊗, or ⊘ between two fuzzy numbers a~ and b~. The membership function of a~⊙b~ is defined by

	
μa~⊙b~⁢(z)=sup{(x,y)∣x×y=z}⁡min⁡{μa~⁢(x),μb~⁢(y)},
	

where the binary operations ⊙⁣=⁣⊕,⊖,⊗, or ⊘ correspond to the binary operations ∘⁣=⁣+,-,×, or / according to the ”Extension Principle” in Zadeh (1975).

Let ” ⊙int  ” be a binary operation ⊕int,⊖int or ⊗int between two closed intervals [a,b] and [c,d]. Then [a,b]⊙int [c,d] is defined by

	
[a,b]⊙int [c,d]≡{z∈ℝ∣z=x∘y,∀x∈[a,b],∀y∈[c,d], where ∘=+,-, or ×}.
	

Similarly, if the interval [c,d] does not contain zero, [a,b]⊘int [c,d] is defined by [a,b]⊘int [c,d]≡{z∈ℝ∣z=x/y,∀x∈[a,b],∀y∈[c,d], if and only if 0∉[c,d]}. Then the following well-known results are not hard to prove. Proposition 2. Let a~ and b~ be two fuzzy numbers. Then a~⊕b~,a~⊖b~ and a~⊗b~ are also fuzzy numbers and their α-level sets are

where S~t and C~t are fuzzy random variables, for all t∈[0,T]. Furthermore, the fuzzy price P~t of a European put option at time t with the same expiry date T and strike price K can be obtained by the following fuzzy pattern of put-call parity relationship:

	
P~t=C~t⊖S~t⊕(1~{K}⊗e-r~⊗1~{T-t})
	

for all t∈[0,T]. According to the ”Resolution identity” in Proposition 2.1, the membership function of C~t is given by

Computational method Given a European call currency option price c of the fuzzy price C~t at time t, it is important to know its membership value α, i.e., its belief degree. If the financial investors are acceptable with this membership value, then it will be reasonable to take the value c as the currency option price at time t. In this case, the financial investors can accept the value c as the currency option price at time t with belief degree α.

The membership function of fuzzy price C~t of a currency option at time t is given in Eq. (16). Therefore, given any currency option price c, its belief degree can be obtained by solving the following optimization problem (Wu,2005) :

188 PAUL HILL Proof. Condition (I) is obviously necessary, but its sufficiency is not trivial. We shall begin the proof with some preliminary remarks. Both A and A′ are isomorphic, in a natural way, to basic subgroups of H. Therefore A≅H≅A′, since H is a direct sum of cyclic groups. Write

	
𝐇=∑I{h𝐢},𝐀=∑I{a𝐢},𝐀′=∑I{a𝐢′}
	

Note that G/{G0,B} is divisible, since G/B is divisible. Thus we can write

	
𝐆/{𝐆0,𝐁}=∑𝐉𝐃𝐣  and  𝐆/{𝐆0,𝐁′}=∑𝐉𝐃𝐣′⁢, 
	

where Dj≅Z⁢(p∞)≅Djj for each j; in view of condition (I), we can use a common index set J. Observe that {G0,B} and {G0,B′} are pure subgroups of G. It is convenient to choose the index sets I and J to be the smallest possible ordinals. Thus we let

	
𝐈={α:α⁢ is an ordinal of cardinality less than ⁢𝐫⁢(H)}
𝐉={α:α⁢ is an ordinal of cardinality less than ⁢𝐫⁢(𝐆/{𝐆0,𝐁})}.
	

In this connection, we remark that the theorem follows immediately if either I or J is vacuous. If J is vacuous, then G0+A=G=G0+A′, and we obtain the desired automorphism of G by mapping A isomorphically onto A′. Observe that 𝐉⊆I (compare 𝐇≅𝐆/𝐆0 to 𝐆/{𝐆0,𝐁} ). If I is finite, then 𝐆0+𝐀=𝐆=𝐆0+𝐀′, since a finite group cannot have a proper basic subgroup; for notational convenience we therefore assume that I is infinite.

The proof of the theorem is a two-stage induction proof. The first stage of the induction is the following. Let π0 denote the identity map of G0. Suppose that γ∈I and that for each α<γ, we have a subgroup Gα of G and a height-preserving automorphism πα of 𝐆α (all heights are computed with respect to G ) such that 𝐆α⊆𝐆β and πβ is an extension of πα if α<β<γ. Assume, for each α<γ, that πα⁢(Gα∩B)=Gα∩B′. Further, assume that the following conditions are satisfied for suitable subsets I⁢(α) of I and J⁢(α) of J.

	
𝐆α=G0+∑I⁢(α){hi}
	
	
𝐆α∩𝐁=𝐁0+∑I⁢(α){𝐚i}

THE COVERING THEOREM FOR UPPER BASIC SUBGROUPS 189 If γ is a limit ordinal, we define Gγ=⋃α<γ𝐆α, and we let π⁢γ denote the automorphism of 𝐆γ such that πγ∣𝐆α=πα for each α<γ. The induction hypotheses continue to hold for α<γ if we let I⁢(γ)=⋃α<γI⁢(α) and J⁢(γ)=⋃α<γJ⁢(α). The nontrivial case arises when γ-1 exists, and here we employ the second stage of the induction to pass from γ-1 to γ. Of course, we could keep the induction technically alive by taking Gγ=Gγ-1 and πγ=πγ-1, but there is no point in that. For we want the subgroups Gα eventually to exhaust G. Thus it is appropriate to add the following condition to the induction hypotheses: (6) If α+1<γ, then α∈I⁢(α+1). For notational convenience in working with the secondary induction, we write β=γ-1. Assume that K and L are finite extensions of Gβ and that ϕ:K>⟶ is a height-preserving isomorphism from K onto L such that (*)

	
ϕ⁢(K∩B)=L∩B′⁢. 
	

We need to extend ϕ to a height-preserving automorphism πγ of a subgroup Gγ containing both K and L such that conditions (1) to (6) hold for α≤γ and such that πγ⁢(Gγ∩B)=Gγ∩B′. In particular, we want β to belong to Iγ. Let x∈ G. We claim that there exist finite extensions K+and L+of K and L (both containing x ) and a height-preserving isomorphism ϕ+:K+≫L+that extends ϕ, with the additional property ϕ+⁢(K+∩B)=L+∩B′. Because of the symmetry of K and L, it suffices to show that we can do this with x in K+(but not necessarily in L+); by a second application we can put x into L+. Thus we want to extend ϕ to a heightpreserving isomorphism ϕ+from K+={K,x} into G such that

	
ϕ+⁢(K+∩B)=ϕ+⁢(K+)∩B′.
	

Without loss of generality, we assume that the element x is not in K, but that px is in K, and that among the elements of the coset x+K, the element x has maximal height in G. (Such an element is called a proper element with respect to K.) There is no problem at all in exchanging representatives of the coset x+K, but we must verify that the coset x+K does indeed have an element of greatest height; it does because K is a finite extension of a direct summand Gβ of G. Let h⁢(x) denote the height of x, and let h⁢(x)=n. If h⁢(p⁢(x+k))>n+1 for some k∈K∩pn⁢G, we assume that h⁢(p⁢x)>n+1; in other words, if among the elements of the coset x+K that are proper with respect to K there exists y such that h⁢(p⁢y)>n+1, then we choose x to have this property. First we shall consider the other case. Case 1. h⁢(px)=n+1. There are two subcases. Subcase A. x+k∈B for some k∈K. Choose y0∈pn⁢G so that ϕ⁢(px)=py0; this is possible, since ϕ preserves heights. If y0+ϕ⁢(k)⁢ϵ⁢B′, set y=y0. If y0+ϕ⁢(k)∉B′, observe that p⁢(y0+ϕ⁢(k))=ϕ⁢(p⁢(x+k))⁢ϵ⁢pB′, and let y0+ϕ⁢(k)=b′+t, where b′⁢ϵ⁢B′ and pt=0. Since B′ is a basic subgroup of G, we can write t=c′+z, where c′⁢ϵ⁢B′⁢[p] and z⁢ϵ⁢pn+1⁢G⁢[p]. Set y=y0-z. Then y+ϕ⁢(k)∈B′. Extend ϕ by mapping x onto y.

Subcase B. x+k∈B for no k∈K. Choose y0∈pn⁢G so that ϕ⁢(px)=py0. If y0+ϕ⁢(k)∉B′ for all k∈K, let y=y0. If y0+ϕ⁢(k)∈B′ for some k∈K, consider p⁢(x+k). The homomorphism ϕ maps p⁢(x+k) onto p⁢(y0+ϕ⁢(k))∈p⁢B′. Hence

190 PAUL HILL p⁢(x+k)∈pB. Write x+k=b+s, where b∈B and ps=0. Now s∉{B,K}; otherwise, Subcase B would be voided. We claim that there exists t∈G⁢[p] such that t∉{B′,L}. First, notice that this is certainly the case if K=Gβ(=L), for by the induction hypothesis, G/{B,Gβ}≅G/{B′,Gβ}. Since {B,Gβ} and {B′,Gβ} are pure subgroups of G, it follows that

	
{𝐆⁢[𝐩],𝐁,𝐆β}/{𝐁,𝐆β}≅{𝐆⁢[𝐩],𝐁′,𝐆β}/{𝐁′,𝐆β}.
	

The isomorphism ϕ:K>⟶L induces an isomorphism

	
{B,𝐊}/{B,𝐆β}≫{B′,L}/{B′,𝐆β}⁢. 
	

Thus

	
{𝐆[𝐩],𝐁,𝐆β}/{{𝐁,𝐊}[𝐩],𝐁,𝐆β}≅{G[𝐩],𝐁′,𝐆β}/{𝐁′,𝐋}[𝐩],𝐁′,𝐆β},
	

and since the left-hand side is not zero, it follows that

	
{𝐆⁢[𝐩],𝐁′,𝐆β}≠{{𝐁′,𝐋}⁢[p],𝐁′,𝐆β}⁢. 
	

Therefore, there exists t∈G⁢[p] such that t∉{B′,L}. Choose b′∈B′ [p] so that t-b′∈pn+1⁢G. Define y=y0+t-b′, and note that y&{B′,L}. Thus y+ϕ⁢(k)∉B′ for all k∈K. Extend ϕ by mapping x onto y. Case 2. h⁢(px)>n+1. Again, there are two subcases. Subcase A. x+k∈B for some k∈K. Choose w∈pn+1⁢G so that pw=ϕ⁢(px). By the usual argument, some z∈G⁢[p] is proper with respect to L and has height exactly n. Set y0=w+z. If y0+ϕ⁢(k)∈B′, let y=y0. If y0+ϕ⁢(k)∉B′, define y in terms of y0 exactly as in Case 1 , Subcase A. Extend ϕ by mapping x onto y. Subcase B. x+k∉B for all k∈K. Define y0 in the same way as in the preceding case, y0=w+z. If y0+ϕ⁢(k)⁢ϵ⁢B′ for no k⁢ϵ⁢K, let y=y0. If yo +ϕ⁢(k)∈B for some k∈K, observe that ϕ⁢(p⁢(x+k))∈pB′. Hence p⁢(x+k)∈p⁢B. Write x+k=b+s, where b∈B and ps=0. Since s∉{K,B}, there exists t∈G⁢[p] such that t∉{L,B′}; the argument is the same as in Case 1 , Subcase B. Again, we let y=y0+t-b′, where b′∈B′⁢[p] and t-b′∈pn+1⁢G⁢[p]. Extend ϕ by mapping x onto y.

In all four cases, the extension ϕ+of ϕ to K+={K,x} is a height-preserving isomorphism from K+into G such that ϕ+⁢(K+∩B)=ϕ+⁢(K+)∩B′. This completes the secondary induction, and it is actually all we need to complete the first-stage induction. The argument that this suffices to finish the first-stage induction is outlined below.

Since each of the summands in the ∑-summations involved in conditions (1) to (5) is either finite or countably infinite, we can take ascending sequences

	
𝐆β=K0⊆K1⊆⋯⊆Kn⊆⋯
	

and

	
𝐆β=L0⊆L1⊆⋯⊆Ln⊆⋯

THE COVERING THEOREM FOR UPPER BASIC SUBGROUPS 191 (ϕn+1 extends ϕn) and have the property ϕn⁢(Kn∩B)=Ln∩B′. Furthermore, if we let Gγ=⋃n=Un, then we can choose the groups Kn and Ln so that conditions (1) to (5) hold for α=γ, where I⁢(γ) and J⁢(γ) are countable extensions of I⁢(β) and J⁢(β), respectively. (For a discussion of the details on how to do this, see [5]; the technique involved is sometimes referred to as the back-and-forth method of Hill and Megibben.) We can meet the final requirement, condition (6), by letting h∈K1∩L1, for then condition (1) implies that β∈I⁢(γ). Let πγ=sup⁡{ϕn}. Since we have retained the important condition πγ⁢(Gγ∩B)=Gγ∩B′, the first-stage induction goes through, and we thereby obtain an automorphism of G that maps B onto B ′.","Theorem 2.5. Let M be a Q⁢T⁢A⁢G-module and M=M0+U where U is a direct sum of uniserial modules. For a basic submodule B0 of M0, suppose B=B0+A and B′=B0+A′ be two basic submodules of M. Then there exists an automorphism f of M which is identity on M0 and maps B onto B′ if and only if

	
M/(M0+B)=M/(M0+B′)
	

Proof. Since U is a direct sum of uniserial modules both A and A′ are isomorphic to basic submodules of U and A≅U≅A′. Let U=∑xi⁢R,A=∑yi⁢R,A′=∑zi⁢R. Since M/B is h-divisible, M/(M0+B) is h-divisible, we may write M/(M0+B)=∑j∈JDj and M/(M0+B′)=∑j∈JDj′ where Dj ’s and Dj′ ’s are hdivisible. Since M0+B and M0+B′ are pure submodules of M we set, I={α∣α is an ordinal of cardinality less then g(U)} J={α∣α is an ordinal of cardinality less then g(M/(M0+B))}. If J is empty then M0+A=M=M0+A′ and the required automorphism of M may be obtained by mapping A isomorphically onto A′. On comparing U≅M/M0 and M/(M0+B), we may say that J⊆I. Since a bounded module cannot have a proper basic submodule, the finiteness of I implies that M0+A=M0+A′, therefore we assume that I is infinite.

Let f0 denote the identity map of M0. Suppose that for every γ∈I and α<γ there exists a submodule Mα of M and a height preserving automorphism fα of Mα

98 A. MEHDI AND M.Y. ABBASI such that Mα⊂Mβ and fβ∣Mα=fα whenever α<β<γ and fα⁢(Mα∩B)=Mα∩B′. With these assumptions the following conditions would be satisfied for suitable subsets Iα⊂I and Jα⊂J. Here Mα etc. are not the αth  Ulm factors of M.

	
Mα=M0+∑Iαxi⁢R,Mα∩B=B0+∑Iαyi⁢R,Mα∩B′=B0+∑Iαzi⁢R
(Mα+B)/(M0+B)=∑JαDj⁢ and ⁢(Mα+B′)/(M0+B′)=∑JαDj′
	

For any limit ordinal γ,Mγ=⋃α<γMα and fγ denotes the automorphism of Mγ with fγ∣Mα=fα for all α<γ. Again Iγ=⋃α<γIα and Jγ=⋃α<γJα. If γ-1 exists then put β=γ-1 and consider the extensions K and L of Mβ such that g⁢(K/Mβ) and g⁢(L/Mβ) are finite and ψ:K→L is a height preserving isomorphism such that ψ⁢(K∩B)=L∩B′.

We have to extend ψ to a height preserving automorphism fγ of a submodule Mγ containing K and L such that the above conditions hold for α⩽γ and fγ⁢(Mγ∩B)= Mγ∩B′. Moreover if α+1<γ then α∈Iα+1. Consider an element x∉K. Now we may extend ψ to a height preserving isomorphism ψ′ from K′=K+x⁢R into M such that ψ′⁢(K′∩B)=ψ′⁢(K′)∩B′.

We may consider an element x∉K for which ∃y∈K such that d⁢(x⁢Ry⁢R)=1 and x is a proper element with respect to K. To verify this suppose H⁢(x)=n. If H⁢(y+k)>n+1 for some k∈K∩Hn⁢(M), we assume that H⁢(y)⩾n+1. If H⁢(y)=n+1 and x+k∈B for some k∈K we may choose u∈Hn⁢(M) such that ψ⁢(y)=v where d⁢(u⁢Rv⁢R)=1. If u+ψ⁢(k)∈B′ we may set ψ′⁢(x)=u, otherwise consider u′,x′ such that d⁢((u+ψ⁢(k))⁢Ru′⁢R)=1 and d⁢((x+k)⁢Rx′⁢R)=1. Now u′=ψ⁢(x′)∈H1⁢(B′). Let u+ψ⁢(k)=b′+a′ where b′∈B′ and e⁢(a′)=1. Since B′ is a basic submodule of M, we may express a′=c′+w where c′∈Soc⁡(B′) and w∈Soc⁡(Hn+1⁢(M)). Now u-w+ψ⁢(k)∈B′. We extend ψ by mapping x onto u-w.

If x+k∉B for any k∈K we choose u∈Hn⁢(M) such that ψ⁢(y)=v where d⁢(u⁢Rv⁢R)=1. If u+ψ⁢(k)∉B′ for all k∈K we put ψ′⁢(x)=u, othewrwise u+ψ⁢(k)∈B′ for some k∈K. Consider x′ such that d⁢((x+k)⁢Rx′⁢R)=1. Now ψ⁢(x′)=u′∈H1⁢(B′), where d⁢((u+ψ⁢(k))⁢Ru′⁢R)=1. Hence x′∈H1⁢(B).

We may express x′ as b+a where b∈B and e⁢(a)=1. Now a∉B+K otherwise x+k∈B. Now we show that Soc⁡(M) is not contained in B′+L. If K=Mβ=L then by induction hypothesis M/(B+Mβ)≅M/(B′+Mβ). Since B+Mβ and B′+Mβ

UPPER BASIC AND CONGRUENT SUBMODULES OF QTAG-MODULES 99 are h-pure submodules of M, it follows that

	
(Soc⁡(M)+B+Mβ)/(B+Mβ)≅(Soc⁡(M)+B′+Mβ)/(B′+Mβ)
	

and the isomorphism ψ:K→L induces an isomorphism

	
(B+K)/(B+Mβ)→(B′+L)/(B′+Mβ)
	

Thus

	(Soc(M)+B	+Mβ)/(B+Mβ+Soc(B+K))	
		≅(Soc⁡(M)+B′+Mβ)/(B′+Mβ+Soc⁡(B′+L)).	

Since the left hand side is nonzero

	
(Soc⁡(M)+B′+Mβ)≠(Soc⁡(B′+L)+B′+Mβ)
	

⇒∃z∈Soc⁡(M) such that z∉B′+L. We may select b1∈Soc⁡(B′) so that z-b1∈ Hn+1⁢(M). We now define ψ′⁢(x)=u+z-b1∉B′+L. Thus u+z-b1+ψ⁢(k)∉B′ for every k∈K and ψ′ is the extension of ψ.

If H⁢(y)>n+1 and x+k∈B for some k∈K. We select w∈Hn+1⁢(M) such that w′=ψ⁢(y) where d⁢(w⁢Rw′⁢R)=1. This implies that ∃z∈Soc⁡(M) which is proper with respect to L and H⁢(z)=n. Put u=w+z. If u+ψ⁢(k)∈B′ we may define ψ′⁢(x)=u. If u+ψ⁢(k)∉B′ then ψ′⁢(x) is defined as in the previous case.

On the other hand if x+k∉B for all k∈K, then we define u=w+z as in the preceeding case. If u+ψ⁢(k)∉B′ for any k∈K, we put ψ′⁢(x)=u. If u+ψ⁢(k)∈B for some k,ψ⁢(x′)∈H1⁢(B′) where d⁢((x+k)⁢Rx′⁢R)=1. Therefore x′∈H1⁢(B). Now x+k=b+c where b∈B,e⁢(c)=1. Since c∉K+B,∃d∈Soc⁡(M) such that d∉L+B′. We put ψ′⁢(x)=u+d-b′, where b′∈Soc⁡(B′) and d-b′∈Soc⁡(Hn+1⁢(M)). In all the above four cases ψ′ is an extension of ψ to K+x⁢R which is a height preserving isomorphism from K+x⁢R into M such that ψ′((K+xR)∩B)=ψ′(K+ xR)∩B′

Since B is a basic submodule, g⁢(B) is not uncountable. Moreover I(α) ’s and J(α) ’s are also finite or countable. We may consider the ascending sequences

	
Mβ=K0⊆K1⊆⋯⊆Kn⊆⋯
Mβ=L0⊆L1⊆⋯⊆Ln⊆⋯
	

such that g⁢(KiMβ) and g⁢(LiMβ) are finite for all i,∪Kn=∪Ln and there exists a sequence ψn:Kn→Ln of height preserving isomorphisms such that ψn is the extension of ψn-1 and ψn⁢(Kn∩B)=Ln∩B′. If we put Mγ=U⁢Kn=U⁢Ln, then we may choose the modules Kn and Ln so that the previously mentioned five conditions hold for α=γ. Here Iγ and Jγ are the countable extensions of Iβ and Jβ

100 A. MEHDI AND M.Y. ABBASI respectively. Now β∈Jγ. Let fγ be the maximum extension of ψn i.e. fγ=sup⁡{ψn}, fγ⁢(Mγ∩B)=Mγ∩B′ and we obtain an automorphism of M that maps B onto B′.",0223.20057.tex,1221.16003.tex,Substitutions; Formula Manipulation; Math-to-Text; Text-to-Math; Paraphrase; Variation of subject; Deletions; Different Presentation

Proof. Let B0=B∩G0. Then B/B0 is isomorphic to a subgroup of H. Since H is a direct sum of cyclic groups, B/B0 is a direct sum of cyclic groups, and since B0 is pure, it follows that B=B0+A for some A⊆B. Since

This suggests that we consider triples (π,M,N) where M and N are nice subgroups of G and π:M⟶N is an isomorphism satisfying the following two conditions: (1) π preserves heights in G (i.e., hG⁢(π⁢(m))=hG⁢(m) for all mεM). (2) π⁢(m)+k=ϕ⁢(m+H) for all m∈M. of course, we shal1 certainly need some further condition taking advantage of the fact that H and K have the same U1m invariants; namely, we also require for each v<λ the condition (3) If sv⁢ε⁢Sv and m⁢ε⁢M, then hG⁢(sv+m)>v if and only if hG⁢(μv⁢(sv)+π⁢(m))>v. Let θ denote the class of all such triples satisfying (1), (2) and (3). The crucial step in building up the desired automorphism ψ is the following proposition which insures that we can always make finite enlargements of triples in Θ.

PROPOSITION. If (π,M,N) is a triple in θ and if x∈G, then there is a triple (π′,M′,N′) in θ where M′=⟨M,x⟩ and π′∣M=π.

There is no loss in generality in supposing that p⁢x⁢ε⁢M and, since M is nice in G, that x is proper with respect to M (i.e., hG⁢(x+m)≤hG⁢(x) for all m⁢ε⁢M ). Let α= hG⁢(x). By well-known arguments, if we can find y⁢ε⁢G such that (i) hG⁢(y)=α, (ii) p⁢y=π⁢(p⁢x), (iii) y is proper with respect to N and (iv) ϕ⁢(x+H)=y+K, then we obtain an isomorphism π′ of M′=⟨M,x⟩ onto N′=⟨N,y⟩ that extends π and satisfies (1) and (2) by taking π′⁢(x)=y. Moreover M′ and N′ will be nice subgroups of G since each is a finite extension of a nice subgroup. Thus if such a y can be found, we need only check that the condition (3) is also satisfied by π′. But then clearly we need only verify that

	
hG⁢(sv+x+m)>v⁢ if and only if ⁢hG⁢(μv⁢(sv)+y+π⁢(m))>v
	

for all sv⁢ε⁢sv and all m⁢ε⁢M. Notice, however, that neither of these inequalities can hold for v>α since hG⁢(x+m)=hG⁢(y+π⁢(m))≤α for all m⁢ε⁢M. Indeed only the case ν= α can present any difficulty since if ν⟨α, then hG(sν+x+m)⟩v if and only if hG⁢(sν+m)>ν. Consequently, if we can find a y satisfying (i)-(iv), we need only verify that y also satisfies for all sα⁢ε⁢sα and all m⁢ε⁢M the condtion (v) hG⁢(sα+x+m)>α if and only if hG⁢(μα⁢(sα)+y+π⁢(m))>α.

516 The proof of our proposition divides itself naturally into two distinct cases. Case I: hG⁢(p⁢x)>α+1 and hG/H⁢(x+H)>α. Since pα+1⁢(G/K)=pα+1⁢G+K/K and hG/K⁢(ϕ⁢(x+H))=hG/H⁢(x+H)>α, we can choose w⁢ε⁢pα+1⁢G such that w+K=ϕ⁢(x+H). Then by (2), p⁢w-π⁢(p⁢x)⁢ε⁢K∩pα+2⁢G=pα+2⁢K and therefore we have a k⁢ε⁢pα+1⁢k such that p⁢(w+k)= π⁢(p⁢x). Hence replacing w by w+k, we may assume that we also have p⁢w=π⁢(p⁢x). Since hG/H⁢(x+H)>α and pα+1(G/H)=pα+1+GH/H, we have hG⁢(x+h)≥α+1 for some h⁢ε⁢H. Then hG⁢(h)=hG⁢(x)=α and hG⁢(p⁢h)>α+1 since hG⁢(p⁢x)>α+1. Thus pα+2⁢G∩H=pα+2⁢H implies that ph=ph′ for some h′⁢εp⁢pα+1⁢H and therefore h′⁢h′⁢ε⁢(pα⁢H)⁢[p]=sα⁢𝜽α⁢(pα+1)⁢[p]. It follows then than there is a v⁢ε⁢pα+1⁢G such that ssαx=x-v⁢ε⁢Sα. We take y=(sαx)m+μα. Clearly y satisfies (i), (ii) and (iv). Notice that 𝐬αx is proper with respect to M since x is and vεpα+1G. But then (3) implies that μα⁢(sαx) is proper with respect to N=π⁢(M) and hence y itself is proper with respect to N since w⁢ε⁢pα+1⁢G. It remains only to verify (v). This last condition, however, is guaranteed by the special form of x and y. Indeed hG⁢(sα+x+m)>α if and only if hG⁢(sαx+sαx+m)>α and hG⁢(μα⁢(sαx)+y+π⁢(m)) >α if and only if hG(μα(sα+sαx)+π)(m))>α; that is, (v) holds since π satisfies (3). The second case in the proof of our proposition is greatly expedited by the following technical observation.

LEMMA. Suppose y ε⁢G satisfies (i), (ii) and (iv). If sα⁢ε⁢Sα and m⁢ε⁢M are such that at least one of the inequalities in (v) holds, then x′=x+m has height α, hG⁢(p⁢x′)>α+1 and hG/H⁢(x′+H)>α. PROOF. With the hypotheses on π and y, it is easy to see that either of the inequalities in (v) implies that hG⁢(m)≥α and hG⁢(p⁢(x+m))>α+1; that is, x′= x+m satisfies the first two conditions. The other follows from the facts that hG/H⁢(x′+H)=hG/K⁢(ϕ⁢(x′+H))=hG/K⁢(y+π⁢(m)+K),hG/H⁢(x′+H)≥hG⁢(sα+x+m) and hG/K⁢(y+π⁢(m)+k) ≥hG⁢(μα⁢(sα)+y+π⁢(m)). Case II: hG⁢(p⁢x)=α+1 or hG/H⁢(x+H)=α. Since pα⁢(G/K)=pα⁢G+K/K, we can certainly choose w⁢ε⁢pα⁢G such that w+K=ϕ⁢(x+H). Similar to Case I, there will be a k⁢ε⁢pα⁢k such that p⁢(w+k)=π⁢(px). This time we simply take y=w+k so that at least (ii) and (iv) are satisfied. Since hG⁢(p⁢x)=hG⁢(π⁢(p⁢x))=hG⁢(p⁢y) and hG/H⁢(x+H)= hG/K⁢(ϕ⁢(x+H))=hG/K⁢(y+K), either of the conditions defining this case force (i)⁢hG⁢(y)= α. Next we observe that if y fails to be proper with respect to N=π⁢(M), then we can return to Case I. Indeed if hG⁢(y+π⁢(m))>α for some m⁢ε⁢M, then by our lemma we can replace x by x′=x+m and apply Case I to x′. Thus we may assume that y also satisfies (iii) and it remains only to deal with (v). But if either of the inequalities in (v) holds for some sα⁢ε⁢sα and m⁢ε⁢M, then once again our lemma allows us to replace x by x′=x+m and return to Case I. Therefore we may assume that neither of these inequalities hold for any sα and m, and hence that y satisfies (v) vacuously

517 We are now in position to give the proof of our theorem. Up to this point we have made no use of the assumption that G is totally projective. There are, of course, many characterizations of totally projectives, but the most convenient for our purposes is the following: The reduced p-group G is totally projective if and only if there is a family 𝒞 of nice subgroups of G such that (α) of 𝒞;(β)⁢𝒞 is closed under the union of chains; and (Y) if S⁢E⁢𝒞 and A is a subgroup of G such that A/S is countable, then there is a B∈𝒞 such that B/A is countable.

Now take Ψ to be that subfamily of θ consisting of all triples (π,M,N) such that M=N⁢ε⁢𝒞. Then Ψ is a partially ordered set in the obvious manner and (Y ) allows us to apply Zorn’s 1emma to obtain a maximal member ( ψ,M,M) of Ψ. Clearly then ψ will be the desired automorphism of G provided we can argue that M=G. Indeed supposing M≠G, a succession of applications of (γ) and our proposition yields via a back-andforth, interlacing argument (see [7] for the details) a sequence {(πn,An,Bn)} in θ of finite extensions of (ψ,M,M) such that πn+1∣An=πn for each n and

	
C=⋃n=1∞An=⋃n=1∞Bn=⋃n=1∞Cn
	

where each Cn is in 𝒞. But C∈𝒞 by (β) and if π is the union of the πn⁢s′, then (π,c,c) is a member of Ψ contradicting the maximality of (ψ,M,M) since π∣M=ψ. We close with a couple of remarks. First observe that our proof carries over to the case where H and K are almost balanced in totally projectives G and G′, respectively, with G/H≅G′/K; in which case, we obtain an isomorphism ψ of G onto G′ with ψ⁢(H)=K. Thus taking trivial quotients, we obtain yet another proof of the fact that totally projectives are determined up to isomorphism by their Ulm invariants. More noteworthy is the fact that Proposition 2.11 in [6] implies that for each pgroup A and each limit ordinal λ there exist a totally projective G of length λ and an almost balanced subgroup H such that G/H≅A.
","Theorem 3.1. Let N and K be almost balanced submodules of the totally projective Q⁢T⁢A⁢G-module M of limit length. If N and K have same Ulm invariants and M/N≅ M/K then N and K are congruent modulo M.

UPPER BASIC AND CONGRUENT SUBMODULES OF QTAG-MODULES 101 Proof. Consider the isomorphism f:M/N→M/K and direct decompositions Soc⁡(Hα⁢(N))=Soc⁡(Hα+1⁢(N))⊕Sα, Soc⁡(Hα⁢(K))=Soc⁡(Hα+1⁢(K))⊕Tα for every ordinal α<β, where β is the length of M. Since N and K have same Ulm invariants for all α<β, there exists an isomorphism ψα:Sα→Tα. As N and K are nice submodules [4] of M we consider triples (ϕ,C,D) such that C,D are nice submodules of M and ϕ:C→D is an isomorphism with the following conditions: (a) ϕ preserves heights in M, (b) ϕ⁢(x)+K=f⁢(x+N) for all x∈C. (c) If xλ∈Sλ and x∈C then HM⁢(x+xλ)>λ if and only if HM(ψλ(xλ)+ ϕ(x))>λ Let ℱ denote the class of all such triples satisfying (a) (b) and (c). Now we shall prove that if (ϕ,C,D)∈ℱ and if x∈M, then there is a triple (ϕ′,C′,D′)∈ℱ where C′=C+x⁢R and ϕ′∣C=ϕ. Since C is nice in M and x is the element of maximum height in the coset x+C ( x is proper with respect to C ) we may consider z∈C such that d⁢(x⁢R/z⁢R)=1. Let HM⁢(x)=α. We have to find y∈M such that, (i) HM⁢(y)=α, (ii) ϕ⁢(z)=y′ where d⁢(y⁢R/y′⁢R)=1, (iii) y is proper with respect to D and (iv) f⁢(x+N)=y+K. Then we obtain an isomorphism ϕ′:C′=(C+x⁢R)→D′=(D+y⁢R) which is an extension of ϕ and satisfies (a) and (b). Again C′,D′ are finite extensions of nice submodules hence they are nice submodules. If we can find such y, we have to verify (v), i.e. HM⁢(sα+x+c)>α if and only if HM⁢(ψ⁢(sα)+y+ϕ⁢(c))>α for all c∈C, sα∈Sα.

Case (i). When HM⁢(z)>α+1 and HM/N⁢(x+N)>α. Since Hα+1⁢(M/K)= (Hα+1⁢(M)+K)/K and HM/K⁢(f⁢(x+N))=HM/N⁢(x+N)>α, we may select u∈Hα+1⁢(M) such that u+K=f⁢(x+N) and f⁢(x+N)=ϕ⁢(x)+K. Consider u′ such that d⁢(u⁢R/u′⁢R)=1, then by condition (b) u′-ϕ⁢(z)∈K∩Hα+2⁢(M)=Hα+2⁢(K) and therefore we have v∈Hα+1⁢(K) such that ϕ⁢(z)=u′+w′ where d⁢((u+v)⁢R(u′+v′)⁢R)=1. Again replacing u′ by u′+w′ we have u′=ϕ⁢(z). Since HM/N⁢(x+N)>α and Hα+1⁢(M/N)=(Hα+1⁢(M)+N)/N we have HM⁢(x+x1)⩾α+1 for some x1∈N. Then HM⁢(x1)=HM⁢(x)=α and HM⁢(x1′)>α+1 where d⁢(x1⁢Rx1′⁢R)=1 and HM⁢(z)>α+1. Now Hα+2⁢(M)∩N=Hα+2⁢(N) implies that x1′=x2 for some x2∈Hα+1⁢(N),

	
⇒x1-x2′∈Soc⁡(Hα⁢(N))⁢ where ⁢d⁢(x2′⁢Rx2⁢R)=1,
⇒x1-x2′∈Sα⊕Soc⁡(Hα+1⁢(N))=Soc⁡(Hα⁢(N)),
⇒∃w∈Hα+1⁢(M)⁢ such that ⁢x-w∈Sα.
	

Put y=u+ψα⁢(x-w). Now y satisfies conditions (i),(ii) and (iv). Again x-w is proper with respect to C as w∈Hα+1⁢(M). But the condition (c) implies that ψα⁢(x-w) is proper with respect to D=ϕ⁢(C), therefore y is proper with respect to D

102 A. MEHDI AND M.Y. ABBASI because u∈Hα+1⁢(M). Now HM⁢(sα+x+c)>α if and only if HM⁢(sα+x-w+c)>α and HM⁢(ψα⁢(x-w)+y+ϕ⁢(c))>α if and only if HM⁢(ψα⁢(sα+x-w)+ϕ⁢(c))>α, ⇒ condition (iv) holds because ϕ satisfies (c).

Case (ii). When HM⁢(z)=α+1 or HM/N⁢(x+N)=α we have to show that if y satisfies (i),(ii) and (iv) and sα∈Sα and c∈C such that atleast one of the inequalities in (v) holds then x+c has height α,HM⁢(x′)>α+1,HM/N⁢(x+c+N)>α where d⁢((x+c)⁢Rx′⁢R)=1. The way ϕ and y are defined either of the inequalities in (v) implies that HM⁢(c)⩾α and HM⁢(x′)>α+1 i.e. x+C satisfies the first two conditions. Now, α=HM/N⁢(x+c+N)=HM/N⁢(f⁢(x+N))=HM/N⁢(y+ϕ⁢(c)+K)⩾HM⁢(ψα⁢(sα)+y+ϕ⁢(c)). Since Hα⁢(M/K)=(Hα⁢(M)+K)/K we may select w∈Hα⁢(M) such that w+ K=f⁢(x+N). Like case (i) there exists v∈Hα⁢(K) such that w′=ϕ⁢(z), here d⁢((w+v)⁢Rw′⁢R)=1. We select y=w+v so that (ii) and (iv) are satisfied. Since HM⁢(z)=HM⁢(ϕ⁢(z))=HM⁢(y′),(d⁢(y⁢Ry′⁢R)=1) and HM/N(x+N)=HM/K(f(x+ N))=HM/K(y+K). Either of the conditions defining this case implies, HM⁢(y)=α. If y fails to be proper with respect to D then we may go to case (i). Because if HM⁢(y+ϕ⁢(c))>α for some c∈C we may replace x by x+c and apply case (i) to x+c. It can be deduced now that y satisfies (iii). Again if either of the inequalities in (v) holds for some sα∈Sα and c∈C, then we replace x by x+c and return to case (i). This makes us assume that neither of these inequalities hold for any sα∈Sα and c∈C. This implies y satisfies (v).

Let 𝒜 be the subfamily of ℱ consisting of triples (ϕ,C,D) such that C and D are equal and nice. Now 𝒜 is partially ordered by the natural order. By Zorn’s lemma we may select the maximal member (ϕ,C,C)∈𝒜. We have to show that C=M, then ϕ would be desired automorphism. Applying the above arguments we may obtain a sequence (ϕi,Ci,Di) in ℱ which are extensions of (ϕ,C,C) such that ϕi+1∣Ci=ϕi, g⁢(Ci∣C),g⁢(Di/C) are finite and for every i,

	
A=⋃i=1∞Ci=⋃i=1∞Di=⋃i=1∞Ai⁢ where ⁢Ai∈ℬ
	

where ℬ is a family of nice submodules of M such that {0}∈ℬ,ℬ is closed under the union of chains and for every M1∈ℬ and M2⊂M1 such that M1/M2 is countably generated then ∃M3∈ℬ with countably generated M3/M2.

If A∈ℬ then (ψ,A,A) is a member of 𝒜(ψ being the extension of ϕi ’s) contradicting the maximality of (ϕ,C,C) as ψ/A=ϕ. This implies that ϕ is the required automorphism. Remark If N,K are almost balanced submodules of totally projective modules M and M′ with M/N≅M′/K, we may obtain an isomorphism ϕ:M→M′ with

"1. INTRODUCTION Let Ω be a bounded polyhedral domain in ℝd and consider the problem (1.1) ut+A⁢u=0  in Ω, for t>0 with u=g  on ∂⁡Ω, for t≥0,u⁢(0)=v  in Ω. Here

	
A⁢u=-∑k,l=1d∂∂⁡xk⁢(ak⁢l⁢∂⁡u∂⁡xl)+∑k=1dbk⁢∂⁡u∂⁡xk,
	

where the coefficients ak⁢l,bk∈ℂ1⁢(Ω¯), and (ak⁢l⁢(x)) is a symmetric and uniformly positive definite matrix on Ω¯.

The maximum principle for (1.1) asserts that, if QT=Ω×(0,T), with T>0, the maximum and the minumum of a solution u∈ℂ2⁢(QT)∩ℂ⁢(Q¯T) over Q¯T occur on the parabolic boundary, (∂⁡Ω×[0,T])∪(Ω×{t=0}). As a consequence of this we find at once a bound for |u| in QT, namely (1.2) ∥u∥QT=max⁡(∥g∥∂⁡Ω×[0,T],∥v∥Ω), where ∥u∥V=maxV¯⁡|u|.

12 V. THOMÉE AND L.B. WAHLBIN Since constant functions satisfy the differential equation in (1.1), it is well known and easy to prove that (1.2) is equivalent to the positivity condition (1.3) u≥0  in QT, if v≥0  in Ω and g≥0 on ∂⁡Ω×[0,T]. In the case of homogeneous Dirichlet boundary conditions, i.e., when g=0, it follows from (1.2) that the solution operator E⁢(t), the semigroup defined by u⁢(t)= E⁢(t)⁢v on the continuous functions which vanish on ∂⁡Ω, is a contraction, or (1.4) ∥E⁢(t)⁢v∥≤∥v∥, for t≥0. We shall be concerned with spatially semidiscrete approximations of (1.1) based on continuous, piecewise linear finite elements, defined on a family of triangulations 𝒯h={τ} of Ω¯ into closed simplices τ, such that any face of any τ is either a subset of the boundary ∂⁡Ω or a face of another τ∈𝒯h. We set h=maxτ∈𝒯h⁡diam⁡(τ). We associate with 𝒯h the finite dimensional spaces Sh={χ∈𝒞(Ω¯):χ|τ linear for τ∈𝒯h} and Sh0={χ∈Sh:χ=0 on ∂Ω}. For each t, let gh⁢(t) be the restriction to ∂⁡Ω of a function in Sh and let vh∈Sh with vh=gh⁢(0) on ∂⁡Ω. The semidiscrete standard Galerkin finite element problem associated with (1.1) is then to find uh⁢(t)∈Sh for t≥0 such that (1.5) (uh,t,χ)+A⁢(uh,χ)=0,∀χ∈Sh0,t>0, with uh⁢(t)=gh⁢(t)  on ∂⁡Ω, for t≥0, and uh⁢(0)=vh, where (f,g)=∫Ωf⁢(x)⁢g⁢(x)⁢𝑑x and, with b¯=(b1,…,bd)T,

	
A⁢(f,g)=∫Ω(∑k,l=1dak⁢l⁢∂⁡f∂⁡xl⁢∂⁡g∂⁡xk+∑k=1dbk⁢∂⁡f∂⁡xk⁢g)⁢𝑑x=A0⁢(f,g)+(b¯⋅∇⁡f,g).
	

It is natural to ask whether an analogue of the maximum principle (1.2) holds for the discrete problem (1.5), or whether (1.6) ∥uh∥QT=max⁡(∥gh∥∂⁡Ω×[0,T],∥vh∥Ω). We shall demonstrate below that, in general, this is not the case. In Fujii [2] it was shown, for special families of triangulations 𝒯h with all angles acute, that the backward Euler method may satisfy a maximum principle. His result requires a certain lower bound for the time step and therefore does not imply the same for the semidiscrete method by letting the time step tend to 0 .

As a preparation for our analysis we express the semidiscrete problem (1.5) in matrix form: Let {Pi}i=1n denote the nodes of 𝒯h in the interior of Ω, and {Pn+i}i=1m those on ∂⁡Ω, and let {Φi}i=1n+m⊂Sh be the standard basis of pyramid functions defined by Φi⁢(Pj)=δi⁢j. The mass and stiffness matrices are then ℳ=(mi⁢j) and 𝒮=(si⁢j), where mi⁢j=(Φi,Φj) and si⁢j=A⁢(Φi,Φj),i,j=1:n. To include the boundary terms, we also set ℬ=(bi⁢j) and 𝒵=(zi⁢j) with bi⁢j= A(Φi,Φn+j),zi⁢j=(Φi,Φn+j),i=1:n,j=1:m. We now also introduce the vector α⁢(t)=(α1⁢(t),…,αn⁢(t))T of nodal values of uh⁢(t) and correspondingly g~⁢(t)= (g~n+1⁢(t),…,g~n+m⁢(t))T, where g~j⁢(t)=gh⁢(Pj,t) and v~=(vh⁢(P1),…,vh⁢(Pn))T. Thus uh⁢(t)=∑i=1nαi⁢(t)⁢Φi+∑j=1mg~n+j⁢(t)⁢Φn+j, and we may hence write (1.5) as

	
ℳ⁢d⁢αd⁢t+𝒮⁢α=-ℬ⁢g~-𝒵⁢d⁢g~d⁢t, for ⁢t≥0, with ⁢α⁢(0)=v~⁢.

MAXIMUM PRINCIPLES IN PARABOLIC FINITE ELEMENT EQUATIONS 13 Since the last term in (1.7) cannot be bounded by ∥gh∥∂⁡Ω×[0,T], it is already now clear that the full discrete maximum principle (1.6) cannot hold.

We now introduce the discrete semigroup Eh⁢(t) on Sh0 by setting Eh⁢(t)⁢vh=uh⁢(t), where uh⁢(t) is the solution of (1.5) with boundary data gh⁢(t)=0. It has been shown by specific counterexamples (see, e.g., [6], Chapter 6) that Eh⁢(t) does not generally satisfy the analogue of (1.4), (1.8) ∥Eh⁢(t)⁢vh∥≤∥vh∥, for t≥0. Our first goal in this paper is to show that, in fact, (1.8) cannot hold for any triangulation 𝒯h which is ”fine” enough. We continue to show that Eh⁢(t) cannot be positive in the sense that Eh⁢(t)⁢vh≥0 if vh≥0. Thus in neither case (1.6) can be valid. These results will be shown in Section 2 below. For weaker maximum-norm stability estimates than (1.8), see [6] and references therein.

We now turn to the lumped mass method, which results from replacing the mass matrix ℳ in (1.7) by a diagonal matrix 𝒟 with diagonal elements di⁢i=∑j=1nmi⁢j and also setting 𝒵=0, or

	
𝒟⁢d⁢αd⁢t+𝒮⁢α=-ℬ⁢g~, for ⁢t≥0, with ⁢α⁢(0)=v~
	

This may also be written in variational form, replacing the inner product in (1.5) by a quadrature approximation, or (1.10) (uh,t,χ)h+A⁢(uh,χ)=0,∀χ∈Sh0,t>0 with uh⁢(t)=gh⁢(t)  on ∂⁡Ω, for t≥0, and uh⁢(0)=vh, where

	
(ψ,χ)h=∑τ∈𝒯hQτ,h⁢(ψ⁢χ),Qτ,h⁢(f)=meas⁡(τ)d+1⁢∑Pj∈τ¯f⁢(Pj)≈∫τf⁢𝑑x.
	

In this lumped mass case, to be discussed in Section 3 below, we shall show that the discrete maximum principle (1.6) holds if and only if the off-diagonal elements of the stiffness matrix 𝒮 are nonpositive and if ℬ≤0, elementwise. In one space dimension, this is always the case. In two space dimensions, with A= -Δ, this is equivalent to the condition that each edge of 𝒯h, not entirely on ∂⁡Ω, is of Delauney type, in the sense that the sums of the opposing angles in the two triangles containing it are at most π. In fact, if Pi and Pj are neighbors, i.e., if Pi⁢Pj is an edge of 𝒯h, and if α and β are the angles opposite Pi⁢Pj, then (∇Φi,∇Φj)=-sin(α+β)/(4sinαsinβ)<0,=0, or >0 when α+β<π,=π, or >π, respectively; see, e.g., Strang and Fix [5. p. 78], Xu and Zikatanov 7.

14 V. THOMÉE AND L.B. WAHLBIN The maximum principle for (1.11), or

	
∥wh∥Ω≤∥gh∥∂⁡Ω,
	

is now equivalent to the positivity condition α≥0 for g~≥0, and hence, by (1.12), 𝒮-1⁢ℬ≤0 is necessary and sufficient for (1.13).

Consider now the discrete parabolic problem (1.10) with vh=0 at interior nodes and gh⁢(t)=gh= constant in time, and assume that A⁢(χ,χ) is positive definite on Sh0 and the maximum principle holds for (1.10). The solution of (1.10) then converges to the solution of (1.11) as t→∞, and (1.13) thus also holds for the discrete stationary problem. Hence 𝒮-1⁢ℬ≤0 is a necessary condition for (1.6) in this case.

In two dimensions and with A=-Δ, by the results already mentioned, under Delauney conditions on 𝒯h, we have 𝒮-1≥0 and ℬ≤0 and hence (1.13) holds. In Ruas Santos [4] examples were given of triangulations of non-Delauney type, for which the elliptic maximum principle still holds. In ℝ3, Korotov, Křízeek, and Neittaanmäki [3 showed an elliptic maximum principle for tetrahedral decompositions of nonacute type. (For certain convection dominated elliptic cases, cf. 77) and references therein.) Thus the parabolic maximum principle demands more stringent conditions than (1.13). In Section 3 we also discuss conditions for contractivity and positivity of the solution operator E¯h⁢(t) on Sh0.","1. Introduction Let Ω be a bounded polyhedral domain in ℝd and consider the problem

	
ut+A⁢u=0  in ⁢Ω, for ⁢t>0,
	

with u=g  on ∂⁡Ω, for t⩾0,u⁢(0)=v  in Ω. Here

	
A⁢u=-∑k,l=1d∂∂⁡xk⁢(ak⁢l⁢∂⁡u∂⁡xl)+∑k=1dbk⁢∂⁡u∂⁡xk
	

where the coefficients ak⁢l,bk∈Cd⁢(Ω¯), and (ak⁢l⁢(x)) is a symmetric and uniformly positive definite matrix on Ω¯. The maximum principle for (1.1) asserts that, if QT=Ω×(0,T), with T>0, the maximum and the minumum of a solution u∈C2⁢(QT)∩C⁢(Q¯T) over Q¯T occur on the parabolic boundary, (∂⁡Ω×[0,T])∪(Ω×{t=0}). As a consequence of this we find at once a bound for |u| in QT, namely (1.2) ∥u∥QT=max⁡(∥g∥∂⁡Ω×[0,T],∥v∥Ω), where ∥u∥V=maxV¯⁡|u|. Here V denotes a set in ℝd or ℝd+1; when V=Ω we normally omit this subscript. Since constant functions satisfy the differential equation in (1.1), it is well 2000 Mathematics Subject Classification.

62 M. ALMAHAMEED known and easy to prove that (1.2) is equivalent to the positivity condition (1.3) u⩾0 in QT, if v⩾0 in Ω and g⩾0 on ∂⁡Ω×[0,T]. In the case of homogeneous Dirichlet boundary conditions, i.e., when g=0, it follows from (1.2) that for the solution operator E⁢(t), the semigroup defined by u⁢(t)=E⁢(t)⁢v on the continuous functions which vanish on ∂⁡Ω, is a contraction, or (1.4) ∥E⁢(t)⁢v∥⩽∥v∥, for t⩾0. We shall be concerned with spatially semidiscrete approximations of (1.1) based on continuous, piecewise linear finite elements, defined on a family of triangulations Υh={τ} of Ω¯ into closed simplices τ, such that any face of any τ is either a subset of the boundary ∂⁡Ω or a face of another τ∈Υh. We set h=maxτ∈Υh⁡diam⁡(τ). We associate with Υh the finite dimensional spaces Sh={χ∈C(Ω¯):χ|τ linear for τ∈Υh} and Sh0={χ∈Sh:χ=0 on ∂Ω}. For each t, let gh⁢(t) be the restriction to ∂⁡Ω of a function in Sh and let vh∈Sh with vh=gh⁢(0) on ∂⁡Ω. The semidiscrete standard Galerkin finite element problem associated with (1.1) is then to find uh⁢(t)∈Sh for t⩾0 such that

	
(uh,t,χ)+A⁢(uh,χ)=0,∀χ∈Sh0,t>0,
	

with uh⁢(t)=gh⁢(t)  on ∂⁡Ω, for t⩾0, and uh⁢(0)=vh, where (f,g)=∫Ωf⁢(x)⁢g⁢(x)⁢𝑑x,b¯=(b1,…,bd)T, and

	
A(f,g)=∫Ω(∑k,l=1dak⁢l∂⁡f∂⁡xl∂⁡g∂⁡xk+∑k=1dbk∂⁡f∂⁡xkg)dx=A0(f,g)+(b¯.∇f,g).
	

It is natural to ask whether an analogue of the maximum principle (1.2) holds for the discrete problem (1.5), or equivalently

	
∥uh∥QT=max⁡(∥gh∥∂⁡Ω×[0,T],∥vh∥Ω).
	

We shall demonstrate below that, in general, this is not the case. In [2] it was shown, for special families of triangulations Υh with all angles acute, that the backward Euler method may satisfy a maximum principle. His result requires a certain lower bound for the time step and therefore does not imply the same for the semidiscrete method by letting the time step tend to 0 .

As a preparation for our analysis, we express the semidiscrete problem (1.5) in matrix form: Let {Pi}i=1n denote the nodes of Υh in the interior of Ω, and {Pn+i}i=1m those on ∂⁡Ω, and let {Φi}i=1n+m⊂Sh be the standard basis of pyramid functions defined by Φi⁢(Pj)=δi⁢j. The mass and stiffness matrices are then

We now also introduce the vector α⁢(t)=(α1⁢(t),…,αn⁢(t))T of nodal values of uh⁢(t) and correspondingly g~⁢(t)=(g~n+1⁢(t),…,g~n+m⁢(t))T, where g~j⁢(t)=gh⁢(Pj,t) and v~=(vh⁢(P1),…,vh⁢(Pn))T. Thus uh⁢(t)=∑i=1nαi⁢(t)⁢Φi+∑j=1mg~n+j⁢(t)⁢Φn+j, and we may hence write (1.5) as (1.7) ℳ⁢d⁢αd⁢t+𝒮⁢α=-ℬ⁢g~-𝒵⁢d⁢g~d⁢t, for t⩾0  with α⁢(0)=v~. Since the last term in (1.7) cannot be bounded by ∥gh∥∂⁡Ω×[0,T], it is already now clear that the full discrete maximum principle (1.6) cannot hold. We now introduce the discrete semigroup Eh⁢(t) on Sh0 by setting Eh⁢(t)⁢vh= uh⁢(t), where uh⁢(t) is the solution of (1.5) with boundary data gh⁢(t)=0. It has been shown by specific counterexamples in [6] that Eh⁢(t) does not generally satisfy the analogue of (1.4), (1.8) ∥Eh⁢(t)⁢vh∥⩽∥vh∥, for t⩾0. Our first goal in this paper is to show that, in fact, (1.8) cannot hold for any triangulation Υh which is ”fine” enough. We continue to show that Eh⁢(t) cannot be positive in the sense that Eh⁢(t)⁢vh⩾0 if vh⩾0. Thus in neither case (1.6) can be valid. These results will be shown in Section 2 below. For weaker maximum-norm stability estimates than (1.8), see [6]. We now turn to the lumped mass method, which results from replacing the mass matrix ℳ in (1.7) by a diagonal matrix 𝒟 with diagonal elements di⁢i=∑i=1nmi⁢j and also setting 𝒵=0, or (1.9) 𝒟⁢d⁢αd⁢t+𝒮⁢α=-ℬ⁢g~, for t⩾0, with α⁢(0)=v~. This may also be written in variational form, replacing the inner product in (1.5) by a quadrature approximation, or

	
(uh,t,χ)h+A⁢(uh,χ)=0,∀χ∈Sh0,t>0,
	

with uh⁢(t)=gh⁢(t)  on ∂⁡Ω, for t⩾0, and uh⁢(0)=vh, where (Ψ,χ)h=∑τ∈ΥhQτ,h⁢(Ψ⁢χ),Qτ,h⁢(f)=meas⁡(τ)d+1⁢∑Pj∈τ~f⁢(Pj)≈∫τf⁢𝑑x. In this lumped mass case, to be discussed in Section 2 below, we shall show that the discrete maximum principle (1.6) holds if and only if the off-diagonal elements of the stiffness matrix 𝒮 are nonpositive and if ℬ⩽0, elementwise.

64 M. ALMAHAMEED In one space dimension, this is always the case. In two space dimensions, with A= -Δ, this is equivalent to the condition that each edge of Υh, not entirely on ∂⁡Ω, is of Delauney type, in the sense that the sums of the opposing angles in the two triangles containing it are at most π. In fact, if Pi and Pj are neighbors, i.e., if Pi⁢Pj is an edge of Υh, and if α and β are the angles opposite Pi⁢Pj, then (∇⁡Φi,∇⁡Φj)= -sin(α+β)/(4sinαsinβ)<0,=0, or >0 when α+β<π,=π,or >π, respectively, see [1], [5], [6], and [7]. In [2] the condition used was that each of these angles is ⩽π/2, and, for higher space dimensions, similar conditions of ”acute” type are used. In [7] sharp conditions of Delauney type were given for 𝒮-1 to be nonpositive in any number of space dimensions. The stationary discrete elliptic problem corresponding to (1.5) and (1.10) is

	
A⁢(wh,χ)=0,∀χ∈Sh0, with ⁢wh=gh  on ⁢∂⁡Ω
	

If A⁢(χ,χ) is positive definite on Sh0,(1.11) has a unique solution and may be written in matrix form, with α and g~ the vectors of nodal values of wh and gh,

The maximum principle for (1.11), or

	
∥wh∥Ω⩽∥gh∥∂⁡Ω,
	

is now equivalent to the positivity condition α⩾0 for g~⩾0, and hence, by (1.12), 𝒮-1⁢ℬ⩽0 is necessary and sufficient for (1.13). Consider now the discrete parabolic problem (1.10) with vh=0 at interior nodes and gh⁢(t)=gh= constant in time, and assume that A⁢(χ,χ) is positive definite on Sh0 and the maximum principle holds for (1.10). The solution of (1.10) then converges to the solution of (1.11) as t→∞, and (1.13) thus also holds for the discrete stationary problem. Hence 𝒮-1⁢ℬ⩽0 is a necessary condition for (1.6) in this case. In two dimensions and with A=-Δ, by the results already mentioned, under Delauney conditions on Υh, we have 𝒮-1⩾0 and ℬ⩽0 and hence (1.13) holds.

In ℝ3,[3] showed an elliptic maximum principle for tetrahedral decompositions of nonacute type. (For certain convection dominated elliptic cases, [7] ).

"Theorem 3.2. The semigroup E¯h⁢(t) on Sh0 is a contraction if and only if 𝒮 is diagonally dominant.

Proof. If E¯h⁢(t) is a contraction, so is the matrix ℰ¯⁢(t) in (3.1) with respect to the vector maximum-norm |⋅|∞. Since ℰ¯⁢(t)=I-ℋ⁢t+O⁢(t2) as t→0, we have |ℰ¯⁢(t)|∞=max⁡(1-t⁢hi⁢i+t⁢∑j≠i|hi⁢j|)+O⁢(t2). For this norm to be bounded by 1 , we find at once by taking t small that it is necessary that ∑j≠i|hi⁢j|≤hi⁢i for i=1:n, so that ℋ is diagonally dominant. Since 𝒟 is a positive diagonal matrix, 𝒮=𝒟⁢ℋ is then also diagonally dominant.

Conversely, if we know that 𝒮, and hence also ℋ=𝒟-1⁢𝒮, is diagonally dominant, it is easy to see that

from which |w|∞≤|v|∞, which shows (3.5). By (3.3) this implies |ℰ¯⁢(t)|∞≤1, for t≥0, so that E¯h⁢(t) is a contraction. We now express the corresponding result for the positivity of E¯h⁢(t). Theorem 3.3. The semigroup E¯h⁢(t) is positive if and only if si⁢j≤0 for j≠i. Proof. This time the positivity of ℰ¯⁢(t), together with (3.2), shows at once that the off-diagonal elements ℋ are nonpositive. Since 𝒮=𝒟⁢ℋ, this shows the only if part of the theorem.

Conversely, if the off-diagonal elements of ℋ are nonpositive, one finds as in the last part of the proof of Theorem 3.1 that ℰ¯⁢(t)≥0.","Theorem 2.4. The semigroup E~h⁢(t) on Sh0 is a contraction if and only if 𝒮 is diagonally dominant. Proof. If E~h⁢(t) is a contraction, so is the matrix ε~⁢(t) in (2.4) with respect to the vector maximum-norm |⋅|∞. Since ε~⁢(t)=I-ℋ⁢t+O⁢(t2) as t→0, we have

	
|ε~⁢(t)|∞=max⁡(1-t⁢hi⁢i+t⁢∑j≠i∞|hi⁢j|)+O⁢(t2).
	

For this norm to be bounded by 1 , we find at once by taking t small that it is necessary that ∑j≠i|hi⁢j|⩽hi⁢i for i=1:n, so that ℋ is diagonally dominant. Since 𝒟 is a positive diagonal matrix, 𝒮=𝒟⁢ℋ is then also diagonally dominant.

Conversely, if we know that 𝒮, and hence also ℋ=𝒟-1⁢𝒮, is diagonally dominant,it is easy to see that (2.8) |(I+k⁢ℋ)-1|∞⩽1, for k>0. In fact, set w=(I+k⁢ℋ)-1⁢v and let |wj|=|w|∞. Then (1+k⁢hj⁢j)⁢|wj|=|vj-k⁢∑l≠jhj⁢l⁢wl|⩽|v|∞+k⁢hj⁢j⁢|w|∞, from which |w|∞⩽|v|∞, which shows (2.8). By (2.6) this implies |ε~⁢(t)|∞⩽1, for t⩾0, so that E~h⁢(t) is a contraction. Theorem 2.5. The semigroup E~h⁢(t) is positive if and only if si⁢j⩽0 for j≠i. Proof. In this case the positivity of ε~⁢(t), together with (2.5), shows at once that the off-diagonal elements of ℋ are nonpositive.

"In this section we shall show that, in general, a maximum principle cannot hold for the semidiscrete standard Galerkin method (1.5). We shall show that, in fact, the discrete solution operator Eh⁢(t) on Sh0, thus with gh⁢(t)=0, is, in general, neither contractive nor positive. For our analysis, we define a node Pi of 𝒯h to be strictly interior if all its neighbors are interior, and a near-boundary node if it is interior but not strictly interior. We set σi=supp⁡(Φi).

Theorem 2.1. Assume that div⁡b¯=0 and that 𝒯h is such that each near-boundary node has a strictly interior neighbor. Then Eh⁢(t) cannot be a contraction.

The condition div⁡b¯=0 is superfluous if for each near-boundary node Pj and an associated strictly interior neighbor Pi, we have meas (σj∩σi)≥c meas (σi) with c>0 and if h is sufficiently small. Proof. Setting t=0 in (1.7), with g~=0 and α⁢(0)=1¯=(1,1,…,1)T, we have (2.1) ℳ⁢β=-γ=-𝒮⁢1¯, where β=α′⁢(0). If Eh⁢(t) were a contraction, then we would have β≤0 elementwise, and hence γ≥0, and we shall show that this is not possible under the assumptions of the theorem. Let wh=∑j=1nΦj∈Sh correspond to the vector 1¯ above.

We assume first that div⁡b¯=0. In this case we have for the element γi of γ, corresponding to a strictly interior node Pi, using integration by parts,

	
γi=∑j=1nsi⁢j=A⁢(Φi,wh)=(b¯⋅∇⁡Φi,wh)=-(div⁡b¯⁢Φi,wh)=0,
	

since wh=1 on σi. Hence ∑j=1nmi⁢j⁢βj=0 for β as in (2.1). Here mi⁢j≥0, with mi⁢j>0 if and only if j=i or if Pj is a neighbor of Pi, and if β≤0, then βj=0 License or copyright restrictions may apply to redistribution; see https://www.ams.org/journal-terms-of-use

MAXIMUM PRINCIPLES IN PARABOLIC FINITE ELEMENT EQUATIONS 15 for the corresponding j. Thus by the assumption on 𝒯h we have β=0 and hence γ=0. But γ cannot be zero since (2.3) γ⋅1¯=𝒮⁢1¯⋅1¯=A⁢(wh,wh)=A0⁢(wh,wh)-12⁢(div⁡b¯⁢wh,wh)>0. We now turn to the case of a general b¯ and assume again that β≤0. For Pi a strictly interior node we now have, by (2.1) and (2.2), that mi⁢i⁢|βi|≤γi≤ C meas (σi). Since mi⁢i≥c meas (σi), with c>0, it follows that |βi|≤C for a positive constant C. If Pj is a near-boundary node, let Pi be a strictly interior neighboring node. Then mi⁢j⁢|βj|≤∑l=1nmi⁢l⁢|βl|=γi≤C meas (σi), and, since, by assumption, mi⁢j=(Φi,Φj)≥c meas (σi∩σj)≥c meas (σi), we conclude also now that |βj|≤C. Thus, for all interior nodes Pi,γi≤C⁢∑j=1nmi⁢j≤C⁢meas⁡(σi), and hence γ⋅1¯≤C. But, by the first part of (2.3),

	
γ⋅1¯=𝒮⁢1¯⋅1¯≥c⁢∥∇⁡wh∥L22-C.
	

Here ∇⁡wh=0 on all interior simplices τ∈𝒯h, so that only boundary simplices contribute to the first term on the right. For a boundary simplex τ, which has a full (d-1)-dimensional face Fτ on ∂⁡Ω, we have, with dτ the distance from the interior vertex of τ to the hyperplane containing Fτ, and with |Fτ| the (d-1)-dimensional measure of Fτ,

	
∥∇⁡wh∥L2⁢(τ)2≥dτ-2⁢meas⁡(τ)≥c⁢dτ-1⁢|Fτ|≥c⁢h-1⁢|Fτ|, with ⁢c>0
	

Hence after summation over these τ, since ⋃τFτ=∂⁡Ω, we conclude that γ⋅1¯≥ c⁢h-1-C. For small h this contradicts the boundedness of γ⋅1¯.

We note that, in one space dimension, the first assumption about 𝒯h holds if there are at least three interior nodes, and when d=2, the second assumption is satisfied when the triangulation is fine enough, and the angles in the triangles of ⋃iσi are bounded below where the union is taken over all i such that Pi is a strictly interior neighbor of a near-boundary node. To see that some condition on 𝒯h is needed, we consider the case when there is only one interior node P1 and div b¯=0. The system (1.7) then reduces to the scalar equation

	
∥Φ1∥L22⁢α1′+A0⁢(Φ1,Φ1)⁢α1=0, for ⁢t≥0,α1⁢(0)=v~=(vh,Φ1).
	

The solution is then the exponentially decreasing function uh⁢(t)=exp⁡(-t⁢λ)⁢v~, with λ=A0⁢(Φ1,Φ1)/∥Φ1∥L22>0, and the solution operator is a contraction.

Theorem 2.2. Assume that div⁡b¯≤0 and that 𝒯h is such that there exists a strictly interior node, P1 say, such that any neighbor of P1 has an interior neighbor which is not a neighbor of P1. Then Eh⁢(t) cannot be a positive operator. The condition div b¯≤0 is not needed if h is sufficiently small. Proof. If Eh⁢(t) is a positive operator, then, by (1.7) with g~=0, we have that ℰ⁢(t)= e-𝒦⁢t≥0, elementwise, where 𝒦=(ki⁢j)=ℳ-1⁢𝒮. Since ℰ⁢(t)=I-𝒦⁢t+O⁢(t2) as t→0, we see that then all off-diagonal elements of 𝒦 are nonpositive. We shall show that this is impossible.

Let Pi be any interior node ≠P1 which is not a neighbor of P1. Since ℳ⁢𝒦=𝒮 and since mi⁢1=si⁢1=0, we have ∑j≠1mi⁢j⁢kj⁢1=0. Hence kj⁢1=0 when mi⁢j>0, i.e., when j=i and when j is such that Pj is a neighbor of Pi. By our assumption about 𝒯h this shows that actually kj⁢1=0 for all j≠1; this is also true when Pj and P1 are neighbors. Thus the first column of 𝒦 only contains one possible nonzero element, namely k11. License or copyright restrictions may apply to redistribution; see https://www.ams.org/journal-terms-of-use

MAXIMUM PRINCIPLES FOR PROBLEMS OF GENERAL PARABOLIC PARTIAL … 65 semidiscrete standard Galerkin method (1.5). We shall show that, in fact, the discrete solution operator Eh⁢(t) on Sh0, with gh⁢(t)=0, is, in general, neither contractive nor positive. For our analysis, we define a node Pi of Υh to be strictly interior if all its neighbors are interior, and a near-boundary node if it is interior but not strictly interior. We set σi=supp⁡(Φi). Theorem 2.1. Assume that div b¯=0 and that Υh is such that each near-boundary node has a strictly interior neighbor. Then Eh⁢(t) cannot be a contraction.

The condition div b¯=0 is superfluous if for each near-boundary node Pj and an associated strictly interior neighbor Pi, we have meas (σj∩σi)⩾c meas (σi) with c>0 and if h is sufficiently small. Proof. Setting t=0 in (1.7), with g~=0 and α⁢(0)=1¯=(1,1,…,1)T, we have (2.1) ℳ⁢β=-γ=-𝒮⁢1¯, where β=α′⁢(0). If Eh⁢(t) were a contraction, then we would have β⩽0 elementwise, and hence γ⩾0. and we shall show that this is not possible under the assumptions of the theorem. Let wh=∑j=1nΦj∈Sh correspond to the vector 1¯ above. We assume first that div⁡b¯=0. In this case we have for the element γi of γ, corresponding to a strictly interior node Pi, using integration by parts, (2.2) γi=∑j=1nsi⁢j=A⁢(Φi,wh)=(b¯⋅∇⁡Φi,wh)=-(div⁡b¯⁢Φi,wh)=0, since wh=1 on σi. Hence ∑j=1nmi⁢j⁢βj=0 for β as in (2.1) . Here mi⁢j>0 if and only if j=i or if Pj is a neighbor of Pi, and if β⩽0, then βj= 0 for the corresponding j. Thus by the assumption on Υh we have β=0 and hence γ=0. But γ cannot be zero since (2.3) γ⋅1¯=𝒮⁢1¯⋅1¯=A⁢(wh,wh)=A0⁢(wh,wh)-12⁢(div⁡b¯⁢wh,wh)>0. We now turn to the case of a general b¯ and assume again that β⩽0. For Pi a strictly interior node we now have, by (2.1) and (2.2), that mi⁢i⁢|βi|⩽γi⩽C meas (σi). Since mi⁢i⩽c meas (σi), with c>0, it follows that |βi|⩽C for a positive constant C. If Pj is a near-boundary node, let Pi be a strictly interior neighboring node. Then mi⁢j⁢|βj|⩽∑i=1nmi⁢l⁢|βl|=γi⩽C meas (σi) and since, by assumption, mi⁢j=(Φi,Φj)⩾c meas (σj∩σi)⩾c meas (σi), we conclude also now that |βi|⩽C. Thus, for all interior nodes Pi,

	
γi⩽C⁢∑j=1nmi⁢j⩽Cmeas⁡(σi), and hence ⁢γ⋅1¯⩽C⁢. 
	




66 M. ALMAHAMEED But, by the first part of (2.3),

	
γ⋅1¯=𝒮⁢1¯⋅1¯⩾c⁢∥∇⁡wh∥L22-C.
	

Here ∇⁡wh=0 on all interior simplices τ∈Υh, so that only boundary simplices contribute to the first term on the right. For a boundary simplex τ, which has a full (d-1)-dimensional face Fτ on ∂⁡Ω, we have, with dτ the distance from the interior vertex of τ to the hyperplane containing Fτ, and with |Fτ| the (d-1) dimensional measure of Fτ,

	
∥∇⁡wh∥L2⁢(τ)2⩾dτ-2⁢meas⁡(τ)⩾c⁢dτ-1⁢|Fτ|⩾c⁢h-1⁢|Fτ|, with ⁢c>0.
	

Hence after summation over these τ, since ∪τFτ=∂⁡Ω, we conclude that γ⋅1¯⩾c⁢h-1-C. For small h this contradicts the boundedness of γ⋅1¯. We note that, in one space dimension, the first assumption about Υh holds if there are at least three interior nodes, and when d=2 the second assumption is satisfied when the triangulation is fine enough, and the angles in the triangles of ∪iσi are bounded below where the union is taken over all i such that Pi is a strictly interior neighbor of a near-boundary node. To see that some condition on Υh is needed, we consider the case when there is only one interior node P1 and div⁡b¯=0. The system (1.7) then reduces to the scalar equation

	
∥Φ1∥L22⁢α1′+A0⁢(Φ1,Φ1)⁢α1=0, for ⁢t⩾0,α1⁢(0)=v~=(vh,Φ1).
	

The solution is then the exponentially decreasing function uh⁢(t)=exp⁡(-t⁢λ)⁢v~, with λ=A0⁢(Φ1,Φ1)/∥Φ1∥L22>0, and the solution operator is a contraction.

Theorem 2.2. Assume that div b¯⩽0 and that Υh is such that there exists a strictly interior node, P1 say, such that any neighbor of P1 has an interior neighbor which is not a neighbor of P1. Then Eh⁢(t) cannot be a positive operator. The condition div b¯⩽0 is not needed if h is sufficiently small. Proof. If Eh⁢(t) is a positive operator, then, by (1.7) with g~=0, we have that ε⁢(t)=e-𝒦⁢t⩾0, elementwise, where 𝒦=(ki⁢j)=ℳ-1⁢𝒮. Since ε⁢(t)=I-𝒦⁢t+O⁢(t2) as t→0, we see that then all off-diagonal elements of 𝒦 are nonpositive. We shall show that this is impossible.

Let Pi be any interior node ≠P1 which is not a neighbor of P1. Since ℳ⁢𝒦=𝒮 and since mi⁢1=si⁢1=0, we have ∑j≠1nmi⁢j⁢kj⁢1=0. Hence kj⁢1=0 when mi⁢j> 0, i.e., when j=i and when j is such that Pj is a neighbor of Pi. By our assumption about Υh this shows that actually kj⁢1=0 for all j≠1; this is also true when Pj and P1 are neighbors. Thus the first column of 𝒦 only contains one possible nonzero element, namely k11. For the stiffness matrix 𝒮 we have

	
∑j=1nsj⁢1=A⁢(1,Φ1)=0⁢ while, if div ⁢b¯⩽0,

([1]) Let E be a real smooth Banach space, A:E→2E* be a maximal monotone mapping, then A-1⁢0 is a closed and convex subset of E and the graph of A,G⁢(A), is demiclosed in the following sense: ∀xn∈D⁢(A) with xn→x in E, and ∀yn∈A⁢xn with yn→y in E imply that x∈D⁢(A) and y∈A⁢x.

Lemma 1.2. ([7]) Let C be a nonempty closed and convex subset of a real reflexive, strictly convex, and smooth Banach space E and let x∈E. Then y∈C V2⁢(y,ΠC⁢x)+V2⁢(ΠC⁢x,x)≤V2⁢(y,x) Lemma 1.3. ([7]) Let C be a convex subset of a real smooth Banach space E. Let x∈E and x0∈C. Then V2⁢(x0,x)=inf⁡{V2⁢(z,x):z∈C} if and only if

	
⟨z-x0,J⁢x0-J⁢x⟩≥0.
	

Lemma 1.4. ([4]) Let E be a real smooth and uniformly convex Banach space and let {xn} and {yn} be two sequences of E. If either {xn} or {yn} is bounded and V2⁢(xn,yn)→0 as n→∞, then xn-yn→0, as n→∞.

Let E* be a smooth Banach space and let D* be a nonempty closed convex subset of E*. A mapping R*:D*→D* is called generalized nonexpansive if F⁢(R*)≠∅ and

	
V⁢(R*⁢x*,J-1⁢y*)≤V⁢(x*,J-1⁢y*),∀x*∈D*,y*∈F⁢(R*),
	

where F⁢(R*) is the set of fixed points of R*. Let C be a nonempty closed convex subset of E, and let T be a mapping from C into itself. We denote by F⁢(T) the set of fixed points of T. A point of p in C is said to be a strong asymptotic fixed point of T if C contains a sequence {xn} which converges strongly to p such that the strong limn→∞⁡(T⁢xn-xn)=0. The set of strong asymptotic fixed points of T will be denoted by F~⁢(T). A mapping T from C into itself is called weak relatively nonexpansive if F~⁢(T)=F⁢(T) and V2⁢(p,T⁢x)≤V2⁢(p,x) for all x∈C and p∈F⁢(T).(see[8])",1437.47042.tex,1325.47132.tex,Text-to-Math; Deletions; Paraphrase
"Let E* be a reflexive and smooth Banach space and let B⁢C E×E* be a maximal monotone operator. For each λ>0 and x∈E, consider the set:

	
Jλ*⁢x*:={z*∈E*:x*∈z*+λ⁢B⁢J-1⁢(z*)}.
	

If z1*+λ⁢w1*=x*,z2*+λ⁢w2*=x*,w1*∈B⁢J-1⁢(z1*), w2*∈B⁢J-1⁢(z2*), then we have from the monotonicity of B that

	
⟨w1*-w2*,J-1⁢(z1*)-J-1⁢(z2*)⟩≥0,
	

and hence

	
⟨x*-z1*λ-x*-z2*λ,J-1⁢(z1*)-J-1⁢(z2*)⟩≥0.
	

So, we obtain

	
⟨x*-z1*-(x*-z2*),J-1⁢(z1*)-J-1⁢(z2*)⟩≥0,
	

and hence

	
⟨z2*-z1*,J-1⁢(z1*)-J-1⁢(z2*)⟩≥0.
	

This implies z1*=z2*. Then, Jλ*⁢x* consists of one point. We also denote the domain and the range of Jλ*⁢x* by D⁢(Jλ*)= R⁢(I*+λ⁢B⁢J-1) and R⁢(Jλ*)=D⁢(B⁢J-1), respectively, where I* is the identity on E*. Such a Jλ*:E*→E* is called the generalized resolvent of B and is denoted by

	
Jλ*=(I*+λ⁢B⁢J-1)-1⁢. 
	

We get some properties of Jλ* and (B⁢J-1)-1⁢0.

Proposition 5. Let E* be a reflexive and strictly convex Banach space with a Fréchet differentiable norm and let B⁢C E×E* be a maximal monotone operator with B-1⁢0≠∅. Then, the following hold:

(1) D⁢(Jλ*)=E* for each λ>0;

(2) (B⁢J-1)-1⁢0=F⁢(Jλ*) for each λ>0, where F⁢(Jλ*) is the set of fixed points of Jλ*;

(3) (B⁢J-1)-1⁢0 is closed;

(4) Jλ*:E*→E* is generalized nonexpansive for each λ>0.

Proof. (1) From the maximality of B, we have

	
R⁢(J+λ⁢B)=E*,∀λ>0.
	

Hence, for each x*∈E*, there exists x∈E such that x*∈J⁢x+λ⁢B⁢x. Since E is reflexive and strictly convex, J is bijective. Therefore, there exists z*∈E* such that x= J-1⁢(z*). Therefore, we have

	x*	∈J⁢J-1⁢(z*)+λ⁢B⁢J-1⁢(z*)	
		=z*+λ⁢B⁢J-1⁢(z*)⊂R⁢(I*+λ⁢B⁢J-1)=D⁢(Jλ*).	

This implies E*⊂D⁢(Jλ*).D⁢(Jλ*)⊂E* is clear. So, we have D⁢(Jλ*)=E*.

(2) Let λ>0. Then, we have

	x*∈F⁢(Jλ)	⟺Jλ*x*=x*⟺x*∈x*+λBJ-1(x*)	
		⟺0∈λBJ-1(x*)⟺0∈BJ-1(x*)	
		⟺x*∈(B⁢J-1)-1⁢0.	

(3) Let {xn*}⊂(B⁢J-1)-1⁢0 with xn*→x*. From xn*∈ (B⁢J-1)-1⁢0, we have J-1⁢(xn*)∈B-1⁢0. Since J-1 is norm to norm continuous and B-1⁢0 is closed, we have that J-1⁢(xn*)→ J-1⁢(x*)∈B-1⁢0. This implies x*∈(B⁢J-1)-1⁢0. That is, (B⁢J-1)-1⁢0 is closed.

(4) Let x*∈E*,y*∈E*,z*∈E*, and λ>0. By Definition (2) and calculating that

	V(x*,	J-1z*)+V(z*,J-1y*)	
	=	∥x*∥2+∥z*∥2-2⁢⟨x*,J-1⁢z*⟩	
		+∥y*∥2+∥z*∥2-2⁢⟨z*,J-1⁢y*⟩	
	=	V⁢(x*,J-1⁢y*)+2⁢⟨z*-x*,J-1⁢z*-J-1⁢y*⟩,	

we have that

	V⁢(x*,J-1⁢y*)=	V⁢(x*,J-1⁢z*)+V⁢(z*,J-1⁢y*)	
		+2⁢⟨x*-z*,J-1⁢z*-J-1⁢y*⟩.	

Let x*∈E*,y*∈F⁢(Jλ), and λ>0. From the above formula, we have

	V⁢(x*,J-1⁢y*)=	V⁢(x*,J-1⁢Jλ*⁢x*)+V⁢(Jλ*⁢x*,J-1⁢y*)	
		+2⁢⟨x*-Jλ*⁢x*,J-1⁢Jλ⁢x*-J-1⁢y*⟩.	

Since ((x*-Jλ*⁢x*)/λ)∈B⁢J-1⁢(Jλ*⁢x*) and 0∈B⁢J-1⁢(y*), we have

	
⟨x*-Jλ*⁢x*,J-1⁢Jλ*⁢x*-J-1⁢y*⟩≥0.
	

Therefore, we get

V⁢(x*,J-1⁢y*)≥V⁢(x*,J-1⁢Jλ*⁢x*)+V⁢(Jλ*⁢x*,J-1⁢y*)

	
≥V⁢(Jλ*⁢x*,J-1⁢y*).
	

That is, Jλ* is generalized nonexpansive on E*.

Theorem 6 (see [8]). Let E be a Banach space and let A⊂ E×E* be a maximal monotone operator with A-1⁢0≠∅. If E* is strictly convex and has a Fréchet differentiable norm, then, for each x∈E,limλ→∞⁡(J+λ⁢A)-1⁢J⁢(x) exists and belongs to A-1⁢0.

Using Theorem 6, we get the following result.

Theorem 7. Let E* be a uniformly convex Banach space with a Fréchet differentiable norm and let B⊂E×E* be a maximal monotone operator with B-1⁢0≠∅. Then the following hold:

(1) for each x*∈E*,limλ→∞⁡Jλ*⁢x* exists and belongs to (B⁢J-1)-1⁢0;

(2) if R*⁢x*:=limλ→∞⁡Jλ*⁢x* for each x*∈E*, then R* is a sunny generalized nonexpansive retraction of E* onto (B⁢J-1)-1⁢0.

Proof. (1) By defining a mapping Qλ from E to E by

	
Qλ⁢x:=(I+λ⁢J-1⁢B)⁢x,∀x∈E,λ>0,
	

we have, for all x*∈E*,λ>0,Jλ*⁢x*=J⁢Qλ⁢J-1⁢(x*). In fact, define

	
xλ*:=J⁢Qλ⁢J-1⁢(x*)=[J⁢(I+λ⁢J-1⁢B)⁢J-1]-1⁢(x*).
	

Then, we have

	
x*∈J⁢(I+λ⁢J-1⁢B)⁢J-1⁢(xλ*)=(I*+λ⁢B⁢J-1)⁢xλ*,
	

and hence xλ*=Jλ*⁢x*. From Theorem 6 , we get

	
limλ→∞⁡Qλ⁢J-1⁢(x*)=u∈B-1⁢0.
	

If E* is uniformly convex, then E has a Fréchet differentiable norm. So, J is norm to norm continuous. Since B-1⁢0 is closed, we have

	
limλ→∞⁡Jλ*⁢x*=limλ→∞⁡J⁢Qλ⁢J-1⁢(x*)=J⁢u∈J⁢B-1⁢0=(B⁢J-1)-1⁢0.
	

(2) We define a mapping R* from E* to E* by

	
R*⁢x*:=limλ→∞⁡Jλ*⁢x*,∀x*∈E*.
	

Let u*∈(B⁢J-1)-1⁢0=F⁢(Jλ*⁢x*). Then, R*⁢u*=limλ→∞⁡Jλ*⁢u*= limλ→∞⁡u*=u*. Therefore, R* is a retraction of E* onto (B⁢J-1)-1⁢0. Since x*∈Jλ*⁢x*+λ⁢B⁢J-1⁢(Jλ*⁢x*), we have

	
⟨x*-Jλ*⁢x*λ,J-1⁢(Jλ*⁢x*)-J-1⁢(z*)⟩≥0,
∀z*∈(B⁢J-1)-1⁢0,
	

and hence

	
⟨x*-Jλ*⁢x*,J-1⁢(Jλ*⁢x*)-J-1⁢(z*)⟩≥0.
	

Letting λ→0, we get

	
⟨x*-R*⁢x*,J-1⁢(R*⁢x*)-J-1⁢(z*)⟩≥0,∀z*∈(B⁢J-1)-1⁢0.
	

From Proposition 5, R* is sunny and generalized nonexpansive. This implies that R* is a sunny generalized nonexpansive retraction of E* onto (B⁢J-1)-1⁢0.","Let E* be a reflexive and smooth Banach space and let B⊂E×E* be a maximal monotone operator. For each λ>0 and x∈E, consider the set

	
Jλ*⁢x*:={z*∈E*:x*∈z*+λ⁢B⁢J-1⁢(z*)}.
	

If z1*+λ⁢w1*=x*,z2*+λ⁢w2*=x*,w1*∈B⁢J-1⁢(z1*),w2*∈B⁢J-1⁢(z2*), then we have from the monotonicity of B that

	
⟨w1*-w2*,J-1⁢(z1*)-J-1⁢(z2*)⟩≥0
	

and hence

	
⟨x*-z1*λ-x*-z2*λ,J-1⁢(z1*)-J-1⁢(z2*)⟩≥0
	

So, we obtain

	
⟨x*-z1*-(x*-z2*),J-1⁢(z1*)-J-1⁢(z2*)⟩≥0.
	

and hence

	
⟨z2*-z1*,J-1⁢(z1*)-J-1⁢(z2*)⟩≥0
	

This implies z1*=z2*. Then Jλ*⁢x* consists of one point. We also denote the domain and the range of Jλ*⁢x* by D⁢(Jλ*)=R⁢(I*+λ⁢B⁢J-1) and R⁢(Jλ*)= D⁢(B⁢J-1), respectively, where I* is the identity on E*. Such a Jλ*:E*→E* is called the generalized resolvent of B and is denoted by

	
Jλ*=(I*+λ⁢B⁢J-1)-1⁢. 
	

We get some properties of Jλ* and (B⁢J-1)-1⁢0. Proposition 2.1. Let E* be a reflexive and strictly convex Banach space with a Fréchet differentiable norm and let B⊂E×E* be a maximal monotone operator with B-1⁢0≠∅. Then the following hold: (1) D⁢(Jλ*)=E* for each λ>0. (2) (B⁢J-1)-1⁢0=F⁢(Jλ*) for each λ>0, where F⁢(Jλ*) is the set of fixed points of Jλ*. (3) (B⁢J-1)-1⁢0 is closed. (4) Jλ*:E*→E* is generalized nonexpansive for each λ>0. Proof. (1) From the maximality of B, we have

	
R⁢(J+λ⁢B)=E*,∀λ>0.
	

Hence, for each x*∈E*, there exists x∈E. such that x*∈J⁢x+λ⁢B⁢x. Since E is reflexive and strictly convex, then J is bijective. Therefore, there exists z*∈E* such that x=J-1⁢(z*). Therefore, we have

	
x*∈J⁢J-1⁢(z*)+λ⁢B⁢J-1⁢(z*)=z*+λ⁢B⁢J-1⁢(z*)⊂R⁢(I*+λ⁢B⁢J-1)=D⁢(Jλ*).
	

This implies E*⊂D⁢(Jλ*).D⁢(Jλ*)⊂E* is clear. So, we have D⁢(Jλ*)=E*.

75 X.WANG, J.M.CHEN, AND Z.HE (2) Let λ>0. Then we have

	
x*∈F⁢(Jλ)⇔Jλ*⁢x*=x*⇔x*∈x*+λ⁢B⁢J-1⁢(x*)
⇔0∈λBJ-1(x*)⇔0∈BJ-1(x*)⇔x*∈(BJ-1)-10.
	

(3) Let {xn*}⊂(B⁢J-1)-1⁢0 with xn*→x*. From xn*∈(B⁢J-1)-1⁢0, we have J-1⁢(xn*)∈B-1⁢0. Since J-1 is norm to norm continuous, and B-1⁢0 is closed, we have that J-1⁢(xn*)→J-1⁢(x*)∈B-1⁢0. This implies x*∈(B⁢J-1)-1⁢0. That is, (B⁢J-1)-1⁢0 is closed. (4) Let x*∈E*,y*∈E*,z*∈E* and λ>0. By definition (1.1) and calculated that

	V⁢(x*,J-1⁢z*)+V⁢(z*,J-1⁢y*)=∥x*∥2+∥z*∥2-2⁢⟨x*,J-1⁢z*⟩	
		+∥y*∥2+∥z*∥2-2⁢⟨z*,J-1⁢y*⟩	
		=V⁢(x*,J-1⁢y*)+2⁢⟨z*-x*,J-1⁢z*-J-1⁢y*⟩	

we have that

	
V⁢(x*,J-1⁢y*)=V⁢(x*,J-1⁢z*)+V⁢(z*,J-1⁢y*)+2⁢⟨x*-z*,J-1⁢z*-J-1⁢y*⟩.
	

Let x*∈E*,y*∈F⁢(Jλ) and λ>0. From above formula , we have

	
V⁢(x*,J-1⁢y*)=V⁢(x*,J-1⁢Jλ*⁢x*)+V⁢(Jλ*⁢x*,J-1⁢y*)+2⁢⟨x*-Jλ*⁢x*,J-1⁢Jλ⁢x*-J-1⁢y*⟩.
	

Since x*-Jλ*⁢x*λ∈B⁢J-1⁢(Jλ*⁢x*) and 0∈B⁢J-1⁢(y*), we have

	
⟨x*-Jλ*⁢x*,J-1⁢Jλ*⁢x*-J-1⁢y*⟩≥0.
	

Therefore we get

	
V⁢(x*,J-1⁢y*)≥V⁢(x*,J-1⁢Jλ*⁢x*)+V⁢(Jλ*⁢x*,J-1⁢y*)≥V⁢(Jλ*⁢x*,J-1⁢y*).
	

That is, Jλ* is generalized nonexpansive on E*. Theorem 2.2. ([5]) Let E be a Banach space and let A⊂E×E* be a maximal monotone operator with A-1⁢0≠∅. If E* is strictly convex and has a Fréchet differentiable norm, then, for each x∈E,limλ→∞⁡(J+λ⁢A)-1⁢J⁢(x) exists and belongs to A-1⁢0. Using Theorem 2.2, we get the following result. Theorem 2.3. Let E* be a uniformly convex Banach space with a Fréchet differentiable norm and let B⊂E×E* be a maximal monotone operator with B-1⁢0≠∅. Then the following hold: (1) For each x*∈E*,limλ→∞⁡Jλ*⁢x* exists and belongs to (B⁢J-1)-1⁢0. (2) If R*⁢x*:=limλ→∞⁡Jλ*⁢x* for each x*∈E*, then R* is a sunny generalized nonexpansive retraction of E* onto (B⁢J-1)-1⁢0.

A NEW GENERALIZED RESOLVENT AND APPLICATION 73 Proof. (1) Defining a mapping Qλ from E to E by

	
Qλx:=(I+λJ-1B))-1x,∀x∈E,λ>0,
	

we have, for ∀x*∈E*,λ>0,Jλ*⁢x*=J⁢Qλ⁢J-1⁢(x*). In fact, define

	
xλ*:=J⁢Qλ⁢J-1⁢(x*)=[J⁢(I+λ⁢J-1⁢B)⁢J-1]-1⁢(x*).
	

Then, we have

	
x*∈J⁢(I+λ⁢J-1⁢B)⁢J-1⁢(xλ*)=(I*+λ⁢B⁢J-1)⁢xλ*
	

and hence xλ*=Jλ*⁢x*. From Theorem 2.1, we get

	
limλ→∞⁡Qλ⁢J-1⁢(x*)=u∈B-1⁢0.
	

If E* is uniformly convex, then E has a Fréchet differentiable norm. So, then J is norm to norm continuous. Since B-1⁢0 is closed, we have

	
limλ→∞⁡Jλ*⁢x*=limλ→∞⁡J⁢Qλ⁢J-1⁢(x*)=J⁢u∈J⁢B-1⁢0=(B⁢J-1)-1⁢0.
	

(2) Defining a mapping R* from E* to E* by

	
R*⁢x*:=limλ→∞⁡Jλ*⁢x* ∀x*∈E*.
	

Let u*∈(B⁢J-1)-1⁢0=F⁢(Jλ*⁢x*). Then R*⁢u*=limλ→∞⁡Jλ*⁢u*=limλ→∞⁡u*= u*. Therefore R* is a retraction of E* onto (B⁢J-1)-1⁢0. Since x*∈Jλ*⁢x*+ λ⁢B⁢J-1⁢(Jλ*⁢x*), we have

	
⟨x*-Jλ*⁢x*λ,J-1⁢(Jλ*⁢x*)-J-1⁢(z*)⟩≥0,∀z*∈(B⁢J-1)-1⁢0,
	

and hence

	
⟨x*-Jλ*⁢x*,J-1⁢(Jλ*⁢x*)-J-1⁢(z*)⟩≥0.
	

Letting λ→0, we get

	
⟨x*-R*⁢x*,J-1⁢(R*⁢x*)-J-1⁢(z*)⟩≥0,∀z*∈(B⁢J-1)-1⁢0
	

From Proposition 2.1,R* is sunny and generalized nonexpansive. This implies that R* is a sunny generalized nonexpansive retraction of E* onto (B⁢J-1)-1⁢0.",1437.47042.tex,1325.47132.tex,Different Presentation; Paraphrase
"Now we construct an iterative scheme which converges strongly to a point which is a fixed point of relatively weak nonexpansive mapping and a zero of monotone mapping.

Theorem 8. Let E* be a uniformly convex Banach space and uniformly smooth Banach space. Let A⊂E×E* be a maximal monotone operator. Let C be a nonempty closed convex subset of E. Let T:C→C be a relatively weak nonexpansive mapping with A-1⁢0∩F⁢(T)≠∅. Assume that 0≤αn<a<1 is a sequence of real numbers. Then, the sequence {xn} generated by

	
x0∈C,λn⟶+∞,
yn=J-1⁢(αn⁢J⁢xn+(1-αn)⁢Jλn*⁢J⁢xn),
Jλn*=(I*+λn⁢A⁢J-1)-1,
zn=T⁢yn,
H0={v∈C:V2⁢(v,z0)≤V2⁢(v,y0)≤V2⁢(v,x0)},
Hn={v∈Hn-1∩Wn-1:V2⁢(v,zn)≤V2⁢(v,yn)≤V2⁢(v,xn)},
W0=C,
Wn={v∈Hn-1∩Wn-1:⟨v-xn,J⁢x0-J⁢xn⟩≤0},
xn+1=∏Hn∩Wn(x0),n≥1
	

converges strongly to ΠA-1∩⁣∩F⁢(T)⁢(x0), where ΠA-1⁢0∩F⁢(T) is the generalized projection from E onto A-1⁢0∩F⁢(T).

Proof. We first show that Hn and Wn are closed and convex for each n≥0. From the definition of Hn and Wn, it is obvious that Hn is closed and Wn is closed and convex for each n≥0. We show that Hn is convex. Since

	
Hn={v∈Hn-1∩Wn-1:V2⁢(v,zn)≤V2⁢(v,yn)}
∩{v∈Hn-1∩Wn-1:V2⁢(v,yn)≤V2⁢(v,xn)},
V2⁢(v,yn)≤V2⁢(v,xn)⁢ is equivalent to 
2⁢⟨v,J⁢xn-J⁢yn⟩+∥yn∥2+∥xn∥2≤0,
 and ⁢V2⁢(v,zn)≤V2⁢(v,yn)⁢ is equivalent to 
2⁢⟨v,J⁢yn-J⁢zn⟩+∥zn∥2+∥xn∥2≤0,
	

it follows that Hn is convex.

Next, we show that F=:A-10∩F(T)⊂Hn∩Wn for each n≥0. Let p∈F; then relatively weak nonexpansiveness of T and generalized nonexpansiveness of Jλ* give that

	V2⁢(p,z0)=	V2⁢(p,T⁢y0)≤V2⁢(p,y0)	
	=	V2⁢(p,J-1⁢(α0⁢J⁢x0+(1-α0)⁢Jλ0*⁢J⁢x0))	
	=	∥p∥2+∥α0⁢J⁢x0+(1-α0)⁢Jλ0*⁢J⁢x0∥2	
		-2⁢⟨p,α0⁢J⁢x0+(1-α0)⁢Jλ0*⁢J⁢x0⟩	
	≤	∥p∥2-2⁢α0⁢⟨p,J⁢x0⟩-2⁢(1-α0)⁢⟨p,J⁢Jλ0*⁢J⁢x0⟩	
		+α0⁢∥J⁢x0∥2+(1-α0)⁢∥Jλ0*⁢J⁢x0∥2	
	=	α0⁢(∥p∥2-2⁢α0⁢⟨p,J⁢x0⟩+∥x0∥2)	
		+(1-α0)⁢(∥p∥2-2⁢⟨p,Jλ0*⁢J⁢x0⟩+∥Jλ0*⁢J⁢x0∥2)	
	=	α0⁢V2⁢(p,x0)+(1-α0)⁢V2⁢(p,J-1⁢Jλ0*⁢J⁢x0)	
	=	α0⁢V2⁢(p,x0)+(1-α0)⁢V⁢(p,Jλ0*⁢J⁢x0)	
	≤	α0⁢V2⁢(p,x0)+(1-α0)⁢V⁢(p,J⁢x0)	
	≤	α0⁢V2⁢(p,x0)+(1-α0)⁢V2⁢(p,x0)=V2⁢(p,x0).	

Thus, we give that p∈H0. On the other hand, it is clear that p∈C. Thus, F⊂H0∩W0 and, therefore, x1=ΠH0∩W0 is well defined. Suppose that F⊂Hn-1∩Wn-1 and {xn} is well defined. Then, the methods in (40) imply that V2⁢(p,zn)≤ V2⁢(p,yn)≤V2⁢(p,xn) and p∈Hn. Moreover, it follows from Lemma 3 that

	
⟨p-xn,J⁢xn-J⁢x0⟩≥0,
	

which implies that p∈Wn. Hence F⊂Hn∩Wn and xn+1= ΠHn∩Wn is well defined. Then, by induction, F⊂Hn∩Wn and the sequence generated by (36) is well defined for each n≥0. Now, we show that {xn} is a bounded sequence and converges to a point of F. Let p∈F. Since xn+1=ΠHn∩Wn⁢(x0) and Hn∩Wn⊂Hn-1∩Wn-1 for all n≥1, we have

	
V2⁢(xn,x0)≤V2⁢(xn+1,x0)
	

for all n≥0. Therefore, {V2⁢(xn,x0)} is nondecreasing. In addition, it follows from definition of Wn and Lemma 3 that xn=ΠWn⁢(x0). Therefore, by Lemma 2 we have

	V2⁢(xn,x0)	=V2⁢(∏Wn(x0),x0)	
		≤V2⁢(p,x0)-V2⁢(p,xn)≤V2⁢(p,x0),	

for each p∈F⁢(T)⊂Wn for all n≥0. Therefore, {V2⁢(xn,x0)} is bounded. This together with (40) implies that the limit of {V2⁢(xn,x0)} exists. Put limn→∞⁡V2⁢(xn,x0)=d. From Lemma 2 , we have, for any positive integer m, that

	V2⁢(xn+m,xn)=	V2⁢(xn+m,∏Wn(x0))≤V2⁢(xn+m,x0)	
		-V2⁢(∏Wn(x0),x0)	
	=	V2⁢(xn+m,x0)-V2⁢(xn,x0),	

for all n≥0. The existence of limn→∞⁡V2⁢(xn,x0) implies that limn→∞⁡V2⁢(xm+n,xn)=0. Thus, Lemma 4 implies that

	
xm+n-xn⟶0⁢ as ⁢n⟶∞⁢, 
	

and hence {xn} is a Cauchy sequence. Therefore, there exists a point q∈E such that xn→q as n→∞. Since xn+1∈Hn, we have V2⁢(xn+1,zn)≤V2⁢(xn+1,yn)≤V2⁢(xn+1,xn). Thus by Lemma 4 and (45) we get that

	
xn+1-zn⟶0,xn+1-yn⟶0  as ⁢n⟶∞⁢, 
	

and hence ∥xn-yn∥≤∥xn+1-xn∥+∥xn+1-yn∥→0 as n→∞. Furthermore, since J is uniformly continuous on bounded sets, we have

	
limn→∞⁡∥J⁢xn+1-J⁢zn∥=limn→∞⁡∥J⁢xn-J⁢yn∥=0,
	

which implies that

	
∥J⁢xn+1-J⁢T⁢yn∥⟶ as ⁢n→∞.
	

Since J-1 is also uniformly norm-continuous on bounded sets, we obtain

	
limn→∞⁡∥xn+1-T⁢yn∥=limn→∞⁡∥J-1⁢J⁢xn+1-J-1⁢J⁢T⁢yn∥=0.
	

Therefore, from (46), (49), and ∥yn-T⁢yn∥≤∥xn+1-T⁢yn∥+ ∥xn-yn∥, we obtain that limn→∞⁡∥yn-T⁢yn∥=0. This together with the fact that {xn} (and hence {yn} ) converges strongly to q∈E and the definition of relatively weak nonexpansive mapping implies that q∈F⁢(T). Furthermore, from (36) and (47), we have that (1-αn)⁢∥Jλn*⁢J⁢xn-J⁢xn∥=∥J⁢xn-J⁢yn∥→0 as n→∞. Thus, from limn→∞⁡J⁢Jn*⁢J⁢xn=limn→∞⁡J⁢xn=J⁢q⁢ϵ J⁢A-1⁢0=(A⁢J-1)-1⁢0, we obtain that q∈A-1⁢0.

Finally, we show that q=ΠA-1⁣○∩F⁢(T)⁢(x0) as n→∞. From Lemma 2, we have

	
V2⁢(q,∏A-1⁢0∩F⁢(T)(x0))+V2⁢(∏A-1⁢0∩F⁢(T)(x0),x0)≤V2⁢(q,x0).
	

On the other hand, since xn+1=ΠHn∩Wn⁢(x0) and F⊂Hn∩Wn for all n≥0, we have by Lemma 2 that

		V2⁢(∏A-1⁢0∩F⁢(T)(x0),xn+1)+V2⁢(xn+1,x0)	
		≤V2⁢(∏A-1⁢0∩F⁢(T)(x0),x0).	
		Moreover, by the definition of ⁢V2⁢(x,y), we get that	
		limn→∞⁡V2⁢(xn+1,x0)=V2⁢(q,x0).	

By combining (50) and (52), we obtain that V2⁢(q,x0)= V2⁢(ΠA-1⁢0∩F⁢(T)⁢(x0),x0). Therefore, it follows from the uniqueness of ΠA-1⁢0∩F⁢(T)⁢(x0) that q=ΠA-1⁢0∩F⁢(T)⁢(x0). This completes the proof.

Remark 9. If in Theorem 8 we have that T=I, the identity map on E, then we get the following.

Corollary 10. Let E* be a uniformly convex Banach space and uniformly smooth Banach space. Let A⊂E×E* be a maximal monotone operator. Let C be a nonempty closed convex subset of E with A-1⁢0≠∅. Assume that 0≤αn<a<1 is a sequence of real numbers. Then, the sequence {xn} generated by

	
x0∈C,λn⟶+∞,
yn=J-1⁢(αn⁢J⁢xn+(1-αn)⁢Jλn*⁢J⁢xn),Jλn*=(I*+λn⁢A⁢J-1)-1,
H0={v∈C:V2⁢(v,z0)≤V2⁢(v,y0)≤V2⁢(v,x0)},
Hn={v∈Hn-1∩Wn-1:V2⁢(v,zn)≤V2⁢(v,yn)≤V2⁢(v,xn)},
W0=C,
Wn={v∈Hn-1∩Wn-1:⟨v-xn,J⁢x0-J⁢xn⟩≤0},
xn+1=∏Hn∩Wn(x0),n≥1
	

converges strongly to ΠA-1⁢0, where ΠA-1⁢0 is the generalized projection from E onto A-1⁢0.","Now we construct an iterative scheme which converges strongly to a point which is a fixed point of relatively weak nonexpansive mapping and a zero of monotone mapping.

Theorem 2.4. Let E* be a uniformly convex Banach space and uniformly smooth Banach space. let A⊂E×E* be a maximal monotone operator. Let C be a nonempty closed convex subset of E. Let T:C→C be a relatively weak

74 X.WANG, J.M.CHEN, AND Z.HE nonexpansive mapping with A-1⁢0∩F⁢(T)≠∅. Assume that 0≤αn<a<1 is a sequence of real numbers. Then the sequence {xn} generated by

	
{x0∈C,λn→+∞
yn=J-1⁢(αn⁢J⁢xn+(1-αn)⁢Jλn*⁢J⁢xn),Jλn*=(I*+λn⁢A⁢J-1)-1
zn=T⁢yn,
H0={v∈C:V2⁢(v,z0)≤V2⁢(v,y0)≤V2⁢(v,x0)}
Hn={v∈Hn-1∩Wn-1:V2⁢(v,zn)≤V2⁢(v,yn)≤V2⁢(v,xn)}
W0=C
Wn={v∈Hn-1∩Wn-1:⟨v-xn,J⁢x0-J⁢xn⟩≤0}
xn+1=ΠHn∩Wn⁢(x0),n≥1
	

converges strongly to ΠA-1⁢0∩F⁢(T)⁢(x0), where ΠA-1⁢0∩F⁢(T) is the generalized projection from E onto A-1⁢0∩F⁢(T).

Proof. We first show that Hn and Wn are closed and convex for each n≥0. From the definition of Hn and Wn, it is obvious that Hn is closed and Wn is closed and convex for each n≥0. We show that Hn is convex. Since Hn={v∈Hn-1∩Wn-1:V2⁢(v,zn)≤V2⁢(v,yn)}∩{v∈Hn-1∩Wn-1:V2⁢(v,yn)≤V2⁢(v,xn)}, and that V2⁢(v,yn)≤V2⁢(v,xn) is equivalent to

	
2⁢⟨v,J⁢xn-J⁢yn⟩+∥yn∥2+∥xn∥2≤0,
	

V2⁢(v,zn)≤V2⁢(v,yn) is equivalent to

	
2⁢⟨v,J⁢yn-J⁢zn⟩+∥zn∥2+∥xn∥2≤0,
	

it follows that Hn is convex. Next, we show that F=:A-10∩F(T)⊂Hn∩Wn for each n≥0. Let p∈F, then relatively weak nonexpansiveness of T and generalized nonexpansiveness of Jλ* give that

	V2⁢(p,z0)	=V2⁢(p,T⁢y0)≤V2⁢(p,y0)	
		=V2⁢(p,J-1⁢(α0⁢J⁢x0+(1-α0)⁢Jλ0*⁢J⁢x0))	
		=∥p∥2+∥α0⁢J⁢x0+(1-α0)⁢Jλ0*⁢J⁢x0∥2-2⁢⟨p,α0⁢J⁢x0+(1-α0)⁢Jλ0*⁢J⁢x0⟩	
		≤∥p∥2-2⁢α0⁢⟨p,J⁢x0⟩-2⁢(1-α0)⁢⟨p,Jλ0*⁢J⁢x0⟩+α0⁢∥J⁢x0∥2+(1-α0)⁢∥Jλ0*⁢J⁢x0∥2	
		=α0⁢(∥p∥2-2⁢α0⁢⟨p,J⁢x0⟩+∥x0∥2)+(1-α0)⁢(∥p∥2-2⁢⟨p,Jλ0*⁢J⁢x0⟩+∥Jλ0*⁢J⁢x0∥2)	
		=α0⁢V2⁢(p,x0)+(1-α0)⁢V2⁢(p,J-1⁢Jλ0*⁢J⁢x0)	
		=α0⁢V2⁢(p,x0)+(1-α0)⁢V⁢(p,Jλ0*⁢J⁢x0)	
		≤α0⁢V2⁢(p,x0)+(1-α0)⁢V⁢(p,J⁢x0)	
		≤α0⁢V2⁢(p,x0)+(1-α0)⁢V2⁢(p,x0)=V2⁢(p,x0)	

Thus, we give that p∈H0. On the other hand it is clear that p∈C. Thus F⊂H0∩W0 and therefore, x1=ΠH0∩W0 is well defined. Suppose that F⊂Hn-1∩Wn-1 and {xn} is well defined. Then the methods in (3.2) imply that V2⁢(p,zn)≤V2⁢(p,yn)≤V2⁢(p,xn) and that p∈Hn. Moreover, it follows from Lemma 1.3 that

	
⟨p-xn,J⁢xn-J⁢x0⟩≥0
	




A NEW GENERALIZED RESOLVENT AND APPLICATION 75 which implies that p∈Wn. Hence F⊂Hn∩Wn and xn+1=ΠHn∩Wn is well defined. Then by induction, F⊂Hn∩Wn and the sequence generated by (3.1) is well defined for each n≥0.

Now we show that {xn} is a bounded sequence and converges to a point of F. Let p∈F. Since xn+1=ΠHn∩Wn⁢(x0) and Hn∩Wn⊂Hn-1∩Wn-1 for all n≥1, we have V2⁢(xn,x0)≤V2⁢(xn+1,x0) for all n≥0. Therefore, {V2⁢(xn,x0)} is nondecreasing. In addition, it follows from definition of Wn and Lemma 1.3 that xn=ΠWn⁢(x0). Therefore, by Lemma 1.2 we have

	
V2⁢(xn,x0)=V2⁢(ΠWn⁢(x0),x0)≤V2⁢(p,x0)-V2⁢(p,xn)≤V2⁢(p,x0),
	

for each p∈F⁢(T)⊂Wn for all n≥0. Therefore, {V2⁢(xn,x0)} is bounded. This together with (3.2) implies that the limit of {V2⁢(xn,x0)} exists. Put limn→∞⁡V2⁢(xn,x0)=d. From Lemma 1.2, we have, for any positive integer m, that

	
V2⁢(xn+m,xn)=V2⁢(xn+m,ΠWn⁢(x0))≤V2⁢(xn+m,x0)-V2⁢(ΠWn⁢(x0),x0)
=V2⁢(xn+m,x0)-V2⁢(xn,x0)
	

for all n≥0. The existence of limn→∞⁡V2⁢(xn,x0) implies that limn→∞⁡V2⁢(xm+n,xn)= 0. Thus, Lemma 1.4 implies that

	
xm+n-xn→0  as  n→∞
	

and hence {xn} is a Cauchy sequence. Therefore, there exists a point q∈E such that xn→q as n→∞. Since xn+1∈Hn, we have V2⁢(xn+1,zn)≤ V2⁢(xn+1,yn)≤V2⁢(xn+1,xn). Thus by Lemma 1.4 and (3.4) we get that

	
xn+1-zn→0,xn+1-yn→0  as  n→∞
	

and hence ∥xn-yn∥≤∥xn+1-xn∥+∥xn+1-yn∥→0 as n→∞. Furthermore, since J is uniformly continuous on bounded sets, we have

	
limn→∞⁡∥J⁢xn+1-J⁢zn∥=limn→∞⁡∥J⁢xn-J⁢yn∥=0
	

which implies that

	
∥J⁢xn+1-J⁢T⁢yn∥→0  as  n→∞
	

Since J-1 is also uniformly norm-norm-continuous on bounded sets, we obtain

	
limn→∞⁡∥xn+1-T⁢yn∥=limn→∞⁡∥J-1⁢J⁢xn+1-J-1⁢J⁢T⁢yn∥=0
	

Therefore, from (3.5), (3.8) and ∥yn-T⁢yn∥≤∥xn+1-T⁢yn∥+∥xn-yn∥, we obtain that limn→∞⁡∥yn-T⁢yn∥=0. This together with the fact that {xn} (and hence {yn} ) converges strongly to q∈E and the definition of relatively weak nonexpansive mapping implies that q∈F⁢(T). Furthermore, from (3.1) and (3.6), we have that (1-αn)⁢∥Jλn*⁢J⁢xn-J⁢xn∥=∥J⁢xn-J⁢yn∥→0 as n→∞. Thus, limn→∞⁡Jλn*⁢J⁢xn=limn→∞⁡J⁢xn=J⁢q∈J⁢A-1⁢0=(A⁢J-1)-1⁢0, we obtain

76 X.WANG, J.M.CHEN, AND Z.HE that q∈A-1⁢0.Finally, we show that q=ΠA-1⁢0∩F⁢(T)⁢(x0) as n→∞. From Lemma 1.2, we have

	
V2⁢(q,ΠA-1⁢0∩F⁢(T)⁢(x0))+V2⁢(ΠA-1⁢0∩F⁢(T)⁢(x0),x0)≤V2⁢(q,x0).
	

On the other hand, since xn+1=ΠHn∩Wn⁢(x0) and F⊂Hn∩Wn for all n≥0 we have by Lemma 1.2 that

	
V2⁢(ΠA-1⁢0∩F⁢(T)⁢(x0),xn+1)+V2⁢(xn+1,x0)≤V2⁢(ΠA-1⁢0∩F⁢(T)⁢(x0),x0)⁢. 
	

Moreover, by the definition of V2⁢(x,y) we get that

	
limn→∞⁡V2⁢(xn+1,x0)=V2⁢(q,x0)
	

Combining (3.9),(3.11) we obtain that V2⁢(q,x0)=V2⁢(ΠA-1⁢0∩F⁢(T)⁢(x0),x0). Therefore, it follows from the uniqueness of ΠA-1⁢0∩F⁢(T)⁢(x0) that q=ΠA-1⁢0∩F⁢(T)⁢(x0). Remark 1 . If in Theorem 3.1 we have that T=I, the identity map on E then we get the following: Corollary 2.5. Let E* be a uniformly convex Banach space and uniformly smooth Banach space. let A⊂E×E* be a maximal monotone operator. Let C be a nonempty closed convex subset of E with A-1⁢0≠∅.

"We prove that the value function V⁢(t,x) satisfy a partial differential inequality: the Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman (H-J-B) inequality. The main problem consists in characterizing solutions of this partial differential inequality thanks to some monotonicity properties-dissipative inequality-of the performance function Jγ along suitable trajectories of the system.

When V is smooth-we emphasize that our study includes the non-smooth case-this equality can be written in the following form:

	
-Vt⁢(t,x)+H⁢(t,x,-Vx⁢(t,x),-Vx,x⁢(t,x))=0,∀(t,x)∈R×Rd,
	

where the subscripts denoted partial derivatives and H is the Hamiltonian for the problem and is defined as

	H(t,x,p,P):=infu∈U¯{	trace⁡[P⋅12⁢σ⁢(t,x,u)⁢σT⁢(t,x,u)]	
		+pT⋅b(t,x,u)-f¯(t,x,u)}	

where f¯⁢(t,x,u)=f⁢(t,x,u)-γ2⁢∥x∥2. We recall the definition of dissipative inequality (see [3]) associated to some extended function Y⁢(⋅,⋅):R+×Rd→R∪{∞}. Consider a measurable function u⁢(⋅). If, for any measurable function f, we have

where t2>t1,Xst,x,u is given by (1), then the function Y is called a storage function. The situation of smooth occurs rarely, thus the problem will be reduced to the statement of a criterion in terms of a PDE allowing us to determine storage functions. This is related to a paper of James [4] who proved-in the continuous and deterministic case-that storage functions are viscosity subsolution to some PDE and that any continuous viscosity subsolution is a storage function. In the present work, we prove-in the stochastic casethe equivalence between storage functions, generalized solutions and viscosity solutions

Z. Hou et al. / J. Math. Anal. Appl. 315 (2006) 154-166 157 to the H-J-B in the lower semi-continuous case. We briefly describe how the paper is organized. In Section 2 we introduce the upper generalized Gaussian derivative and some definitions associated with it; in the following section we study stochastic dissipative system and H-J-B equation; in the last section obtain the relation between storage functions, generalized solutions and viscosity solutions. 2. Preliminary The standing assumptions are as follows: 1. b,σ are bounded, continuous on [0,T]×Rd×U and Lipschitz continuous in (t,x) and uniformly in u,σ⁢(t,x,u) is a d×m-dimensional matrix. 2. f is continuous, Lipschitz continuous in (t,x) and uniformly in u, and has at most polynomial growth in x. 3. U is a compact metric space. The first-order generalized directional derivative of a function I at x∈Rd in the direction v∈Rd,I∘⁢(x;v), is defined (at least if I is Lipschitz) by Clarke [5] as

	
I∘⁢(x;v):=lim supy→x,h→0+⁡I⁢(y+v⁢h)-I⁢(y)h.
	

The second-order generalized directional derivative at x has been defined by Cominetti and Correa [6] as a functional on Rd×Rd, i.e.,

	
I∘∘⁢(x;u,v):=lim supy→x,s,t→0⁡I⁢(y+t⁢v+s⁢u)-I⁢(y+t⁢v)-I⁢(y+s⁢u)+I⁢(y)s⁢t.
	

For stochastic control, however, where second-order H-J-B equations arise, it is more convenient to define a second-order derivative and a second-order differential somewhat differently. Let Sd be the symmetric d×d-dimensional matrices and let Pd be the cone of nonnegative semi-definite elements of Sd. Let ℜ∈Rd be an open set and let B⁢M⁢(ℜ) be the set of locally bounded measurable real-valued functions defined on ℜ. For a function I∈B⁢M⁢(ℜ) we provide a differential of I at x as a function on Pd×Rd as follows (see [7]). Definition 2.1. For a∈Pd and b∈Rd the upper, respectively lower, generalized Gaussian derivative of I at x in the direction b with covariance a is

	
IG⁢(x;b,a)=lim sup(s,y)→(t,x),h→0+⁡E⁢{(ϕ⁢I)⁢(y+b⁢h+θ⁢Wh)-I⁢(y)}h,
	

respectively

	IG⁢(x;b,a)	=lim inf(s,y)→(t,x),h→0+⁡E⁢{(ϕ⁢I)⁢(y+b⁢h+θ⁢Wh)-I⁢(y)}h	
		=-(-I)G⁢(x;b,a).	




158 Z. Нои et al. / J. Math. Anal. Appl. 315 (2006) 154-166 We also provide the result as follows without proof (see [7]):

	
IG⁢(x;-b,-a)=(-I)G⁢(x;b,a)=-IG⁢(x;b,a),
	

where ϕ is any infinitely differential function of compact support that is equal to 1 in a neighborhood of x, where θ is any d×m-dimensional matrix such that θ⁢θT=2⁢a and where W is a standard m-dimensional Brownian motion, E stands for expectation.

Remark 1. Our definition is somewhat different from that of [7], however, it makes no difference between them essentially. It can be shown that IG⁢(x;b,a) and IG⁢(x;b,a) are independent of the choice of ϕ,θ,W (see [7, Proposition 3.4]).

Definition 2.2 (see [8]). Let Z∈C([t,T]×Rd ), the right subdifferential (respectively right superdifferential) of Z at (t,x)∈R×Rd, denoted by ∂t+,x1,2,-⁡Z⁢(t,x), respectively ∂t+,x1,2,+⁡Z⁢(t,x), is a set defined by

	
∂t+,x1,2,-⁡Z⁢(t,x)
={(β0,β,α)∈R×Rd×Sd:
lim infy→x,h→0+Z⁢(t+h,y)-Z⁢(t,x)-β0⁢h-βT⁢(y-x)-12⁢(y-x)T⁢α⁢(y-x)h+∥y-x∥2⩾0}
	

respectively

	
∂t+,x1,2,+Z(t,x)={(β0,β,α)∈R×Rd×Sd]dvtlim supy→x,h→0+{…}⩽0},
	

where ∂t+,x1,2,-⁡Z⁢(t,x) denotes first subdifferential in t+, second subdifferential in x with respect to Z⁢(t,x).

Remark 2. To study stochastic control problems, many authors make use of the superdifferential ∂t+,x1,2,+⁡Z⁢(t,x) and subdifferential ∂t+,x1,2,-⁡Z⁢(t,x) obtained by replacing the right-side limit h→0+in the above definition by the two-side limit h→0 (e.g., [9-11]). The right-sided differentials has been studied extensively in [8] and proved to be more useful than the two-sided differential in treating stochastic control problem (see, e.g., [8, Remark 4.1] and [12]). These definitions are related by a lemma. Lemma 2.3. Consider a function φ:[0,T]×Rd→R∪{+∞,-∞}, then

	∂t+,x1,2,-⁡φ⁢(t,x)=	{(β0,β,α)∈R×Rd×Sd:

Z. Hou et al. / J. Math. Anal. Appl. 315 (2006) 154-166 159 Proof. Consider (β0,β,α)∈∂t+,x1,2,-⁡φ⁢(t,x). Given ε>0, there exists δ>0 such that for ∥(s,y)-(t,x)∥⩽δ. For a=12⁢θ⁢θT∈Pd,b∈Rd, let s=t+h,y=x+b⁢h+θ⁢Wh for a suitable Brownian motion. If h is sufficiently small, then by Chebychev’s inequality ∥(s,y)-(t,x)∥⩽δ except on a set of probability measure less than k⁢h2, where k is a constant that may be depend on ε and a but not h. Let ϕ be a smooth function of compact support, equal to one on ∥(s,y)-(t,x)∥⩽δ. Since φ is bounded near (t,x), then from (7) it follows that

	
E⁢ϕ⁢φ⁢(t+h,x+b⁢h+θ⁢Wh)-φ⁢(t,x)
⩾β0⁢h+⟨β,b⟩⁢h+⟨α,a⟩⁢h-ε⁢{h2+∥b∥2⁢h2+2⁢∥a∥⁢h}+o⁢(h2),
	

and hence, after dividing by h, letting h→0+and ε>0, i.e., pass to the upper limit, then

	
φG⁢(t,x;b,a)⩾β0+⟨β,b⟩+⟨α,a⟩.
	

When (β0,β,α)∈∂t+,x1,2,+⁡φ⁢(t,x), the proof is similar and is omitted.","We prove that the value function V⁢(t,x) satisfying a partial differential inequality: the Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman (H-J-B) inequality. The main problem consists in characterizing solutions of this partial differential inequality thanks to some monotonicity properties-dissipative inequality - of the performance function Jγ along suitable trajectories of the system. If V is smooth, it is unique classical solution of the H-J-B, i.e.,

	
-Vt⁢(t,x)+H⁢(t,x,-Vx⁢(t,x),-Vx,x⁢(t,x))=0,∀(t,x)∈R×Rd,
	

where the subscripts denoted partial derivatives and the H is the Hamiltonian for the problem and is defined as

	
H⁢(t,x,p,P):=infu∈U⁡{trace⁡[P⋅12⁢σ⁢(t,x,u)⁢σT⁢(t,x,u)]+pT⋅b⁢(t,x,u)-f¯⁢(t,x,u)},
 where ⁢f¯⁢(t,x,u)=f⁢(t,x,u)-γ2⁢∥x∥2.
	

We recall the definition of dissipative inequality ([14]) associated to some extended function Y⁢(⋅,⋅):R+×Rd→R⁢⋃{∞} : consider a measurable function u⁢(⋅). If, for any measurable function f, we have

	
E⁢Y⁢(t1,Xt1t,x,u)≥E⁢Y⁢(t2,Xt2t,x,u)+E⁢∫t1t2[f⁢(s,Xst,x,u,u⁢(s))-γ2⁢∥x∥2]⁢𝑑s,
	

where t2>t1,Xst,x,u is given by (1), then the function Y is called a storage function.

The situation of smooth occurs rarely, thus the problem will be reduce to the statement of a criterion in terms of a PDE allowing us to determine storage functions. This is related to a paper of James [10] who proved-in the continuous and deterministic case-that storage functions are viscosity subsolution to some PDE and that any continuous viscosity subsolution is a storage function. In the present work, we aim is to find-in the stochastic case-that the relationship between storage functions, generalized solutions and viscosity solutions to the H-J-B in the lower semi-continuous case. We briefly describe how the paper is organized: in the 2 nd section we introduce the upper generalized Gaussian derivative and some definitions associated with it; in the following section we study stochastic dissipative system and H-J-B equation; in the last section we

532 YONG ZHOU, ZHENGMEI HOU AND SANYANG LIU discuss the relationship each other of storage functions, generalized solutions and viscosity solutions. 2. Preliminary The standing assumptions are as follows: 1. b,σ are bounded, continuous on [0,T]×Rd×U and Lipschitz continuous in (t,x) and uniformly in u,σ⁢(t,x,u) is a d×m dimensional matrix; 2. f is continuous, Lipschitz continuous in (t,x) and uniformly in u, and has at most polynomial growth in x; 3. U is a compact metric space. The first-order generalized directional derivative of a function I at x∈Rd in the direction v∈Rd,I∘⁢(x;v), is defined (at least if I is Lipschitz) by Clarke [2] as

	
I∘⁢(x;v):=lim supy→x,h→0+⁡I⁢(y+v⁢h)-I⁢(y)h.
	

The second-order generalized directional derivative at x has been defined by Cominetti and Correa [3] as a functional on Rd×Rd, i.e.,

	
I∘∘⁢(x;u,v):=lim supy→x,s,t→0⁡I⁢(y+t⁢v+s⁢u)-I⁢(y+t⁢v)-I⁢(y+s⁢u)+I⁢(y)s⁢t.
	

For stochastic control, however, where second-order H-J-B equations arise, it is more convenient to define a second-order derivative and a second-order differential somewhat differently. Let Sd be the symmetric d×d dimensional matrices and let Pd be the cone of nonnegative semi-definite elements of Sd. Let ℜ∈Rd be an open set and let B⁢M⁢(ℜ) be the set of locally bounded measurable real-valued functions defined on ℜ. For a function I∈B⁢M⁢(ℜ) we provide a differential of I at x as a function on Pd×Rd as follows ([7]).

Definition 2.1. For a∈Pd and b∈Rd the upper (resp., lower) generalized Gaussian derivative of I at x in the direction b with covariance a is

	
IG⁢(x;b,a)=lim sup(s,y)→(t,x),h→0+⁡E⁢{(ϕ⁢I)⁢(y+b⁢h+θ⁢Wh)-I⁢(y)}h,

we also provide the result as follows without proof ([7])

	
IG⁢(x;-b,-a)=(-I)G⁢(x;b,a)=-IG⁢(x;b,a),
	

where ϕ is any infinitely differential function of compact support that is equal to 1 in a neighborhood of x, where θ is any d×m dimensional matrix such that θ⁢θT=2⁢a and where W is a standard m dimensional Brownian motion, E stands for expectation.

Remark 1. Our definition is somewhat different from that of [7], however, it makes no difference between them essentially. It can be shown that IG⁢(x;b,a) and IG⁢(x;b,a) are independent of the choice of ϕ,θ,W ([7], Prop. 3.4).

Definition 2.2. ([15]) Let Z∈C⁢([t,T]×Rd), the right subdifferential (resp., right superdifferential) of Z at (t,x)∈R×Rd, denoted by ∂t+,x1,2,-⁡Z⁢(t,x) (resp., ∂t+,x1,2,+Z(t,x)), is a set defined by

	
∂t+,x1,2,-Z(t,x)={(β0,β,α)∈R×Rd×Sd:
lim infy→x,h→0+Z⁢(t+h,y)-Z⁢(t,x)-β0⁢h-βT⁢(y-x)-12⁢(y-x)T⁢α⁢(y-x)h+∥y-x∥2≥0}
( resp., ⁢∂t+,x1,2,+⁡Z⁢(t,x)={(β0,β,α)∈R×Rd×Sd:lim supy→x,h→0+⁡{⋯}≤0}),
	

where ∂t+,x1,2,-⁡Z⁢(t,x) denotes first subdifferential in t+, second subdifferential in x with respect to Z⁢(t,x).

Remark 2. To study stochastic control problems, many authors make use of the superdifferential ∂t+,x1,2,+⁡Z⁢(t,x) and subdifferential ∂t+,x1,2,-⁡Z⁢(t,x) obtained by replacing the right-side limit h→0+in the above definition by the two-side limit h→0 (e.g., [5, 12, 13]). The right-sided differentials has been studied extensively in [15] and proved to be more useful than the two-sided differential in treating stochastic control problem (e.g., [15, Remark 4.1] and [8]). These definitions are related by a lemma.

534 YONG ZHOU, ZHENGMEI HOU AND SANYANG LIU Lemma 2.3. Consider a function φ:[0,T]×Rd→R⁢⋃{+∞,-∞}, then

where a=12⁢θ⁢θT, we write ⟨e,f⟩ for eT⋅f  if e,f∈Rd and for trace (e⋅f) if e,f∈Sd.

Proof. Consider (β0,β,α)∈∂t+,x1,2,-⁡φ⁢(t,x). Given ε>0, there exists δ>0 such that for ∥(s,y)-(t,x)∥≤δ. For a=12⁢θ⁢θT∈Pd,b∈Rd, let s=t+h,y=x+b⁢h+θ⁢Wh for a suitable Brownian motion. If h is sufficiently small, then by Chebychev’s inequality ∥(s,y)-(t,x)∥≤δ except on a set of probability measure less than k⁢h2, where k is a constant that may be depend on ε and a but not h. Let ϕ be a smooth function of compact support, equal to one on ∥(s,y)-(t,x)∥≤δ. Since φ is bounded near (t,x), then from (7) it follows that

≥β0⁢h+⟨β,b⟩⁢h+⟨α,a⟩⁢h-ε⁢{h2+∥b∥2⁢h2+2⁢∥a∥⁢h}+o⁢(h2),
	

and hence, after dividing by h, letting h→0+and ε>0, i.e., pass to the upper limit, then

	
φG⁢(t,x;b,a)≥β0+⟨β,b⟩+⟨α,a⟩.

In what follows, we prove that lower and upper envelopes of a storage function are again storage functions.

Proposition 3.2. If V is a storage function, then so are its lower and upper envelopes V* and V*.

Recall that the lower/upper envelope V*,V* of V is the largest lower/smallest upper semicontinuous function which is smaller/greater than V. In a shorter way, Epi⁡(V*) is the closure of the epigraph of V:Epi⁡(V*):=cl⁡(Epi⁡V). The upper envelope V* is defined by considering the hypograph: Hypo V*:=cl( Hypo V ).

Proof. Fix u∈Lloc 2, let t1⩽t2. By the very definition of V*, there exists a sequence (tn,xn)n converging to (t1,x1) such that

	
lim inf(t,y)→(t1,x1)⁡V⁢(t,y)=lim infn→∞⁡V⁢(tn,xn)=V*⁢(t1,x1).
	

We consider a sequence xn⁢(⋅) corresponding to the fixed u⁢(⋅) such that xn⁢(tn)=xn for any n⩾0. Since V is a storage function one gets, for any t,

	
V⁢(tn,xn)⩾V⁢(t,xn⁢(t))+E⁢∫tnt[f⁢(s,Xn⁢(s),u⁢(s))-γ2⁢∥x∥2]⁢𝑑s.
	

By Gronwall’s lemma and (1), ∥Xn(s)-X(s)∥rv(∥⋅∥rv denotes the norm of random variable) converges uniformly to 0 on [t1,t]. So passing to the lower limit in the previous inequality we obtain

	
V*⁢(t1,x1)⩾lim infn→∞⁡{V⁢(t,xn⁢(t))+E⁢∫tnt[f⁢(s,Xn⁢(s),u⁢(s))-γ2⁢∥x∥2]⁢𝑑s}.
	




Z. Нои et al. / J. Math. Anal. Appl. 315 (2006) 154-166 161 However, lim infn→∞V(t,xn(t))⩾lim inf(s,y)→(t,x⁢(t))V(s,y)=:V*(t,x(t)), and since f is continuous we can deduce from Lebesgue’s theorem and from the standing assumption 2 that

	
V*⁢(t1,x1)⩾V*⁢(t,x⁢(t))+E⁢∫t1t[f⁢(s,X1⁢(s),u⁢(s))-γ2⁢∥x∥2]⁢𝑑s,
	

for any t. By taking t=t2 yields

	
V*⁢(t1,x1)⩾V*⁢(t2,x⁢(t2))+E⁢∫t1t2[f⁢(s,X1⁢(s),u⁢(s))-γ2⁢∥x∥2]⁢𝑑s.
	

The proof for the upper envelope V* is very similar and is omitted. Because of the above result, we only study lower semicontinuous storage functions.

Theorem 3.3. Assume that the standing assumptions 1,2 hold true. If V∈Wloc1,2,∞(Wm,p denotes Sobolev space) is a storage function, then, for all (t,x)∈Dom⁡(V),

	
{supu∈U⁡VG⁢(t,x;b,a)+f¯⁢(t,x,u)⩽0,
supu∈U⁡(-V)G⁢(t,x;-b,-a)+f¯⁢(t,x,u)⩽0,
	

where b=b⁢(t,x,u),σ=σ⁢(t,x,u),a=12⁢σ⁢σT,f¯⁢(t,x,u)=f⁢(t,x,u)-γ2⁢∥x∥2. Proof. Firstly, we prove the first inequality. Consider the system (1), we have

	
Xrt,x,u=x+∫0rb⁢(t+s,Xst,x,u,u⁢(s))⁢𝑑s+∫0rσ⁢(t+s,Xst,x,u,u⁢(s))⁢𝑑Ws,
	

with

	
Jt,x⁢(u)=E⁢∫0T-tf~⁢(t,x,u)⁢𝑑s.
	

The corresponding value function is

	
V⁢(t,x)=supu∈U¯⁡Jt,x⁢(u),
	

where U¯ is the set of U-valued progressively measurable stochastic process on [0,T]. When value function V⁢(t,x)=infu∈U¯⁡Jt,x⁢(u), it follows from a generalized dynamic programming argument [13, Propositions 5.9 and 5.11] that

	
Γ~rt,x,u:=∫0rf~⁢(t,x,u)⁢𝑑s+V⁢(t+r,Xrt,x,u)
	

is a submartingale for any u∈U¯ and is a martingale if and only if u is optimal.

162 Z. Hou et al. / J. Math. Anal. Appl. 315 (2006) 154-166 When value function is (9), we can easily obtain by using the same methods of [13, Propositions 5.9 and 5.11] that

	
Γrt,x,u:=∫0rf~⁢(t,x,u)⁢𝑑s+V⁢(t+r,Xrt,x,u)
	

is a supermartingale for any u∈U¯ and is a martingale if and only if u is optimal. Hence we have for any u∈U¯

	
E⁢(Γrt,x,u∣F0)⩽Γ0t,x,u,
	

namely

	
E⁢V⁢(t+r,Xrt,x,u)⩽V⁢(t,x)-E⁢∫0rf~⁢(t,x,u)⁢𝑑s.
	

Let us take u⁢(⋅) and u constant in (8), for h>0, then

ρ2=∫0h[σ⁢(s+r,Xrs,y,u,u)-σ⁢(t,x,u)]⁢𝑑Wr.
	

Observe that the Lipschitz continuity in x of b and standard estimation show that

	
h-1⁢ρ1=g⁢(s,y),
	

where g⁢(s,y) is a random function such that

	
lim(s,y)→(t,x),h→0+⁡E⁢|g⁢(s,y)|2=0.
	

Similarly

	
h-1/2⁢ρ2=g⁢(s,y).
	

For the sake of clarity, we write b⁢(t,x,u),σ⁢(t,x,u) as b,σ, respectively, in the following proof, now,

	V⁢(s+h,Xhs,y,u)-V⁢(s,y)=	[V(s+h,y+hb+σWh+ρ1+ρ2)	
		-V(s+h,y+hb+σWh)]	
		+[V⁢(s+h,y+h⁢b+σ⁢Wh)-V⁢(s,y)]	
	=	Δ⁢V+[V⁢(s+h,y+h⁢b+σ⁢Wh)-V⁢(s,y)].	

But Vx is locally Lipschitz-continuous, so

Z. Нои et al. / J. Math. Anal. Appl. 315 (2006) 154-166 163

	Δ⁢V=	[Vx⁢(s+h,y+h⁢b+σ⁢Wh+ξ⁢(ρ1+ρ2))]⁢(ρ1+ρ2)	
	=	Vx(s+h,y)(ρ1+ρ2)+[Vx(s+h,y+hb+σWh+ξ(ρ1+ρ2))	
		-Vx(s+h,y)](ρ1+ρ2)	

where ξ is a random variable assuming values in (0,1). Set

	
Δ1⁢V=Vx⁢(s+h,y+h⁢b+σ⁢Wh+ξ⁢(ρ1+ρ2))-Vx⁢(s+h,y).
	

Then

	
Δ1⁢V⩽K⁢|h⁢b+σ⁢Wh+ξ⁢(ρ1+ρ2)|⩽K1⁢{|h|+|Wh|+|ρ1|+|ρ2|}
	

and hence

	
lim(s,y)→(t,x),h→0+⁡h-1⁢E⁢Δ⁢V=0.
	

If now we set a=12⁢σ⁢σT, then it follows from (5), (12), (15) and (16) that

	VG⁢(t,x;b,a)	=lim sup(s,y)→(t,x),h→0+⁡h-1⁢E⁢{ϕ⁢V⁢(s+h,Xhs,y,u)-V⁢(s,y)}

	=	lim sup(s,y)→(t,x),h→0+⁡h-1⁢E⁢{V⁢(s+h,y+h⁢b+σ⁢Wh)-V⁢(s,y)}	
	⩽	-lim sup(s,y)→(t,x),h→0+⁡h-1⁢E⁢∫0hf~⁢(s,x,u)⁢𝑑s	
		=-f¯⁢(t,x,u)	

(the ϕ can be omitted since V has at most polynomial growth). Since u is arbitrary, we obtain the first inequality. The proof of the second inequality is very similar and is omitted.","Proposition 3.1. There exists a control u and a proper initial value x such that (3) holds if and only if V⁢(t,x) is a storage function, i.e., V⁢(t,x) satisfying (4).

Proof. Consider 0≤t1≤t2≤T2. Denote by ℧⁢(t1) the set of measurable controls on [t1,T2] whose restriction to [t1,t2] is equal to u, then

	
V⁢(t1,x1)=supu¯∈℧⁢(t1)⁡Jγ⁢(t1,x1,u¯)
=supu¯∈℧⁢(t1)⁡{E⁢∫t1t2[f⁢(s,Xst,x,u¯,u¯⁢(s))-γ2⁢∥x∥2]⁢𝑑s+Jγ⁢(t2,x2,u¯)}

 Hence ⁢V⁢(t1,x1)≥V⁢(t2,x2)+E⁢∫t1t2f~⁢(t,x,u)⁢𝑑s⁢. 
	

In what follows, we prove that lower and upper envelopes of a storage function are again storage functions.

Proposition 3.2. If V is a storage function, then so are its lower and upper envelopes V*,V*.

Recall that the lower/upper envelope V*,V* of V is the largest lower/smallest upper semicontinuous function which is smaller/greater than V. In a shorter way, Epi⁡(V*) is the closure of the epigraph of V:Epi⁡(V*):=c⁢l⁢(EpiV). The upper envelope V* is defined by considering the hypograph: H⁢y⁢p⁢o⁢V*:=c⁢l⁢(H⁢y⁢p⁢o⁢V).

536 YONG ZHOU, ZHENGMEI HOU AND SANYANG LIU Proof. Fix u∈Ll⁢o⁢c2, let t1≤t2. By the very definition of V*, there exists a sequence (tn,xn)n converging to (t1,x1) such that

	
lim inf(t,y)→(t1,x1)⁡V⁢(t,y)=lim infn→∞⁡V⁢(tn,xn)=V*⁢(t1,x1).
	

We consider a sequence xn⁢(⋅) - corresponding to the fixed u⁢(⋅) such that xn⁢(tn)=xn for any n≥0. Since V is a storage function one gets, for any t,

	
V⁢(tn,xn)≥V⁢(t,xn⁢(t))+E⁢∫tnt[f⁢(s,Xn⁢(s),u⁢(s))-γ2⁢∥x∥2]⁢𝑑s
	

By Gronwall’s lemma and (1), ∥Xn(s)-X(s)∥r.v(∥⋅∥r.v denotes the norm of random variable) converges uniformly to 0 on [t1,t]. So passing to the lower limit in the previous inequality we obtain

	
V*⁢(t1,x1)≥lim infn→∞⁡{V⁢(t,xn⁢(t))+E⁢∫tnt[f⁢(s,Xn⁢(s),u⁢(s))-γ2⁢∥x∥2]⁢𝑑s}.
	

However, lim infn→∞V(t,xn(t))≥lim inf(s,y)→(t,x⁢(t))V(s,y)=:V*(t,x(t)), and since f is continuous we can deduce from Lebesgue’s theorem and from the standing assumption 2 that

for any t. By taking t=t2 yields

	
V*⁢(t1,x1)≥V*⁢(t2,x⁢(t2))+E⁢∫t1t2[f⁢(s,X1⁢(s),u⁢(s))-γ2⁢∥x∥2]⁢𝑑s.
	

The proof for the upper envelope V* is very similar and is omitted. Because of the above result, we only study lower semicontinuous storage functions.

DISSIPATIVE CONTROL SYSTEM FOR THE STOCHASTIC H∞ PROBLEMS 537 Proof. Firstly, we prove the first inequality. Consider the system (1), we have

	
Xrt,x,u=x+∫0rb⁢(t+s,Xst,x,u,u⁢(s))⁢𝑑s+∫0rσ⁢(t+s,Xst,x,u,u⁢(s))⁢𝑑Ws,
	

with

	
Jt,x⁢(u)=E⁢∫0T-tf~⁢(t,x,u)⁢𝑑s.
	

The corresponding value function is

	
V⁢(t,x)=supu∈U⁡Jt,x⁢(u).
	

When value function V⁢(t,x)=infu∈U⁡Jt,x⁢(u), it follows from a generalized dynamic programming argument, [9, Props. 5.9 and 5.11], that

	
Γ~rt,x,u:=∫0rf~⁢(t,x,u)⁢𝑑s+V⁢(t+r,Xrt,x,u)
	

is a submartingale for any u∈U and is a martingale if and only if u is optimal. When value function is (9), we can easily obtain by using the same methods of [9, Props. 5.9 and 5.11] that

	
Γrt,x,u:=∫0rf~⁢(t,x,u)⁢𝑑s+V⁢(t+r,Xrt,x,u)
	

is a suppermartingale for any u∈U and is a martingale if and only if u is optimal. Hence we have for any u∈U

	
E⁢(Γrt,x,u∣F0)≤Γ0t,x,u,
	

namely

	
E⁢V⁢(t+r,Xrt,x,u)≤V⁢(t,x)-E⁢∫0rf~⁢(t,x,u)⁢𝑑s.
	

Let us take u⁢(⋅) in (8), for h>0, then

	Xhs,y,u	=y+∫0hb⁢(s+r,Xrs,y,u,u)⁢𝑑s+∫0hσ⁢(s+r,Xrs,y,u,u)⁢𝑑Wr	
		=y+h⁢b⁢(t,x,u)+σ⁢(t,x,u)⁢Wh+ρ1+ρ2,	

where

	
{ρ1=∫0h[b⁢(s+r,Xrs,y,u,u)-b⁢(t,x,u)]⁢𝑑s,
ρ2=∫0h[σ⁢(s+r,Xrs,y,u,u)-σ⁢(t,x,u)]⁢𝑑Wr.
	




538 YONG ZHOU, ZHENGMEI HOU AND SANYANG LIU Observe that the Lipschitz continuity in x of b and standard estimation show that

	
h-1⁢ρ1=g⁢(s,y),
	

where g⁢(s,y) is a random function such that

	
lim(s,y)→(t,x),h→0+⁡E⁢|g⁢(s,y)|2=0.
	

Similarly

	
h-12⁢ρ2=g⁢(s,y).
	

For the sake of clarity, we write b⁢(t,x,u),σ⁢(t,x,u) as b,σ respectively in the following proof, now,

	V⁢(s+h,Xhs,y,u)-V⁢(s,y)=	[V(s+h,y+hb+σWh+ρ1+ρ2)-V(s+h,y+	
		hb+σWh)]+[V(s+h,y+hb+σWh)-V(s,y)]	
	=	Δ⁢V+[V⁢(s+h,y+h⁢b+σ⁢Wh)-V⁢(s,y)].	

But Vx is locally lipschitz continuous, so

	Δ⁢V=	[Vx⁢(s+h,y+h⁢b+σ⁢Wh+ξ⁢(ρ1+ρ2))]⁢(ρ1+ρ2)	
	=	Vx⁢(s+h,y)⁢(ρ1+ρ2)	
		+[Vx⁢(s+h,y+h⁢b+σ⁢Wh+ξ⁢(ρ1+ρ2))-Vx⁢(s+h,y)]⁢(ρ1+ρ2)	

where ξ is a random variable assuming values in (0,1). Set

	
Δ1⁢V=Vx⁢(s+h,y+h⁢b+σ⁢Wh+ξ⁢(ρ1+ρ2))-Vx⁢(s+h,y)
	

Then

	
Δ1⁢V≤K⁢|h⁢b+σ⁢Wh+ξ⁢(ρ1+ρ2)|≤K1⁢{|h|+|Wh|+|ρ1|+|ρ2|}
	

and hence

	
lim(s,y)→(t,x),⁡hh→0+⁢h-1⁢E⁢Δ⁢V=0.

respectively. The relative degree ki, satisfies Lgi⁢Lfki-1⁢hi⁢(𝒙)≠0, and Lgi⁢Lfn⁢hi⁢(𝒙)=0 for n=1,2,…⁢(ki-2). Assuming n2,1,n5,1≠0,k1,k2=4,

This leads to the input/output decoupled signals ϕ2(4)=v1, ϕ5(4)=v2 where ϕi(k) denotes the kt⁢h time derivative of ϕi.","4.1 Input-output linearization

The input-output linearization is applied for the development of a decoupled linear integral system, upon which the linear control techniques can be applied over the entire range of operation. This section starts with the linearization of the muscle model firstly, and then proceeds to the supported arm system.

The development of an input-output linearizing controller is a progressive procedure with the necessity that the system be represented into the state space form 𝒙˙=𝒇⁢(𝒙)+𝒈⁢(𝒙)⁢𝒖,

𝒚=𝒉⁢(𝒙),

with 𝒙 the state variable, 𝒖 the input and 𝒚 the output of the system. The corresponding linearizing controller is designed as

u=𝜷⁢(x)-1⁢(-𝜶⁢(𝒙)+𝒗)

where 𝒗 is the new control input to achieve stability and trajectory tracking, and 𝜶,𝜷 are defined by

𝜶⁢(𝒙)=(Lfρ⁢𝒉i⁢(𝒙))i,

𝜷⁢(𝒙)=(L𝒈j⁢Lfρ-1⁢𝒉i⁢(𝒙))i⁢j,

with i,j=1,…,m,m the number of inputs of the system, and ρ the relative degree of the system. Lf⁢𝒉i⁢(𝒙),L𝒈j⁢𝒉i⁢(𝒙) are, respectively, the Lie Derivative of 𝒉i⁢(𝒙) along 𝒇⁢(𝒙) and of 𝒉i⁢(𝒙) along 𝒈j⁢(𝒙), which are defined as Lf⁢𝒉i⁢(𝒙)=∂⁡𝒉i∂⁡𝒙⁢𝒇⁢(𝒙),Lgj⁢𝒉i⁢(𝒙) =∂⁡𝒉i∂⁡𝒙⁢𝒈j⁢(𝒙)

Substituting the linearizing controller (13) into the (12) reduces the input-output map to

𝒚(ρ)=𝒗

which is a chain of ρ integrators.

The input-output linearization is firstly implemented on the muscle dynamics, whose nonlinear part, the isometric recruitment curve, is assumed to be ideal [20], and therefore, its influ. ace can be canceled by direct multiplication wi. to 𝒉IRC-1⁢(𝒖). By introducing the state space do iption of the assumed muscle dynamics

𝒙˙i=[0	1
0	0]⁢𝒙i+[0
1]⁢hIRU,i⁢(ui),

𝒚i=[1	0]⁢𝒙i,i∈{2,5},

the expression (11) for the dynamics of the mechanical support and the stimulated muscle can then be rewritten in the form

𝒙˙=𝒇⁢(𝒙)+𝒈⁢(𝒙)⁢𝒉IRC⁢(𝒖),

𝒚=𝒉⁢(𝒙) where 𝒙=[𝚽T⁢𝚽˙T⁢𝒙2T⁢𝒙5T]T,𝒖=[u2⁢u5]T and

𝒇⁢(𝒙)=[𝚽˙

Standard analysis now gives the linearizing controls for the complete system

"Theorem 1. Suppose that ω⁢(0,η1*,t)=0 for t≥0, i.e. (0,η1*) is an equilibrium of the full system (13) - (15), and η1* is an equilibrium of the zero dynamics (18), and that A is stable. Then (0,η1*) of the full system (13) - (15) is locally stable if η1* is locally stable for the zero dynamics (18).

Proof. This uses the Center Manifold Theorem, see [13].

Stability of the complete system (5) is hence assured if both the actuated and unactuated subsystems are independently stable. The former is guaranteed by the linearizing controller, and the following theorem ensures the latter.

Theorem 2. A sufficient condition for the zero dynamics to be stable is that the function FS⁢(⋅) is passive, that is

and the function Fv⁢(⋅) satisfies the sector bound

		+BU⁢C⁢(Φ)⁢Φ¨C=0

T","Lemma 2 Suppose that ω⁢(0,η,t)=0 for t≥0, namely, (0,η*) is an equilibrium point for the full system (33-35), and η*=[η1*,0]T is an equilibrium point of the zero dynamics (43). Given that the externally observable system (33) is stable, namely, 𝑨 is non-singular, then (0,η*) is locally stable for the full system if η* is locally stable for the zero dynamics (43).

Proof of Lemma 2, see [36].

Stability of the full system (33-35) is guaranteed if both the actuated (external) and unactuated (internal) subsystems are independently stable, the former of which is assured by the cascade controller, and the latter is stabilized by the following theorem.

Theorem A sufficient condition for the zero dynamics to be stable is that the function FS⁢(⋅) is passive, namely,

Fs⁢(ϕi)≥0,i∈NU

and the function Fv⁢(⋅) satisfies the boundary condition

Fv⁢(ϕ˙i)⁢{>F¯v⁢(i)⁢ϕ˙i	ϕ˙i>0
<F¯v⁢(i)⁢ϕ˙i	ϕ˙i≤0

with coefficient

F¯v(⋅=∑t⁢j|∑j=1NCcNU⁢(i),NC⁢(k),NU⁢(j)ϕ^¨NC⁢(k)| i,j∈NU.

Proof According to (36), the unactuated dynamics is given by

		+𝑭U⁢(Φ,Φ˙)+𝑩UC⁢(Φ)⁢Φ¨C=𝟎.	

In view of the specific formation of 𝑪⁢(𝚽,𝚽˙) in (5), the term can be partitioned as

𝑪UC⁢(Φ,Φ˙)=𝑪¯UC⁢(Φ,Φ˙C)+𝑪¯UC⁢(Φ,Φ˙U)

with

C¯UC⁢(i,j)=∑k=1nCCNU⁢(i),NC⁢(j)⁢ϕ˙NC⁢(k),

C¯UC⁢(i,j)=∑k=1nUCNU⁢(i),NC⁢(j)⁢ϕ˙NU⁢(k),

where ϕ˙NC⁢(k)⁢ϕ˙NU⁢(k) denote the relative values of Φ˙C and Φ˙U.

Again, in w or ane special structure of C⁢(Φ,Φ˙)⁢Φ˙ in (37), each ely ent of C¯UC⁢(Φ,Φ˙U)⁢Φ˙C is derived as

12⁢∑l=1nC∑k=1nUCNU⁢(i),NC⁢(j)⁢ϕ˙NU⁢(k)⁢ϕ˙NC⁢(l)

which is equivalent to C¯U⁢(Φ,Φ˙C)⁢Φ˙U with each element

12⁢∑k=1nU∑l=1nCCNU⁢(i),NU⁢(j)⁢ϕ˙NC⁢(l)⁢ϕ˙NU⁢(k).

Thus, (47) can be rewritten as

where 𝑪→U⁢(Φ,Φ˙):=𝑪U⁢(Φ,Φ˙)+𝑪¯U⁢(Φ,Φ˙C)

Now, setting ξ=𝟎 yields the zero dynamics corresponding to the full system

Equivalently, (54) is rewritten as

he equilibrium point satisfies h⁢(η1*,0)+g⁢(η1*)=0, and, from [14], the system can be interpreted as the conservative system η˙2+g⁢(η~1)=0 acted upon by an external force -h⁢(η~1,η2) where η~1=η1-η1*. Accordingly, introduce the potential energy function V⁢(η~1,η2)=

The first term corresponds to the kinetic energy in the unactuated joint system, and the second corresponds to its potential energy and is positive definite via (19). The third is the potential energy transferred from the actuated joints which is assumed to be bounded in a finite time.

As 12⁢B˙U⁢(η1)-CU⁢(η~1,η2) is skew-symmetric, a sufficient condition is that C¯U⁢(η~1,η2)+F¯v is diagonally dominant with positive diagonal entries, which is satisfied by (20).

Condition (21) can always be met by adding damping to the unactuated joints. From (21) bounds on Fv scale with Φ^C(1), and hence (19) and (20) are relaxed if |Φ^C(1)| is small.","The equilibrium point, (η1*,η2*)T, of the zero dynamics (58), satisfies 𝒉~⁢(η1*,0)+𝒈~⁢(η1*)=𝟎, which can be interpreted as the conservative system 𝜼˙2+𝒈~⁢(ζ)=𝝉 actuated upon by the external force τ=-𝒉~⁢(ζ,η2) with ζ=η1-η1*.

According to the Lyapunov’s direct method, the total mechanical energy of the system can be represented with the function candidate

The first term corresponds unactuated system dynamics, he second term denotes its potential energy and is positive definite via (44), and the third term is the potential energy transferred from the actuated joints which are assumed to be bounded in a finite time.

The derivative of V⁢(ζ,𝜼2) with respect to time is

It is required that V˙⁢(ζ,η2)≤0 for stability, which is equivalent to

Thus, a sufficient condition for (64) is that 𝑪~U⁢(ζ)+ 𝑭¯v⁢(𝜼2) is diagonally dominant with positive entries, which is ensured by (45), (46).

The proposed approach for solving this problem uses few numbers of basis and benefits of the orthogonality of block-pulse functions and the advantages of orthonormal Bernstein polynomials properties to reduce the nonlinear integrodifferential equation to easily solvable nonlinear algebraic equations.

Finally conclusions are given in Section 5.

4 Properties of Hybrid Functions

2.1. Hybrid of Block-Pulse Functions and Orthonormal Bernstein Polynomials. The Bernstein polynomials of nth degree are defined on the interval [0,1] as [16]

	
Bi,n⁢(x)=(n
i)⁢xi⁢(1-x)n-i, for ⁢i=0,1,2,…,n,
	

where

	
(n
i)=n!i!⁢(n-i)!.
	

There are (n+1)⁢nth degree Bernstein polynomials. Using Gram-Schmidt orthonormalization process on Bi,n⁢(x), we obtain a class of orthonormal polynomials from the Bernstein polynomials. We call them orthonormal Bernstein polynomials of degree n and denote them by bi,n⁢(x),0≤i≤n. For n=3, the four orthonormal Bernstein polynomials are given by

	
b0,3⁢(x)=-7⁢[x3-3⁢x2+3⁢x-1],
b1,3⁢(x)=5⁢[7⁢x3-15⁢x2+9⁢x-1],
b2,3⁢(x)=-3⁢[21⁢x3-33⁢x2+13⁢x-1],
b3,3⁢(x)=35⁢x3-45⁢x2+15⁢x-1.
	

Hybrid functions hj⁢i⁢(x),j=1,2,…,m and i=0,1,…,n are defined on the interval [0,1) as

	
hj⁢i⁢(x)={m⁢bi,n⁢(m⁢x-j+1),	j-1m≤x<jm,
0,	 otherwise, 
	

where j and n are the order of block-pulse functions and degree of orthonormal Bernstein polynomials, respectively.

It is clear that these sets of hybrid functions in (6) are orthonormal and disjoint.

2.2. Functions Approximation. A function y⁢(x)∈L2⁢[0,1) may be approximated as

	
y⁢(x)≈∑j=1m∑i=0ncj⁢i⁢hj⁢i⁢(x)=𝐂T⁢𝐇⁢(x),
	

where

	
𝐂=[𝐂1T,𝐂2T,…,𝐂jT,…,𝐂mT]T,
𝐂j=[cj⁢0,cj⁢1,cj⁢2,…,cj⁢n]T,j=1,2,…,m,
𝐇⁢(x)=[𝐇1T⁢(x),𝐇2T⁢(x),…,𝐇jT⁢(x),…,𝐇mT⁢(x)]T,
	

and 𝐇j⁢(x)=[hj⁢0⁢(x),hj⁢1⁢(x),…,hj⁢n⁢(x)]T,j=1,2,…,m. The constant coefficients cj⁢i are (y⁢(x),hj⁢i⁢(x)),i=0,1,2,…,n, j=1,2,…,m, and (⋅,⋅) is the standard inner product on L2⁢[0,1)

We can also approximate the function k(x,t)∈L2([0,1)× [0,1)) by

	
k⁢(x,t)≈∑i=1m∑j=1m∑l=0n∑r=0nkl⁢ri⁢j⁢hi⁢l⁢(x)⁢hj⁢r⁢(t)=𝐇T⁢(x)⁢𝐊𝐇⁢(t),
	

where 𝐊=[𝐊i⁢j] is an m⁢(n+1)×m⁢(n+1) matrix, such that the elements of the sub matrix 𝐤i⁢j are

	
kl⁢ri⁢j=∫i-1/mi/m∫j-1/mj/mk⁢(x,t)⁢hi⁢(l-1)⁢(x)⁢hj⁢(r-1)⁢(t)⁢𝑑x⁢𝑑t,
l,r=1,2,…,n+1,i,j=1,2,…,m,
	

utilizing properties of block-pulse function and orthonormal Bernstein polynomials.

2.3. Convergence Analysis. In this section, the error bound and convergence is established by the following lemma.

Lemma 1. Suppose that f∈C(n+1)⁢[0,1) is n+1 times continuously differentiable function such that f=∑j=1mfj, and let Yj=Span⁡{hj⁢0⁢(x),hj⁢1⁢(x),…,hj⁢n⁢(x)},j=1,2,…,m. If 𝐂jT⁢𝐇j⁢(x) is the best approximation to fj from Yj, then 𝐂T⁢𝐇⁢(x) approximates f with the following error bound:

	
∥f-𝐂T⁢𝐇⁢(x)∥2≤γmn+1⁢(n+1)!⁢2⁢n+3,
γ=maxx⁣∈⁣[0.1)⁡|f(n+1)⁢(x)|.
	

Proof. The Taylor expansion for the function fj⁢(x) is

	
f~j⁢(x)=fj⁢(j-1m)+fj′⁢(j-1m)⁢(x-j-1m)
+⋯+fj(n)⁢(j-1m)⁢(x-(j-1/m))nn!,
j-1m≤x<jm,
	

for which it is known that

	
|fj⁢(x)-f~j⁢(x)|≤|f(n+1)⁢(η)|⁢(x-(j-1/m))n+1(n+1)!,
η∈[j-1m,jm),j=1,2,…,m.
	

Since 𝐂jT⁢𝐇j⁢(x) is the best approximation to fj form Yj and f~j∈Yj, using (14) we have

	∥fj-𝐂jT⁢𝐇j⁢(x)∥22	≤∥fj-f~j∥2	
		=∫j-1/mj/m|fj⁢(x)-f~j⁢(x)|2⁢𝑑x	
		≤∫j-1/mj/m[f(n+1)⁢(η)⁢(x-(j-1/m))n+1(n+1)!]2⁢𝑑x	
		≤[γ(n+1)!]2⁢∫j-1/mj/m(x-j-1m)2⁢n+2⁢𝑑x	
		=[γ(n+1)!]2⁢1m2⁢n+3⁢(2⁢n+3).	

Now,

	∥f-𝐂T⁢𝐇⁢(x)∥22	≤∑j=1m∥fj-𝐂jT⁢𝐇j⁢(x)∥22	
		≤γ2m2⁢n+2⁢[(n+1)!]2⁢(2⁢n+3).	

By taking the square roots we have the above bound.

2.4. The Operational Matrix of Product. In this section, we present a general formula for finding the m⁢(n+1)×m⁢(n+1) operational matrix of product 𝐂~ whenever

	
𝐂T⁢𝐇⁢(x)⁢𝐇T⁢(x)≈𝐇T⁢(x)⁢𝐂~,
	

where

	
𝐂~=diag⁡[𝐂~1,𝐂~2,…,𝐂~j,…,𝐂~m].
	

In (18), 𝐂~j=[cl⁢rj] are (n+1)×(n+1) symmetric matrices depending on n, where

	
cl⁢rj=∫j-1/mj/m(hj⁢(l-1)⁢(x)⁢hj⁢(r-1)⁢(x)⁢∑i=0ncj⁢i⁢hj⁢i⁢(x))⁢𝑑x,
l,r=1,2,…,n+1.
	

Furthermore, the integration of cross-product of two hybrid functions vectors is

	
∫01𝐇⁢(x)⁢𝐇T⁢(x)⁢𝑑x=𝐈,
	

where 𝐈 is the m⁢(n+1) identity matrix.

2.5. The Operational Matrix of Differentiation. The operational matrix of derivative of the hybrid functions vector 𝐇⁢(x) is defined by

	
dd⁢x⁢𝐇⁢(x)=𝐃𝐇⁢(x),
	

where 𝐃 is the m⁢(n+1)×m⁢(n+1) operational matrix of derivative given as

	
𝐇⁢(x)=[𝐇1T⁢(x),𝐇2T⁢(x),…,𝐇jT⁢(x),…,𝐇mT⁢(x)]T
	
	
=𝐀~⁢𝐓~⁢(x),
	

where 𝐀~=diag⁡[𝐀1,𝐀2,…,𝐀j,…,𝐀m] is the m(n+1)× m⁢(n+1) coefficient matrix of the (n+1)×(n+1) coefficient submatrix 𝐀j, and 𝐓~⁢(x)=[𝐭1⁢(x),𝐭2⁢(x),…,𝐭j⁢(x),…,𝐭m⁢(x)]T is the m⁢(n+1) vector with 𝐭j⁢(x)=[1,x,x2,…,xn]T, such that 𝐇j⁢(x)=𝐀j⁢𝐭j⁢(x). Now

	
dd⁢x⁢𝐇⁢(x)=𝐀~⁢𝐐~⁢𝐓~⁢(x)=𝐀~⁢𝐐~⁢𝐀~-1⁢𝐇⁢(x),
	

where 𝐐~=diag⁡[𝐐,…,𝐐] is the m⁢(n+1)×m⁢(n+1) matrix of the (n+1)×(n+1) sub-matrix 𝐐, such that

𝐐=[0	0	0	⋯	0	0
1	0	0	⋯	0	0
0	2	0	⋯	0	0
⋮	⋮	⋮	⋯	⋮	⋮
0	0	0	⋯	n	0]. Hence, 𝐃=𝐀~⁢𝐐~⁢𝐀~-1.

In general, we can have

	
dkd⁢xk⁢𝐇⁢(x)=𝐃k⁢𝐇⁢(x),k=1,2,3,….
	
5 Outline of the Solution Method

This section presents the derivation of the method for solving sth-order nonlinear Fredholm integrodifferential equation (1) with the initial conditions (2).

Step 1. The functions y(i)⁢(x),i=0,1,2,…,s are being approximated by

	
y(i)⁢(x)=𝐂T⁢(𝐇⁢(x))(i)=𝐂T⁢𝐃i⁢𝐇⁢(x),i=0,1,2,…,s,
	

where 𝐃 is given by (25).

Step 2. The function k⁢(x,t) is being approximated by (10).

Step 3. In this step, we present a general formula for approximate yq⁢(x). By using (7) and (17), we can have

	y2⁢(x)	=[𝐂T⁢𝐇⁢(x)]2=𝐂T⁢𝐇⁢(x)⁢𝐇T⁢(x)⁢𝐂=𝐇T⁢(x)⁢𝐂~⁢𝐂,	
	y3⁢(x)	=𝐂T⁢𝐇⁢(x)⁢[𝐂T⁢𝐇⁢(x)]2=𝐂T⁢𝐇⁢(x)⁢𝐇T⁢(x)⁢𝐂~⁢𝐂	
		=𝐇T⁢(x)⁢𝐂~⁢𝐂~=𝐇T⁢(x)⁢(𝐂~)2⁢𝐂,	

and so by use of induction, yq⁢(x) will be approximated as

	
yq⁢(x)=𝐇T⁢(x)⁢(𝐂~)q-1⁢𝐂.

1.0	3.7002⁢E-009	8.2709⁢E-007	1.4907⁢E-010

Step 4. Approximate the functions g⁢(x) and pi⁢(x) by

	
g⁢(x)≈𝐆T⁢𝐇⁢(x),
pi⁢(x)≈𝐏iT⁢H⁢(x),i=0,1,2,…,s,
	

where 𝐆 and 𝐏i are constant coefficient vectors which are defined similarly to (7).

Now, using (27)-(32) and (10) to substitute into (1), we can obtain

	∑i=0s	𝐏iT⁢𝐇⁢(x)⁢𝐇T⁢(x)⁢(𝐃i)T⁢𝐂	
		=𝐇T⁢(x)⁢𝐆+λ⁢∫01𝐇T⁢(x)⁢𝐊𝐇⁢(t)⁢𝐇T⁢(t)⁢(𝐂~)q-1⁢𝐂⁢𝑑t.	

Utilizing (17) and (20), we may have

	
∑i=0s𝐇T⁢(x)⁢𝐏~i⁢(𝐃i)T⁢𝐂=𝐇T⁢(x)⁢𝐆+λ⁢𝐇T⁢(x)⁢𝐊⁢(𝐂~)q-1⁢𝐂,
	

and hence we get

	
∑i=0s𝐏~i⁢(𝐃i)T⁢𝐂-λ⁢𝐊⁢(𝐂~)q-1⁢𝐂=𝐆.
	

The matrix (35) gives a system of m⁢(n+1) nonlinear algebraic equations which can be solved utilizing the initial condition for the elements of C. Once C is known, y⁢(x) can be constructed by using (7).

6 Applications and Numerical Results

In this section, numerical results of some examples are presented to validate accuracy, applicability, and convergence of the proposed method. Absolute difference errors of this method is compared with the existing methods reported in the literature [5,6,17,18]. The computations associated with these examples were performed using MATLAB 9.0.

Example 1. Consider the first-order nonlinear Fredholm integrodifferential equation [17,18] as follows:

	
y′⁢(x)=1-13⁢x+∫01x⁢y2⁢(t)⁢𝑑t,0≤x<1,
	

with the initial condition

	
y⁢(0)=0.
	

In this example, we have p0=0,p1=1,g⁢(x)=1-(1/3)⁢x, λ=1,k⁢(x,t)=x, and q=2.

The matrix (35) for this example is

	
𝐏~1⁢𝐃T⁢𝐂-𝐊⁢(𝐂~)⁢𝐂=𝐆,
	

Equation (38) gives a system of nonlinear algebraic equations that can be solved utilizing the initial condition (37); that is, 6⁢c10-2⁢c11=0, we obtain

	
c10=624,	c11=28,
c20=66,	c21=24.
	

Substituting these values into (7), the result will be y⁢(x)=x, that is, the exact solution. It is noted that the result gives the exact solution as in [17], while in [18] using the sinc method the maximum absolute error is 1.52165×10-3. Example 2. Consider the first-order nonlinear Fredholm integrodifferential equation [6,17] as follows:

		x⁢y′⁢(x)-y⁢(x)=-16+45⁢x2+∫01(x2+t)⁢y2⁢(t)⁢𝑑t,	
		0≤x<1.	
		with the initial condition	
		y⁢y⁢(0)=0.	

In this example, we have p0=-1,p1=x,g⁢(x)=-(1/6)+ (4/5)⁢x2,λ=1,k⁢(x,t)=x2+t, and q=2.

The matrix (35) for this example is

	
(𝐏~0+𝐏~1⁢𝐃T)⁢𝐂-𝐊⁢(𝐂~)⁢𝐂=𝐆
	

where for n=2 and m=2 we have

Equation (43) gives a system of nonlinear algebraic equations that can be solved utilizing the initial condition (42); that is, 10⁢c10-6⁢c11+2⁢c12=0, we obtain

	
c10=10240,	c11=648,
c12=	224,c20=1015,
c21=	68,c22=26.
	
	
j=1,2⁢. 
	

Substituting these values into (7), the result will be y⁢(x)=x2, that is, the exact solution. It is noted that the result gives the exact solution as in [17], while in [6] approximate solution is obtained with maximum absolute error 1.0000×10-5.

Example 3. Consider the second-order nonlinear Fredholm integrodifferential equation [17] as follows:

		y′′⁢(x)+x⁢y′⁢(x)-x⁢y⁢(x)=ex⁢sin⁡x+∫01sin⁡x⋅e-2⁢t⁢y2⁢(t)⁢𝑑t,	
		0≤x<1,	
		with the initial conditions	
		y⁢(0)=y′⁢(0)=1.	

The exact solution is y⁢(x)=ex. We solve this example by using the proposed method with n=2,m=30 and n=3, m=30. Comparison among the proposed method and methods in [17] is shown in Table 1. It is clear from this table that the results obtained by the proposed method, using few numbers of basis, are very promising and superior to that of [17].

Example 4. Consider the following nonlinear Fredholm integrodifferential equation [5,17] :

	
y′⁢(x)+y⁢(x)=12⁢(e-2-1)+∫01y2⁢(t)⁢𝑑t,0≤x<1,
	

with the initial conditions

	
y⁢(0)=1.
	

The exact solution of this problem is y⁢(x)=e-x. In Table 2 we have compared the absolute difference errors of the proposed method with the collocation method based on Haar wavelets in [5] and method in [17].

Maximum absolute errors of Example 4 for some different values of n and m are shown in Table 3. As it is seen from Table 3, for a certain value of n as m increases the accuracy increases, and for a certain value of m as n increases the accuracy increases as well. In case of m=1, the numerical solution obtained is based on orthonormal Bernstein polynomials only, while in case of n=0, the numerical solution obtained is based on block-pulse functions only.

7 Conclusion

In this work, we present a numerical method for solving nonlinear Fredholm integrodifferential equations based on hybrid of block-pulse functions and normalized Bernstein polynomials. One of the most important properties of this method is obtaining the analytical solutions if the equation has an exact solution, that is, a polynomial function. Another considerable advantage is this method has high relative accuracy for small numbers of basis n. The matrices 𝐊, 𝐂~, and 𝐃 in (10), (17), and (25), respectively, have large numbers of zero elements, and they are sparse; hence, the present method is very attractive and reduces the CPU time and computer memory. Moreover, satisfactory results of illustrative examples with respect to several other methods (e.g., Haar wavelets method, Walsh functions method, Bernstein polynomials method, and sinc collocation method) are included to demonstrate the validity and applicability of the proposed method.","Journal of Computational and Applied Mathematics 260 (2014) 258-265

utilizing properties of block pulse functions and orthonormal Bernstein polynomials. 2.3. Convergence analysis In this section, the error bound and convergence are established by the following len a. Lemma 2.1. Suppose that f∈C(n+1)⁢[0,1) is an n+1 times continuously differentiaple funce such tho f=∑j=1mfj, and let Yj=Span⁡{hj⁢0⁢(x),hj⁢1⁢(x),…,hj⁢n⁢(x)},j=1,2,…,m. If 𝐂jT⁢𝐇j⁢(x) is the best fproximation om Yj, then 𝐂T⁢𝐇⁢(x) approximates f with the following error bound:

	
∥f-𝐂T⁢𝐇⁢(x)∥2≤γmn+1⁢(n+1)!⁢2⁢n+3,γ=maxx⁣∈⁣[0.1)⁡|f(n+1)⁢(x)|
	

Proof. The Taylor expansion for the function fj⁢(x) is

	
f~j⁢(x)=fj⁢(j-1m)+fj′⁢(j-1m)⁢(x-j-1m)+⋯+fj(n)⁢(j-1m)⁢(x-1-1)nn!,j-1m≤x<jm,
	

for which it is known that

	
|fj(x)-f~j(x)|≤|f(n+1)(η)|(x-j-1m)n+1(n+1)!,η∈[j-1/ i/m),j=1,…,m.
	

Since 𝐂jT⁢𝐇j⁢(x) is the best approximation to fj form Yj a a 𝒢~∈Yj, using …, , , we have ∥fj-𝐂jT𝐇j(x)∥22≤∥fj-f~j∥2=∫j-1/mj/m∣fj(x)-f~j(λd2x ≤∫j-1/mj/m[f(n+1)(η)(γ∼n+1)!=m)n+1 ≤[γ(n+1)!]2⁢∫j-1/m(-1m)2⁢n-2⁢𝑑x=[γ(n+1)!]2⁢1m2⁢n+3⁢(2⁢n+3). Now,

	
∥f-𝐂T⁢𝐇⁢(x)∥22≤∑j=1m∥fj-𝐂jT⁢𝐇j⁢(x)∥2-γ232⁢n+2⁢[(n+1)!]2⁢(2⁢n+3).
	

By taking the square root we hay the above bound. 2.4. The operational mati f⁢t product In this section sent a sormula for finding the m⁢(n+1)×m⁢(n+1) operational matrix of the product 𝐂~ whenever where

	
𝐂~=diag⁡[𝐂~1,𝐂2,𝐂~j,…,𝐂~m].
	

In Eq. (13), 𝐂~j=[cl⁢rj] are (n+1)×(n+1) symmetric matrices depending on n, where

	
cl⁢rj=∫j-1/mj/m(hj⁢(l-1)⁢(x)⁢hj⁢(r-1)⁢(x)⁢∑i=0ncj⁢i⁢hj⁢i⁢(x))⁢𝑑x,l,r=1,2,…,n+1.
	

Furthermore, the integration of the cross-product of two hybrid functions vectors is

	
∫01𝐇⁢(x)⁢𝐇T⁢(x)⁢𝑑x=𝐈,
	

where 𝐈 is the m⁢(n+1) identity matrix.

S.H. Behiry / Journal of Computational and Applied Mathematics 260 (2014) 258-265 261 2.5. The operational matrix of differentiation The operational matrix of the derivative of the hybrid function vector 𝐇⁢(x) is defined by

	
dd⁢x⁢𝐇⁢(x)=𝐃𝐇⁢(x),
	

where 𝐃 is the m⁢(n+1)×m⁢(n+1) operational matrix of the derivative, given as

	
𝐇⁢(x)=[𝐇1T⁢(x),𝐇2T⁢(x),…,𝐇jT⁢(x),…,𝐇mT⁢(x)]T=𝐀~⁢𝐓~⁢(x),
	

where 𝐀~=diag⁡[𝐀1,𝐀2,…,𝐀j,…,𝐀m] is the m⁢(n+1)×m⁢(n+1) coefficient matrix of th +1)×(+1) coefficient submatrix 𝐀j, and 𝐓~⁢(x)=[𝐭1⁢(x),𝐭2⁢(x),…,𝐭j⁢(x),…,𝐭m⁢(x)]T is the m⁢(n+1) vecto with 𝐭j(x)=1,…,xn]T, such that 𝐇j⁢(x)=𝐀j⁢𝐭j⁢(x). Now dd⁢x⁢𝐇⁢(x)=𝐀~⁢𝐐~⁢𝐓~⁢(x)=𝐀~⁢𝐐~⁢𝐀~⁢𝐇-1⁢(x), where 𝐐~=diag⁡[𝐐,𝐐⁢…,𝐐⁢…,𝐐] is the m⁢(n+1)×m⁢(n+1) matrix the (n+1) 1) submatrix 𝐐 such that

	
𝐐=[0	0	0	⋯	0	0
1	0	0	⋯	0	0
0	2	0	⋯	0	0
⋮	⋮	⋮	⋯	⋮	⋮
0	0	0	⋯	n	0].
 Hence, 
𝐃=𝐀~⁢𝐐~⁢𝐀~-1⁢. 
 In general, we obtain 
dkd⁢xk⁢𝐇⁢(x)=𝐃k⁢𝐇⁢(x),k=1,2,3,…
	

3. Outline of the solution method This section presents the derivatio of the thod for solving the sth-order nonlinear Fredholm integro-differential equation (1) with the initial conditio (2). Step 1: The functions y(i)⁢(x),i=0. s are approximated by

	
y(i)(x)=𝐂T(𝐇(x))(i)=𝐜T𝐯′𝐇(x),○1,2,…,s,
	

where 𝐃 is given by (17). Step 2: The function k(x,t s appro imated by (8). Step 3: In this step, we p ent a meral fo hula for approximating yq⁢(x). By using Eqs. (5) and (12), we obtain y2⁢(x)=[𝐂T⁢𝐇⁢(x)]2=(x)⁢𝐇T 𝐂=𝐇T⁢(x)⁢𝐂~⁢𝐂, and so by use mductio y4(x, ill be approximated as

	
yq⁢(x)=𝐇⁢𝐂1-1.
	

Step 4: Approximate tho nctions g⁢(x) and pi⁢(x) by

	
g⁢(x)≈𝐆T⁢𝐇⁢(x),
	

and

	
pi⁢(x)≈𝐏iT⁢H⁢(x),i=0,1,2,…,s,
	

where 𝐆 and 𝐏i are constant coefficient vectors which are defined similarly to Eq. (5). Now, using Eqs. (19)-(22) and (8) to substitute into Eq. (1), we obtain

	
∑i=0s𝐏iT⁢𝐇⁢(x)⁢𝐇T⁢(x)⁢(𝐃i)T⁢𝐂=𝐇T⁢(x)⁢𝐆+λ⁢∫01𝐇T⁢(x)⁢𝐊𝐇⁢(t)⁢𝐇T⁢(t)⁢(𝐂~)q-1⁢𝐂⁢𝑑t.
	




262 S.H. Behiry / Journal of Computational and Applied Mathematics 260 (2014) 258-265 Utilizing Eqs. (12) and (15), we obtain

	
∑i=0s𝐇T⁢(x)⁢𝐏~i⁢(𝐃i)T⁢𝐂=𝐇T⁢(x)⁢𝐆+λ⁢𝐇T⁢(x)⁢𝐊⁢(𝐂~)q-1⁢𝐂
	

and hence we get

	
∑i=0s𝐏~i⁢(𝐃i)T⁢𝐂-λ⁢𝐊⁢(𝐂~)q-1⁢𝐂=𝐆
	

The matrix equation (25) gives a system of m⁢(n+1) nonlinear algebraic equations whic η be solved y lizing the initial condition for the elements of 𝐂. Once 𝐂 is known, y⁢(x) can be constructed by using Ef (5). 4. Applications and numerical results of the proposed method. The absolute difference errors of this method are ompar with th of the existing methods Example 1. Consider the first-order nonlinear Fredholm integro-diffe ntic ruation [17,18]

	
y′⁢(x)=1-13⁢x+∫01x⁢y2⁢(t)⁢𝑑t,0≤x<1
	

with the initial condition

	
y⁢(0)=0⁢. 
	

In this example, we have p0=0,p1=1,g(x)=1-13x,λ=1,kt)=x  dq=2. The matrix equation (25) for this example is

	
𝐏~1⁢𝐃T⁢𝐂-𝐊⁢(𝐂~)⁢𝐂=𝐆,
	

where, for n=1 and m=2, we have

	
𝐊=[1/16	3/48	6	3/48
3/16	1/16	3/1	1/16
1/4	3/12	1/4	3/12
3/8	1/8	3/8	1/0]
	

2⁢c11=0. Y obtain c10=6/c11=2/8,c20=6/6, and c21=2/4 Substituting these res into (5), the result will be y⁢(x)=x, which is the exact solution. It is noted that the result gives the exact solution as in [1..1., while in [18] using the sinc method the maximum absolute error is 1.5217⁢E-03. Example 2. Consider the first-order nonlinear Fredholm integro-differential equation [6,17]

	
x⁢y′⁢(x)-y⁢(x)=-16+45⁢x2+∫01(x2+t)⁢y2⁢(t)⁢𝑑t,0≤x<1
	

with the initial condition

	
y⁢(0)=0⁢. 
	

In this example, we have p0=-1,p1=x,g⁢(x)=-16+45⁢x2,λ=1,k⁢(x,t)=x2+t, and q=2.

S.H. Behiry / Journal of Computational and Applied Mathematics 260 (2014) 258-265 263 The matrix equation (25) for this example is

	
(𝐏~0+𝐏~1⁢𝐃T)⁢𝐂-𝐊⁢(𝐂~)⁢𝐂=𝐆,
	

where for n=2 and m=2 we have

	
𝐏~0=-𝐈,𝐏~1=[1/12	15/60	-5/120	0	0	0	
15/60	1/4	3/24	0	0	0	
-5/120	3/24	5/12	0	0		
0	0	0	7/12	15/60	-5/120	
0	0	0	15/60	3/4		
0	0	0	-5/120	3/24	11/12	
	

Eq. (31) gives a system on hin algebr 2quations that can be solved utilizing the initial condition (30); i.e., 10⁢c10- 6⁢c11+2⁢c12=0. We obli c10=10 40,c11= c12=2/24,c20=10/15,c21=6/8, and c22=2/6. Substituting nese val (5), the result will be y⁢(x)=x2, which is the exact solution. It is noted that the result gives the exact solu as in ,77], whic in [6] approximate solution is obtained with maximum absolute error 1.0000E-10. Example 3. Conside second order nonlinear Fredholm integro-differential equation [17]

	
y′′⁢(x)+x⁢y′⁢(x)-x⁢y⁢(x)=ex-sin⁡x+∫01sin⁡x⋅e-2⁢t⁢y2⁢(t)⁢𝑑t,0≤x<1,
	

with the initial conditions

	
y⁢(0)=y′⁢(0)=1.
	

The exact solution is y⁢(x)=ex. We solve this example by using the proposed method with n=2 and m=30 and with n=3 and m=30. A comparison between the proposed method and the methods in [17] is shown in Table 1. It is clear from this table that the results obtained by the proposed method, using a small number of bases, are very promising and superior to those of [17].

y′(x)+y(x)=12(e-2-1+∫02(t)dt,0≤x<1
	

Table 3 with the initial condition

	
y⁢(0)=1
	

The exact solution of th roble is y⁢(x)⁢e-x. In Table 2 we have compared the absolute difference errors of the proposed method with those of the a ation m hod based on Haar wavelets in [5] and the method in [17].

The maximum Table 3, for a ce in valu infin as m increases, the accuracy increases, and for a certain value of m, as n increases, the accuracy increases as y 1 . Whep l= numerical solution obtained is based on orthonormal Bernstein polynomials only, while when n=0 the cal solution obtained is based on block pulse functions only. Example 5. Conside - first-order nonlinear Fredholm integro-differential equation [17,18]

	
y′⁢(x)=ex-15⁢e-x2⁢(e5-1)+∫01e2⁢t-x2⁢y3⁢(t)⁢𝑑t,0≤x<1,
	

with the initial condition

	
y⁢(0)=1.
	

The absolute difference errors of the proposed method for n=4 and m=35 and for n=5 and m=20,35, and the absolute difference errors of the method in [17] are displayed in Table 4. The results obtained by the proposed method using four basis functions are better than those of [17] using nine basis functions. Of course, as n increases, the accuracy improves. Also, the maximum absolute error in [18] using the sinc method is 3.7259E-03. The exact solution of this problem is y⁢(x)=e-x.

"We study several joint facility location and inventory management problems with stochastic retailer demand. In particular, we consider cases with uncapacitated facilities, capacitated facilities, correlated retailer demand, stochastic lead times, and multicommodities. We show how to formulate these problems as conic quadratic mixed-integer problems. Valid inequalities, including extended polymatroid and extended cover cuts, are added to strengthen the formulations and improve the computational results. Compared to the existing modeling and solution methods, the new conic integer programming approach not only provides a more general modeling framework but also leads to fast solution times in general.","In this paper, we design a combined location-inventory model for deteriorating products under capacitated facilities, stochastic lead time, multiple products, and correlated retailers’ stochastic demands assumptions.

	min	∑j∈J(fj⁢xj+∑i∈Id^i⁢j⁢yi⁢j+Kj⁢t1⁢j+qj⁢t2⁢j),	
	s.t.	∑i∈Iμi⁢yi⁢j2⩽t1⁢j2,j∈J,	
		∑i∈Iσi2⁢yi⁢j2⩽t2⁢j2,j∈J,	
		t1⁢j,t2⁢j⩾0,j∈J,	
		(CQMIP1) s.t. ⁢∑i∈Iμi⁢yi⁢j2⩽t1⁢j2,j∈J⁢,	

(1)-(3).

Note that the objective of (CQMIP1) is linear and the constraints are either conic quadratic or linear, which fits into the general conic quadratic mixed-integer programming model described in §⁢3.","By introducing auxiliary variables tj⁢l,zj⁢l for each j and l,tj⁢l is defined by constraint (14), and zj⁢l is defined by constraint (15). Now we, based on the above formulation, give conic quadratic mixed-integer programming model (CQMIP):

	
min⁢∑j∈J(fj⁢xj+∑l∈L(∑i∈Id^i⁢j⁢l⁢yi⁢j⁢l+θ⁢hl⁢zj⁢l2+q^j⁢l⁢tj⁢l+∑i∈INi⁢0⁢(1-e-λl⁢(tj+ti⁢l⁢yi⁢j⁢l+Lj⁢l))⁢(Fi+Di))),
	
		s.t. ⁢∑l∈L(Lj⁢l⁢∑i∈Iμi⁢l⁢yi⁢j⁢l+Qj⁢l+tj⁢l)≤Cj⁢xj,j∈J,	
		(tj+Lj⁢l+yi⁢j⁢l⁢ti⁢j)≤tl,i∈I,j∈J,l∈L,

where Hj⁢l=F^j⁢l/(θ⁢hl/2)

"13.1 Extended Cover Cuts

To strengthen formulation (CQMIP2) we add cover type inequalities derived from nonlinear knapsack relaxations of the formulation. Toward this end, consider the capacity constraints (9). For each j, we relax the left-hand side of the constraint by dropping Qj. Furthermore, we substitute tj with the left-hand side of constraint (10) to arrive at the nonlinear 0-1 knapsack constraint

zα⁢Lj⁢∑i∈Iσi2⁢yi⁢j+Lj⁢∑i∈Iμi⁢yi⁢j⩽Cj

For simplicity of notation, we drop the subscript j to define the inequalities. For inequality (13), define the set function f:2I→ℝ, where

f⁢(S)=zα⁢L⁢σ2⁢(S)+L⁢μ⁢(S) σ2⁢(S):=∑i∈Sσi2 and μ⁢(S):=∑i∈Sμi. Using submodularity of f, Atamtürk and Narayanan (2009) give cover and extended cover cuts for the submodular knapsack set,

	Y	={y∈{0,1}|I|:f⁢(y)⩽C}	
		={y∈{0,1}|I|:zα⁢L⁢∑i∈Iσi2⁢yi+L⁢∑i∈Iμi⁢yi⩽C}.	

They show that given a subset of indices S⊆I and the conic quadratic 0-1 knapsack set Y, we can find valid cover inequalities that depend on the cover set.

Definition 3. S⊆I is called a cover for Y if zα⁢L⁢σ2⁢(S)+L⁢μ⁢(S)>C.

Atamtürk and Narayanan (2009) show that for cover S the corresponding cover inequality

∑i∈Syi⩽|S|-1

is valid for Y.","4.3. Extended Cover Cuts. We use optimization software CPLEX to solve CQMIP problem. In order to get a better solution we strengthen the formulations (CQMIP) with cover inequalities, utilize the left side of inequality (14) to substitute tj⁢l, and then we receive the nonlinear 0-1 constraint knapsack result:

	
∑l∈L(y.jl′⁢(Lj⁢l⁢Vl+σLj⁢l2⁢Ml)⁢y.jl+Lj⁢l⁢∑i∈Iμi⁢l⁢yi⁢j⁢l)≤cj.
	

For inequality (17), define a set function f⁢(s) that is from set 2I to set R :

	
f⁢(s)=∑l∈L(y.jl′⁢(Lj⁢l⁢Vl+σLj⁢l2⁢Ml)⁢y.jl+Lj⁢l⁢μ⁢(s)).
	

Using submodularity of set function f⁢(s), we can gain the extended cover cuts for the submodular knapsack set Y :

	Y	={y∈{0,1}|I|:f(y)≤c}={y∈{0,1}|I|:	
		∑l∈L(y.jl′⁢(Lj⁢l⁢Vl+σLj⁢l2⁢Ml)⁢y.jl+Lj⁢l⁢∑i∈Iμi⁢l⁢yi⁢j⁢l)	
		≤c}.	

Because the validity of the cover inequality depends on not only the submodular knapsack set Y but also the cover set, define a cover set as follow: S⊆I, which is called a cover set for Y if ∑l∈L(y.jl′⁢(Lj⁢l⁢Vl+σLj⁢l2⁢Ml)⁢y.jl+Lj⁢l⁢μ⁢(s))>c⁢x.

Narayanan [27] shows that for cover set S, cover inequality ∑i∈Syi≤|s|-1 is valid for Y. We will utilize this cover inequality in our computations.",1248.90057.tex,1427.90033.tex,Insertions; Math-to-Text; Paraphrase; Variation of subject; Deletions; Different Presentation

Based on Figure 4, in order to explain lead time variability, we add a third axis.

"1 Introduction

Let q≥3 be a positive integer. For any integers m and n, the two-term exponential sum C⁢(m,n,k;q) is defined as follows:

	
C⁢(m,n,k;q)=∑a=1qe⁢(m⁢ak+n⁢aq)
	

where e⁢(y)=e2⁢π⁢i⁢y.

Regarding the various properties of C⁢(m,n,k;q), some authors have studied them, and obtained a series of results. Some related works can be found in references [1-8]. For example, Gauss’ classical work proved the remarkable formula (see [1])

where i2=-1.

Generally, for any odd number q and (m,q)=1, the exact value of |C⁢(m,0,2;q)| is q, More relevant to it, Cochrane and Zheng [4] showed the general sum that

	
|C⁢(m,n,k;q)|≤kω⁢(q)⁢q1/2
	

where ω⁢(q) denotes the number of all distinct prime divisors of q. In this paper, we study the fourth power mean of the twoterm exponential sum C⁢(m,n,k;q) as follows:

The problem is interesting, because it can reflect that the mean value of C⁢(m,n,k;q) is well behaved.","1 Introduction Let q≥3 be a positive integer.

"2 Introduction

In this paper, we point out an error in the algorithm proposed in [5] for finding all hinge vertices of a permutation graph. We also modify the algorithm to correct it.

Let G=(V,E) be an undirected simple graph. We define the distance dG⁢(x,y) as the length of the shortest path between vertices x and y in G. Then, u∈V is a hinge vertex if there exist two vertices x,y∈V-{u} such that dG-u⁢(x,y)>dG⁢(x,y). For simplicity, we say, throughout this paper, that u is a hinge vertex of x and y. The hinge vertex problem is to find all hinge vertices in G. Finding the set of all hinge vertices in a graph is useful for identifying critical nodes in an actual network. In recent years, many studies have focused on the hinge vertex problem [1-6].

E-mail address: honma@info.kushiro-ct.ac.jp (H. Honma). Let V={1,2,…,n} and P=[p1,p2,…,pn] be a permutation on V. A graph G=(V,E) is a permutation graph if and only if there exists a permutation P on V such that (i-j)⁢(pi-1-pj-1)<0 for (i,j)∈E, where pi-1 denotes the position of i in P [7]. We denote P-1= [p1-1,p2-1,…,pn-1]. A permutation graph is also visualized by its corresponding permutation model. The permutation model consists of two horizontal parallel lines, called the upper and lower, respectively. We put the vertices 1,2,…,n on the upper, in the order from left to right, and put p1,p2,…,pn on the lower in the same way. Next, for each i∈V, draw a straight line from i on the upper to i on the lower. Then, there is an edge (i,j) in G if and only if lines i and j intersect. We use the words ""line"" and ""vertex"" interchangeably in this paper. An example of a permutation model M and its corresponding permutation graph G is shown in Fig. 1. Table 1 is the details of P and P-1 for model M shown in Fig. 1(a). In this example, vertex 8 of G is a hinge vertex of vertices 3 and 4 .

Ho et al. presented a linear time algorithm for finding all hinge vertices of a permutation graph [5]. However, there is a case which is not considered in [5]. This results

in their algorithm incorrect when this case occurs. In Section 2, we introduce the case in detail and explain the reason why all hinge vertices cannot be found by their algorithm. In Section 3, we propose an efficient way for solving the case so that all hinge vertices of a permutation graph G can be found in O⁢(n) time.

3 A counterexample

For ease of understanding, we use the same notation introduced in [5]. Let G=(V,E) be a permutation graph with corresponding permutation model M. Let i be a vertex of G. The neighborhood of i is the set of all vertices adjacent to i and is denoted by N⁢(i). The closed neighborhood of i is N⁢[i]=N⁢(u)∪{i}. For all i∈V, the following functions are defined. UR(i)=max{j∣j∈N[i]},SUR(i)= max⁡{j∣j∈(N⁢[i]\U⁢R⁢(i))∪{i}},U⁢L⁢(i)=min⁡{j∣j∈N⁢[i]}, and SUL⁡(i)=max⁡{j∣j∈(N⁢[i]\U⁢L⁢(i))∪{i}}.L⁢R⁢(i)=k if and only if pk-1=max⁡{pi-1,max⁡{pj-1∣(i,j)∈E}}.L⁢L⁢(i)=k if and only if pk-1=min⁡{pi-1,min⁡{pj-1∣(i,j)∈E}}. Finally, Dr⁢(i)={k∣SUR⁡(i)<k<U⁢R⁢(i)} and Dl(i)={k∣UL(i)<k< SUL(i)}

Table 2 shows the results of U⁢R,S⁢U⁢R,Dr, and L⁢R applied to the example in Fig. 1.

The following lemma gives a necessary and sufficient condition of hinge vertices in permutation graphs.

Lemma 1. (See Lemma 5 in [5].) Let u be a vertex of a permutation graph G=(V,E). Vertex u is a hinge vertex of G if and only if there exist two vertices x,y⁢(x<y)∈V such that one of the following conditions holds: (1) u=U⁢R⁢(x),y∈Dr⁢(x) and pL⁢R⁢(x)-1<py-1,

(2) u=U⁢L⁢(y),x∈Dl⁢(y) and px-1<pL⁢L⁢(y)-1.

By applying straightforwardly Lemma 1 , the hinge vertex problem on permutation graph can be solved in O⁢(n2) time. Lemmas 2 and 3 are used to reduce the timecomplexity.

Lemma 2. (See Lemma 7 in [5].) Let G=(V,E) be a permutation graph with vertices u,x1,x2,y∈V. Assume that x1< x2,U⁢R⁢(x1)=U⁢R⁢(x2)=u, and y∈Dr⁢(x1). If dG-u⁢(x2,y)> dG⁢(x2,y), then dG-u⁢(x1,y)>dG⁢(x1,y).

Lemma 3. (See Lemma 8 in [5].) Let G=(V,E) be a permutation graph with vertices u,y1,y2,x∈V. Assume that y1< y2,U⁢L⁢(y1)=U⁢L⁢(y2)=u, and x∈Dl⁢(y2). If dG-u⁢(x,y1)> dG⁢(x,y1), then dG-u⁢(x,y2)>dG⁢(x,y2).

Condition (2) of Lemma 1 is symmetric to its condition (1). Similarly, Lemma 3 is symmetric to Lemma 2. Hence, we need, hereafter, only refer to condition (1) of Lemmas 1 and 2. Now, suppose that x1 is the smallest vertex in the set of vertices satisfying u=U⁢R⁢(x1)=U⁢R⁢(x2)= ⋯=U⁢R⁢(xs) and x1<x2<⋯<xs. Ho et al. insisted that we only need to check whether there exists a vertex y∈Dr⁢(x1) such that pL⁢R⁢(x1)-1<py-1 in [5]. If there exists such a y, then vertex u is a hinge vertex by Lemma 2 . Moreover, they stated that all hinge vertices can be found in O⁢(n) time by applying Lemmas 2 and 3 . However, they oversimplified the meaning of Lemma 2 and only use x1 and the vertices in Dr⁢(x1) to determine whether u is a hinge vertex. This results in their algorithm incorrect.

See the example shown in Fig. 1 and Table 2. We can find that U⁢R⁢(1)=U⁢R⁢(2)=⋯=U⁢R⁢(8)=8. Let S= {1,2,…,8}. Since vertex 1 is the smallest vertex in S and Dr⁢(1)=∅, vertex 8 cannot be detected as a hinge vertex after applying their algorithm. However, in fact, vertex 8 is a hinge vertex of vertices 3 and 4 . This implies that some step in [5] is not correct.

We explain the reason why some hinge vertices cannot be correctly found by using their algorithm. Let S= {x1,x2,…,xs} be the set containing all vertices having U⁢R⁢(xi)=u in which x1 is the smallest vertex among the vertices in S. If all Dr⁢(xi) for i=1,2,…,s are a subset of Dr⁢(x1), then their algorithm will work correctly. However, if there exists a Dr⁢(xi) with i≠1 which is not a subset

Fig. 2. u is a hinge vertex of x2 and y.

of Dr⁢(x1), then u might not be detected as a hinge vertex by using their algorithm. For example, see Fig. 2. We can find that Dr⁢(x1)⊂Dr⁢(x2). If Dr⁢(x1)=∅ or every vertex in Dr⁢(x1) intersects L⁢R⁢(x1), then u cannot be detected as a hinge vertex by only checking the vertices in Dr⁢(x1). In this example, we can find that u is a hinge vertex of x2 and y. Note that y∈Dr⁢(x2)\Dr⁢(x1). This reveals that we have to check the vertices in Dr⁢(x2)\Dr⁢(x1) to determine whether u is a hinge vertex. Accordingly, if x1<x2< ⋯<xs and Dr⁢(x1)⊆Dr⁢(x2)⊆⋯⊆Dr⁢(xs), then we have to find the sets Dr(x2)\Dr(x1),Dr(x3)\Dr(x2),…,Dr(xs)\ Dr⁢(xs-1) in linear time so that the hinge vertex problem in permutation graphs can be solved in linear time.

4 An O⁢(n)-time algorithm for finding all hinge vertices

We first define that A⁢U⁢R=⋃i=1n{U⁢R⁢(i)} and A⁢U⁢L= ⋃i=1n{U⁢L⁢(i)}. For each u∈A⁢U⁢R, let l⁢(u) (respectively, r⁢(u) ) stand for the smallest (respectively, largest) index i of pi with U⁢R⁢(pi)=u.

Similarly, for each u∈A⁢U⁢L, let l′⁢(u) (respectively, r′⁢(u) ) stand for the smallest (respectively, largest) index i of pi with U⁢L⁢(pi)=u. Lemma 4 (respectively, Lemma 5) describes the inclusion relation of Dr⁢(py) and Dr⁢(px) (respectively, Dl⁢(px) and Dl(py)) for two vertices px and py having U⁢R⁢(px)=U⁢R⁢(py) (respectively, U⁢L⁢(px)=U⁢L⁢(py) ).

Lemma 4. For each u∈A⁢U⁢R, if there exist two integers x and y such that l⁢(u)+1⩽x<y⩽r⁢(u), then Dr⁢(py)⊆Dr⁢(px).

Proof. Since UR⁡(px)=U⁢R⁢(py)=u, if we can prove that SUR⁡(px)⩽SUR⁡(py), then the lemma follows. First, we consider the case px<py. In this case, the possible value of SUR⁡(px) can be either px⩽SUR⁡(px)<py or py<SUR⁡(px)<u. By definition, SUR⁡(py)⩾py. If px⩽ SUR⁡(px)<py, then SUR⁡(px)<py⩽SUR⁡(py). Moreover,

(a) Case of px<py if py<SUR⁡(px)<u, then SUR⁡(px)⩽SUR⁡(py)<u. Therefore, the lemma holds for this case (see Fig. 3(a)). For the case where py<px, both SUR⁡(px) and SUR⁡(py) are greater than or equal to px. Furthermore, SUR⁡(px) must intersect py. Therefore, SUR⁡(px)⩽SUR⁡(py) (see Fig. 3(b)). This completes the proof.

Lemma 5. For each u∈A⁢U⁢L, if there exist two integers x and y such that l′⁢(u)⩽x<y⩽r′⁢(u)-1, then Dl⁢(px)⊆Dl⁢(py).

Proof. By using a similar argument as in Lemma 4, this lemma follows.

For each u∈A⁢U⁢R and l⁢(u)⩽x⩽r⁢(u), let c⁢(px)= min⁡{pl⁢(u),pl⁢(u)+1,…,px} and Cr⁢(u)=⋃i=l⁢(u)+1r⁢(u){c⁢(pi)}. If Cr⁢(u) is not an empty set, then we may assume without loss of generality that Cr(u)={m1(u),m2(u),…, m|Cr⁢(u)|(u)} and mi⁢(u)<mi+1⁢(u) for 1⩽i⩽|Cr⁢(u)|- 1. When context is clear, we simply write mi rather than mi⁢(u). For example, see Fig. 1. In Fig. 1,P= [8,3,5,2,6,7,1,4] with u=8. Thus, U⁢R⁢(1)=U⁢R⁢(2)= ⋯=U⁢R⁢(8)=8,l⁢(u)=1, and r⁢(u)=8. Accordingly, c⁢(8)= 8,c⁢(3)=c⁢(5)=3,c⁢(2)=c⁢(6)=c⁢(7)=2,c⁢(1)=c⁢(4)=1, and Cr⁢(u)={1,2,3} in which m1=1,m2=2, and m3=3.

Similarly, we can define c′⁢(px) and Cl⁢(u) for each u∈A⁢U⁢L as follows. For each u∈A⁢U⁢L and l′⁢(u)⩽x⩽ r′⁢(u), let c′⁢(px)=max⁡{px,px+1,…,pr′⁢(u)} and Cl⁢(u)= ⋃i=l′⁢(u)r′⁢(u)-1{c′⁢(pi)}. If Cl⁢(u) is not an empty set, then we may assume without loss of generality that Cl⁢(u)= {m1′⁢(u),m2′⁢(u),…,m|Cl⁢(u)|′⁢(u)} and mi′⁢(u)>mi+1′⁢(u) for 1⩽i⩽|Cl⁢(u)|-1. When context is clear, we simply write mi′ rather than mi′⁢(u)

Lemma 6. Assume that U⁢R⁢(x)=u and y∈Dr⁢(x). If u is a hinge vertex of vertices x and y, then u is a hinge vertex of c⁢(x) and y.

Proof. Since c⁢(x)⩽x, by Lemma 4,Dr⁢(x)⊆Dr⁢(c⁢(x)). If y∈Dr⁢(x), then y∈Dr⁢(c⁢(x)). By Lemma 2 , this lemma holds.

Lemma 7. Assume that U⁢L⁢(x)=u and y∈Dl⁢(x). If u is a hinge vertex of vertices x and y, then u is a hinge vertex of c′⁢(x) and y.

Proof. Since c′⁢(x)⩾x, by Lemma 5,Dl⁢(x)⊆Dl⁢(c′⁢(x)). If y∈Dl⁢(x), then y∈Dl⁢(c′⁢(x)). By Lemma 3 , this lemma holds.

(b) Case of py<px

Fig. 3. Illustration of Lemma 4.

Fig. 4. An illustration of Dr′.

By Lemma 6 (respectively, Lemma 7), we only need to check the vertices in Dr⁢(mi) (respectively, Dl⁢(mi′) ) to determine whether U⁢R⁢(mi) (respectively, U⁢L⁢(mi′) ) is a hinge vertex or not. Note that c⁢(px) can also be expressed recursively as

c⁢(px)={min⁡{px,c⁢(px-1)}	 if ⁢x>l⁢(u),
px	 if ⁢x=l⁢(u),

for UR⁡(px)=u, and c′⁢(px) can be expressed as

c′⁢(px)={max⁡{px,c′⁢(px+1)}	 if ⁢x<r⁢(v),
px	 if ⁢x=r⁢(u),

for U⁢L⁢(px)=v. Finding Cr⁢(u) (respectively, Cl⁢(u) ) for all u∈A⁢U⁢R (respectively, u∈AUL) can be done in O⁢(n) time.

By Lemma 4,Dr⁢(mi⁢(u))⊆Dr⁢(mj⁢(u)) for i<j and u∈A⁢U⁢R. To avoid checking the vertices in Dr⁢(mi)∩Dr⁢(mj), for i≠j, repeatedly, denote by Dr′⁢(mi)=Dr⁢(mi)\Dr⁢(mi-1) for i=1,2,…,|Cr⁢(u)| with m0=u and Dl′(mi′)=Dl(mi′)\ Dl⁢(mi-1′) for i=1,2,…,|Cl⁢(u)| with m0′=u (see Fig. 4 for an illustration of Dr′ ). Consequently, by Lemma 2 , we only need to check the vertices, say x, in Dr′⁢(mi) to determine whether u is a hinge vertex of mi and x. Note that the vertices in Dr′⁢(mi) are consecutive on the upper and can be represented by (SUR⁡(mi),S⁢U⁢R⁢(mi-1)+1), i=2,3,…,|Cr⁢(u)|, namely, Dr′(mi)={x∣SUR(mi)<x< SUR(mi-1)+1},i=2,3,…,|Cr(u)|, and Dr′(m1)={x∣ SUR(m1)<x<UR(m1)}. Analogously, Dl′(mi′)={x∣ SUL(mi-1′-1)<x<SUL(mi′)},i=2,3,…,|Cl(u)|, and Dl′⁢(m1′)={x∣U⁢L⁢(m1′)<x<SUL⁡(m1′)}. Therefore, it can be done in O⁢(n) time to check whether u is a hinge vertex for all vertices u∈A⁢U⁢R∪A⁢U⁢L. For example, see Fig. 1. Cr⁢(u)= {1,2,3} in which m1=1,m2=2, and m3=3. Accordingly, Dr⁢(m1)=∅,Dr⁢(m2)={6,7}, and Dr⁢(m3)={4,5,6,7}. This yields Dr′⁢(m1)=∅,Dr′⁢(m2)={6,7}, and Dr′⁢(m3)={4,5}.

Finally, we are at a position to describe how to modify the algorithm proposed in [5] so that all hinge vertices can be found in O⁢(n) time. We only need to modify Steps 5 and 6 of the algorithm proposed in [5] as follows:

Step 5. Find the sets A⁢U⁢R and Cr⁢(u) for u∈A⁢U⁢R. Based on Condition (1) of Theorem 5 in [5], use the vertices in Dr′⁢(mi⁢(u)), for i=1,2,…,|Cr⁢(u)|, to determine whether u is a hinge vertex or not.

Step 6. Find the sets A⁢U⁢L and Cl⁢(u) for u∈A⁢U⁢L. Based on Condition (2) of Theorem 5 in [5], use the ver-

tices in Dl′⁢(mi′⁢(u)), for i=1,2,…,|Cl⁢(u)|, to determine whether u is a hinge vertex or not.","1 Introduction

In this paper, we point out an error in the algorithm proposed in [5] for finding all hinge vertices of a permutation graph. We also modify the algorithm to correct it.

Let G=(V,E) be an undirected simple graph. We define the distance dG⁢(x,y) as the length of the shortest path between vertices x and y in G. Then, u∈V is a hinge vertex if there exist two vertices x,y∈V-{u} such that dG-u⁢(x,y)>dG⁢(x,y). For simplicity, we say, throughout this paper, that u is a hinge vertex of x and y. The hinge vertex problem is to find all hinge vertices in G. Finding the set of all hinge vertices in a graph is useful for identifying critical nodes in an actual network. In recent years, many studies have focused on the hinge vertex problem [1,2,3,4,5,6].

Let V={1,2,…,n} and P=[p1,p2,…,pn] be a permutation on V. A graph G=(V,E) is a permutation graph if and only if there exists a permutation P on V such that (i-j)⁢(pi-1-pj-1)<0 for (i,j)∈E, where pi-1 denotes the position of i in P⁢[7]. We denote P-1=[p1-1,p2-1,…,pn-1]. A permutation graph is also visualized by its corresponding permutation model. The permutation model consists of two horizontal parallel lines, called the upper and lower, respectively. We put the vertices 1,2,…,n on the upper, in the order from left to right, and put p1,p2,…,pn on the lower in the same way. Next, for each i∈V, draw a straight line from i on the upper to i on the lower. Then, there is an edge (i,j) in G if and only if lines i and j intersect. We use the words ""line"" and ""vertex"" interchangeably in this paper. An example of a permutation model M and its corresponding permutation graph G is shown in Figure 1 . Table 1 is the details of P and P-1 for model M shown in Figure 1(a). In this example, vertex 8 of G is a hinge vertex of vertices 3 and 4.

For ease of understanding, we use the same notation introduced in [5]. Let G=(V,E) be a permutation graph with corresponding permutation model M. Let i be a vertex of G. The neighborhood of i is the set of all vertices adjacent to i and is denoted by N⁢(i). The closed neighborhood of i is N⁢[i]=N⁢(u)∪{i}. For all i∈V, the following functions are defined. UR(i)=max{j∣j∈N[i]},SUR(i)=max{j∣j∈ (N[i]\UR(i))∪{i}},UL(i)=min{j∣j∈N[i]}, and S⁢U⁢L⁢(i)=max⁡{j∣j∈(N⁢[i]\U⁢L⁢(i))∪{i}}.L⁢R⁢(i)=k if and only if pk-1=max⁡{pi-1,max⁡{pj-1∣(i,j)∈E}}. L⁢L⁢(i)=k if and only if pk-1=min{pi-1,min{pj-1 (i,j)∈E}}. Finally, Dr(i)={k∣SUR(i)<k< UR(i)} and Dl⁢(i)={k∣U⁢L⁢(i)<k<S⁢U⁢L⁢(i)}.

Table 2 shows the results of U⁢R,S⁢U⁢R,Dr, and L⁢R applied to the example in Figure 1.

The following lemma gives a necessary and sufficient condition of hinge vertices in permutation graphs.

Lemma 1 (Lemma 5 in [5]) Let u be a vertex of a permutation graph G=(V,E). Vertex u is a hinge vertex of G if and only if there exist two vertices

(a) M

(b) G

x,y⁢(x<y)∈V such that one of the following conditions holds:

(1) u=U⁢R⁢(x),y∈Dr⁢(x) and pL⁢R⁢(x)-1<py-1

(2) u=U⁢L⁢(y),x∈Dl⁢(y) and px-1<pL⁢L⁢(y)-1.

By applying straightforwardly Lemma 1, the hinge vertex problem on permutation graph can be solved in O⁢(n2) time. Lemmas 2 and 3 are used to reduce the time-complexity.

Lemma 2 (Lemma 7 in [5]) Let G=(V,E) be a permutation graph with vertices u,x1,x2,y∈V. Assume that x1<x2,U⁢R⁢(x1)=U⁢R⁢(x2)=u, and y∈Dr⁢(x1). If dG-u⁢(x2,y)>dG⁢(x2,y), then dG-u⁢(x1,y)>dG⁢(x1,y).

Lemma 3 (Lemma 8 in [5]) Let G=(V,E) be a permutation graph with vertices u,y1,y2,x∈V. Assume that y1<y2,U⁢L⁢(y1)=U⁢L⁢(y2)=u, and x∈Dl⁢(y2). If dG-u⁢(x,y1)>dG⁢(x,y1), then dG-u⁢(x,y2)>dG⁢(x,y2)

Condition (2) of Lemma 1 is symmetric to its condition (1). Similarly, Lemma 3 is symmetric to Lemma 2. Hence, we need, hereafter, only refer to condition (1) of Lemmas 1 and 2. Now, suppose that x1 is the smallest vertex in the set of vertices satisfying u=U⁢R⁢(x1)=U⁢R⁢(x2)=⋯=U⁢R⁢(xs) and x1<x2<⋯<xs. Ho et al. insisted that we only need to check whether there exists a vertex y∈Dr⁢(x1) such that pL⁢R⁢(x1)-1<py-1 in [5]. If there exists such a y, then vertex u is a hinge vertex by Lemma 2. Moreover, they stated that all hinge vertices can be found in O⁢(n) time by applying Lemmas 2 and 3. However, they oversimplified the meaning of Lemma 2 and only use x1 and the vertices in Dr⁢(x1) to determine whether u is a hinge vertex. This results in their algorithm incorrect.

See the example shown in Figure 1 and Table 2. We can find that U⁢R⁢(1)=U⁢R⁢(2)=⋯=U⁢R⁢(8)=8. Let S={1,2,…,8}. Since vertex 1 is the smallest vertex in S and Dr⁢(1)=∅, vertex 8 cannot be

Figure 2: u is a hinge vertex of x2 and y.

detected as a hinge vertex after applying their algorithm. However, in fact, vertex 8 is a hinge vertex of vertices 3 and 4 . This implies that some step in [5] is not correct.

We explain the reason why some hinge vertices cannot be correctly found by using their algorithm. Let S={x1,x2,…,xs} be the set containing all vertices having U⁢R⁢(xi)=u in which x1 is the smallest vertex among the vertices in S. If all Dr⁢(xi) for i=1,2,…,s are a subset of Dr⁢(x1), then their algorithm will work correctly. However, if there exists a Dr⁢(xi) with i≠1 which is not a subset of Dr⁢(x1), then u might not be detected as a hinge vertex by using their algorithm. For example, see Figure 2. We can find that Dr⁢(x1)⊂Dr⁢(x2). If Dr⁢(x1)=∅ or every vertex in Dr⁢(x1) intersects L⁢R⁢(x1), then u cannot be detected as a hinge vertex by only checking the vertices in Dr⁢(x1). In this example, we can find that u is a hinge vertex of x2 and y. Note that y∈Dr⁢(x2)\Dr⁢(x1). This reveals that we have to check the vertices in Dr⁢(x2)\Dr⁢(x1) to determine whether u is a hinge vertex. Accordingly, if x1< x2<⋯<xs and Dr⁢(x1)⊆Dr⁢(x2)⊆⋯⊆Dr⁢(xs), then we have to find the sets Dr(x2)\Dr(x1),Dr(x3)\ Dr⁢(x2),…,Dr⁢(xs)\Dr⁢(xs-1) in linear time so that the hinge vertex problem in permutation graphs can be solved in linear time.

3 An O⁢(n)-time Algorithm for Finding All Hinge Vertices

We first define that A⁢U⁢R=∪i=1n{U⁢R⁢(i)} and A⁢U⁢L= ∪i=1n{U⁢L⁢(i)}. For each u∈A⁢U⁢R, let l⁢(u) (respectively, r(u)) stand for the smallest (respectively, largest) index i of pi with U⁢R⁢(pi)=u.

Similarly, for each u∈A⁢U⁢L, let l′⁢(u) (respectively, r′(u)) stand for the smallest (respectively, largest) index i of pi with U⁢L⁢(pi)=u. Lemma 4 (respectively, Lemma 5) describes the inclusion relation of Dr⁢(py) and Dr⁢(px) (respectively, Dl⁢(px) and Dl⁢(py) ) for two vertices px and py having U⁢R⁢(px)=U⁢R⁢(py) (respectively, UL(px)=UL(py)).

Lemma 4 For each u∈A⁢U⁢R, if there exist two integers x and y such that l⁢(u)+1⩽x<y⩽r⁢(u), then Dr⁢(py)⊆Dr⁢(px)

Proof. Since U⁢R⁢(px)=U⁢R⁢(py)=u, if we can prove that S⁢U⁢R⁢(px)⩽S⁢U⁢R⁢(py), then the lemma follows. First, we consider the case px<py. In this case, the possible value of S⁢U⁢R⁢(px) can be either px⩽S⁢U⁢R⁢(px)<py or py<S⁢U⁢R⁢(px)<u. By definition, S⁢U⁢R⁢(py)⩾py. If px⩽S⁢U⁢R⁢(px)< py, then S⁢U⁢R⁢(px)<py⩽S⁢U⁢R⁢(py). Moreover, if py<S⁢U⁢R⁢(px)<u, then S⁢U⁢R⁢(px)⩽S⁢U⁢R⁢(py)<u. Therefore, the lemma holds for this case (see Figure 3(a)). For the case where py<px, both S⁢U⁢R⁢(px) and S⁢U⁢R⁢(py) are greater than or equal to px. Furthermore, S⁢U⁢R⁢(px) must intersect py. Therefore, S⁢U⁢R⁢(px)⩽S⁢U⁢R⁢(py) (see Figure 3⁢(b) ). This completes the proof.

Lemma 5 For each u∈A⁢U⁢L, if there exist two integers x and y such that l′⁢(u)⩽x<y⩽r′⁢(u)-1, then Dl⁢(px)⊆Dl⁢(py)

Proof. By using a similar argument as in Lemma 4, this lemma follows.

For each u∈A⁢U⁢R and l⁢(u)⩽x⩽r⁢(u), let c⁢(px)=min⁡{pl⁢(u),pl⁢(u)+1,…,px} and Cr⁢(u)= ∪i=l⁢(u)+1r⁢(u){c⁢(pi)}. If Cr⁢(u) is not an empty set, then we may assume without loss of generality that Cr⁢(u)={m1⁢(u),m2⁢(u),…,m|Cr⁢(u)|⁢(u)} and mi⁢(u)<mi+1⁢(u) for 1⩽i⩽|Cr⁢(u)|-1. When context is clear, we simply write mi rather than mi⁢(u). For example, see Figure 1. In Figure 1, P=[8,3,5,2,6,7,1,4] with u=8. Thus, U⁢R⁢(1)= U⁢R⁢(2)=⋯=U⁢R⁢(8)=8,l⁢(u)=1, and r⁢(u)=8. Accordingly, c⁢(8)=8,c⁢(3)=c⁢(5)=3,c⁢(2)=c⁢(6)= c⁢(7)=2,c⁢(1)=c⁢(4)=1, and Cr⁢(u)={1,2,3} in which m1=1,m2=2, and m3=3.

Similarly, we can define c′⁢(px) and Cl⁢(u) for each u∈A⁢U⁢L as follows. For each u∈A⁢U⁢L and l′⁢(u)⩽ x⩽r′⁢(u), let c′⁢(px)=max⁡{px,px+1,…,pr′⁢(u)} and Cl⁢(u)=∪i=l′⁢(u)r′⁢(u)-1{c′⁢(pi)}. If Cl⁢(u) is not an empty set, then we may assume without loss of generality that Cl⁢(u)={m1′⁢(u),m2′⁢(u),…,m|Cl⁢(u)|′⁢(u)} and mi′⁢(u)>mi+1′⁢(u) for 1⩽i⩽|Cl⁢(u)|-1. When context is clear, we simply write mi′ rather than mi′⁢(u).

Lemma 6 Assume that U⁢R⁢(x)=u and y∈Dr⁢(x). If u is a hinge vertex of vertices x and y, then u is a hinge vertex of c⁢(x) and y.

Proof. Since c⁢(x)⩽x, by Lemma 4,Dr⁢(x)⊆ Dr⁢(c⁢(x)). If y∈Dr⁢(x), then y∈Dr⁢(c⁢(x)). By Lemma 2, this lemma holds.

Lemma 7 Assume that U⁢L⁢(x)=u and y∈Dl⁢(x). If u is a hinge vertex of vertices x and y, then u is a hinge vertex of c′⁢(x) and y.

Proof. Since c′⁢(x)⩾x, by Lemma 5,Dl⁢(x)⊆ Dl⁢(c′⁢(x)). If y∈Dl⁢(x), then y∈Dl⁢(c′⁢(x)). By Lemma 3, this lemma holds.

By Lemma 6 (respectively, Lemma 7), we only need to check the vertices in Dr⁢(mi) (respectively, Dl⁢(mi′) ) to determine whether U⁢R⁢(mi) (respectively, U⁢L⁢(mi′) ) is a hinge vertex or not. Note that c⁢(px) can also be expressed recursively as

	
c⁢(px)={min⁡{px,c⁢(px-1)}	 if ⁢x>l⁢(u)
px	 if ⁢x=l⁢(u)
	

for U⁢R⁢(px)=u, and c′⁢(px) can be expressed as

	
c′⁢(px)={max⁡{px,c′⁢(px+1)}	 if ⁢x<r⁢(v)
px	 if ⁢x=r⁢(u)
	

for U⁢L⁢(px)=v. Finding Cr⁢(u) (respectively, Cl⁢(u) ) for all u∈A⁢U⁢R (respectively, u∈AUL) can be done in O⁢(n) time.

By Lemma 4,Dr⁢(mi⁢(u))⊆Dr⁢(mj⁢(u)) for i<j and u∈A⁢U⁢R. To avoid checking the vertices in Dr⁢(mi)∩Dr⁢(mj), for i≠j, repeatedly, denote by Dr′⁢(mi)=Dr⁢(mi)\Dr⁢(mi-1) for i=1,2,…,|Cr⁢(u)| with m0=u and Dl′⁢(mi′)=Dl⁢(mi′)\Dl⁢(mi-1′) for i=1,2,…,|Cl⁢(u)| with m0′=u (see Figure 4 for an illustration of Dr′ ). Consequently,

Figure 4: An illustration of Dr′.

by Lemma 2, we only need to check the vertices, say x, in Dr′⁢(mi) to determine whether u is a hinge vertex of mi and x. Note that the vertices in Dr′⁢(mi) are consecutive on the upper and can be represented by (S⁢U⁢R⁢(mi),S⁢U⁢R⁢(mi-1)+1),i= 2,3,…,|Cr⁢(u)|, namely, Dr′(mi)={x∣SUR(mi)< x<SUR(mi-1)+1},i=2,3,…,|Cr(u)|, and Dr′⁢(m1)={x∣S⁢U⁢R⁢(m1)<x<U⁢R⁢(m1)}. Analogously, Dl′(mi′)={x∣SUL(mi-1′-1)<x< SUL(mi′)},i=2,3,…,|Cl(u)|, and Dl′(m1′)={x∣ UL(m1′)<x<SUL(m1′)}. Therefore, it can be done in O⁢(n) time to check whether u is a hinge vertex for all vertices u∈A⁢U⁢R∪A⁢U⁢L. For example, see Figure 1. Cr⁢(u)={1,2,3} in which m1=1,m2=2, and m3=3. Accordingly, Dr⁢(m1)=∅,Dr⁢(m2)={6,7}, and Dr⁢(m3)={4,5,6,7}. This yields Dr′⁢(m1)=∅, Dr′⁢(m2)={6,7}, and Dr′⁢(m3)={4,5}.

Finally, we are at a position to describe how to modify the algorithm proposed in [5] so that all hinge vertices can be found in O⁢(n) time. We only need to modify Steps 5 and 6 of the algorithm proposed in [5] as follows:

Step 5. Find the sets A⁢U⁢R and Cr⁢(u) for u∈ A⁢U⁢R. Based on Condition (1) of Theorem 5 in [5], use the vertices in Dr′⁢(mi⁢(u)), for i= 1,2,…,|Cr⁢(u)|, to determine whether u is a hinge vertex or not.

Step 6. Find the sets A⁢U⁢L and Cl⁢(u) for u∈ AUL. Based on Condition (2) of Theorem 5 in [5], use the vertices in Dl′⁢(mi′⁢(u)), for i= 1,2,…,|Cl⁢(u)|, to determine whether u is a hinge vertex or not.",1260.68296.tex,1278.68235.tex,None; Deletions

"SUMMARY The meshless method is particularly appropriate to solve crack propagation problems. In this paper, the fatigue growth of cracks in two-dimensional bodies is considered. The analysis is based upon Paris’ equation. New enriched weight functions are introduced in the meshless method formulation to capture the singularity at the crack tip. Simple problems show the accuracy and efficiency of this method. Then, it is applied to fatigue analysis of single- and multi-cracked bodies under mixed-mode conditions","Abstract

Crack propagation and fatigue fracture is studied with an enriched meshless method. This method uses an intrinsic enrichment of the meshless weighting functions such that the correct crack kinematics can be described. The major advantage of the method is its simplicity, especially with respect to implementation. The method is applied to problems in elastostatics where analytical and experimental data is available. We show the higher accuracy of our method in comparison to standard methods for two problems with analytical solutions. Finally, we show the accuracy of the method for interacting flaws.",1060.74664.tex,1258.74210.tex,Variation of subject; Paraphrase
"The propagation is modelled by successive crack extensions, which are determined by the stress intensity factors (SIFs) obtained after a stress analysis. The classic finite element method (FEM) is not appropriate to perform these successive analyses because the computational cost to remesh the body after each crack extension is prohibitive.","One of the most awkward problems encountered in the analysis of crack growth is that remeshing is required near the crack tip as the crack grows. Such remeshing is not only burdensome but it requires projection of variables between the different meshes and causes difficulties during post-processing, for example, when a variable at a spatial point is monitored.",1060.74664.tex,1258.74210.tex,Paraphrase; Deletions; Insertions

"An outline of the paper is as follows. In Section 2, we briefly present the basis of the meshless method and some issues related to its use in fracture mechanics. Then in Section 3, we concentrate upon the way to accurately represent the near-tip displacement field with this method. We recall that a nodal refinement near the tip is the way to capture the singularity used in most papers, and that an enriched basis function set or an enriched trial function set can also be used. Finally, we describe our new method: it consists in adding three nodes with special weight function at each crack tip. In Section 4, we explain the steps of a fatigue crack growth analysis: the computation of the stress intensity factors, the prediction of the propagation direction and of the increment length at each crack tip if the cracks are stable, the instability criterion, and the determination of the number of cycles until unstable crack growth. We provide several numerical examples in Section 5 and draw the conclusions in Section 6.","The outline of the paper is as follows. We first outline the element-free Galerkin (EFG) method.

"Dimopoulos and Landsberg [1], and Giddings and Thomas [2] suggested that, as a consequence of TeV-scale quantum gravity, the production of microscopic black holes at the LHC might be possible. These black holes would decay rapidly into charged leptons and photons with a clean signature and low background. Microscopic black holes offer the possibility of gaining insights into quantum gravity and contribute to efforts to reconcile general relativity and quantum theory. Once the energy threshold is crossed (Planck mass ≈1⁢T⁢e⁢V ), the production of black holes is possible. However, at this scale unknown quantum effects play an important role and the black holes become ""stringy"" and complex. In the present analysis quantum gravity effects are ignored in favour of classical arguments. Black holes decay in four distinct phases: the balding phase, the spin down phase, the Schwarzschild phase and the Planck phase. In this work, the spin-down phase is only considered - this is the phase in which case the Kerr black hole evolves into a Schwarzschild black hole by losing mass through Hawking radiation [3,4] and angular momentum through the Penrose process [5].

Small black holes will decay quickly into charged leptons and photons. Understanding microscopic black holes is important from the point of view of quantum gravity and it also contributes towards reconciling general relativity and quantum theory. The study of decay processes of black holes attained great attention in the last quarter of the last century. The decay process of black holes involve four different phases which include the balding, spin-down, the Schwarzschild and the Planck phases. In this paper we study black holes having both acceleration as well as rotation and analyse how do they lose angular momentum as a result of the Penrose process and mass through Hawking radiation [1,11]. The radial motion (for r>0 ) is classified distinctly for the possible forbidden regions (the regions where the particles have negative kinetic energy). This observation can be made by considering quantum effects because classically the movement of particles is not possible in such regions. The boundaries of these forbidden regions are important to study the mechanism as they are the turning points (contrary to tunnelling) for particles.

"The screening, however, is offset by a competing process: quantum tunneling across the forbidden region. This tunneling reduces the screening effect on the evaporation. The overall effect is the damping of a range of Hawking radiation spectral modes. For particles with lower angular momentum, the screening effect is less pronounced and tunneling is more likely. Therefore, the Hawking radiation spectrum is dominated by low angular momentum modes and high energy modes.

The Penrose process is responsible for the loss of angular momentum of a rotating black hole. Particles entering the ergosphere may be scattered and ejected with greater energy. This process is shielded by the negative kinetic energy region for particles with certain ranges of their energies and angular momenta. For particles with large angular momentum and low energy this region extends beyond the static limit and ""swallows"" the ergosphere. The black hole is completely shielded from such particles and the Penrose process is eliminated. If the negative energy region does not extend to the static limit only partial shielding takes place. In both cases particles can tunnel across the forbidden region in the ergosphere and may or may not contribute to energy extraction. If particle splitting occurs between the event horizon and the lower boundary of the forbidden region, which is never between the horizons, energy extraction can only take place if the particle tunnels back across the potential barrier. For higher angular momentum modes the potential barrier moves ever closer to the event horizon making this effect more and more unlikely.","The screening of particles takes place outside the event horizon or within the ergosphere in forbidden region of a Kerr black hole, where the emitted particles reflect back into the hole with certain ranges of energy and angular momentum. The screening effect may reduce due to quantum tunnelling across the forbidden region from where the particles can tunnel through and escape the black hole. We will see that tunnelling is more likely to occur for particles with lower angular momentum and screening will be less pronounced in this case. This is because the boundary of forbidden regions for low angular momentum modes is not wide enough. Therefore, the spectrum of Hawking radiation is dominated by high energy modes and low angular momentum.

As a result of the Penrose process rotating black holes lose their angular momentum. Particles inflowing the ergosphere are scattered and discharged with greater energy. However, this process is shielded by the regions where the particles have negative kinetic energy. In this process the black hole is either completely or partially shielded by the forbidden region, and it depends on the values of angular momentum and energy of the particle. If the angular momentum is high and energy modes are low the black hole is completely shielded because the forbidden region gets extended beyond the static limit and it swallows the entire ergosphere. Thus the Penrose process is eliminated in this situation. Contrarily, partial shielding takes place when the negative kinetic energy region is not extended towards the static limit. In both cases the particles can tunnel through the forbidden region in the ergosphere and they might contribute to energy extraction. Energy extraction is generally possible when the particles are splitting between the event horizon and static limit with the low angular momentum spectrum and the forbidden region does not extend to the static limit. Otherwise, for high angular momentum, the forbidden regions extend to the static limit and the region of energy extraction reduces.",1451.83039_source.tex,1451.83039.tex,Insertions; Paraphrase

In the limit w→∞, the tunnelling probability (which is proportional to e-2⁢γ ) diminishes exponentially. As the width of the potential barrier decreases: w→0,γ→0 and the likelihood of tunnelling is increased.","6.

"4 Penrose process: shielding

According to Penrose [5], it is possible to extract from a rotating black hole. Consider a particle falling from infinity into a Kerr black hole and splitting into two fragments. The Penrose process occurs when a particle with negative energy is absorbed by the black hole. As a result the hole’s mass and angular momentum decrease. If the process continues, eventually the Kerr black hole would turn into a Schwarzschild black hole. The process depends on negative energy geodesics in the ergosphere. Consider a particle P0 with energy E0 entering the ergosphere and splitting into two with the first particle P1 having energy E1 and the second particle P2 having energy E2. The two particles will fly off in opposite directions, P1 going in the direction of rotation of the black hole and P2 going in the opposing direction. P1 goes into a negative energy orbit and falls into the black hole and P2 emerges form the ergosphere with increased energy E2.

Effectively, P2 gains energy from the ergosphere: E2> E0 - a transfer of energy from the hole to P2. Chandrasekhar determined the efficiency of the process (the ratio of the maximum energy out to the energy in) to be 20.7. [15]. Increased energy extraction efficiency has been demonstrated in recent years by considering modifications to the process. Banados, Silk and West (BSW) [9] considered colliding particles near the event horizon of an extremal black hole resulting in higher energy extraction efficiency due to the high centreof-mass energy of the collision. They proposed that Kerr black holes can act as natural particle accelerators. More recently, Schnittman [10] has demonstrated a new limit of energy extraction efficiency for Compton scattering between a photon and a massive particle. In this mechanism the efficiency can reach 1400%.

The effectiveness of the Penrose process is reduced for particles with energies (ϵ-<ϵ<ϵT) (20) and angular momenta within the range (j-,j+)(17) for r<2⁢M. For particles with energies (ϵ>ϵT) and angular momenta out- side the range (j-,j+)the entire ergosphere is in the forbidden region (r>2⁢M) and there is no Penrose process. Three scenarios are relevant.

Firstly, for particles with energies (ϵ-<ϵ<ϵT) (20) and for angular momenta within the range (j-,j+)⁢(17), the boundary of the forbidden region is below the static limit r3<rs and partial shielding occurs. Particles may enter the ergosphere and energy extraction or particle acceleration can take place. As the angular momentum increases or the energy decreases, the boundary r3 approaches the static limit rs and the area available for energy extraction decreases.

Secondly however, tunneling can take place across the potential barrier and the narrower the forbidden region, the more likely the tunnelling. Some of the particles tunneling across continue on through the event horizon r+and will not take part in the process. Other particles, however, may still undergo the Penrose process between the event horizon r+and the forbidden region r2<r< r3. The negative energy particle falls into the event horizon and slows down the black hole. The particle gaining energy from the ergosphere may tunnel back across the potential barrier, exit the black hole and contribute to the spin-down process. The exiting particle may not tunnel across the potential barrier but may be reflected back at the boundary r2 into the event horizon and thus spin the hole up.

Finally, for particles with (ϵ<ϵT) or for particles with j outside (j-,j+)when (ϵ>⁢ϵT) the negative kinetic energy region extends beyond the static limit (r3>rs) and the black hole is completely shielded. It becomes ""invisible"" to these particles and the Penrose process cannot take place. However, particles can still tunnel across the potential barrier and enter the region above the event horizon and below the forbidden region: r+<r<r2. In a repeat of the above scenario a greatly reduced Penrose process takes place.

The shielding effect of a maximal rotating kerr black hole on a freely falling particle at the staic limit is demonstrated

in Fig. 6a. The shielding effect beyond the static limit is illustrated in terms of the impact parameter (Fig. 6b) and in terms of negative kinetic energy regions for various values of angular momentum and energy (Table 2).","5. Shielding of the penrose process The Penrose mechanism, basically theorized by Roger Penrose [11], states that energy extraction is possible from a rotating black hole. Let us consider a particle falling from infinity towards the accelerating and rotating black hole and split into two pieces. The Penrose process takes place when a particle having negative energy is absorbed by the black hole and causes a reduction in mass and angular momentum of the black hole. If this process continues, the accelerating and rotating black hole ultimately reduces to Schwarzschild black hole. For microscopic black holes, this process causes evaporation of the hole and hence the black hole vanishes. The Penrose mechanism actually depends on the negative kinetic energy regions in the ergosphere.

Let a particle P0 falls in the ergosphere having energy E0 and splits into two particles. Both the particles move in the opposite directions. One of the particles P1 having negative energy E1 goes in the direction of rotation of the hole and the other particle P2 moves in the opposite direction. The particle P1 falls into the black hole and P2 gains more energy from the ergosphere and emerges from the ergosphere with E2>E0. Thus the energy is transferred from the black hole to outgoing particle P2.

The efficiency of this process was analysed by Chandrasekhar [22] and he determined that the ratio of maximum energy out to the energy in is 20.7. Later, it was shown that the efficiency could be enhanced by modifying the process. By analysing the collision of the particles near the event horizon of an extremal black hole, Bañados, Silk and West (BSW) [23] showed that the efficiency of energy extraction increases due to high centre-of-mass energy of the collision. It was also suggested that Kerr black hole can be thought of as a natural particle accelerator. The efficiency in the Compton scattering process [24] between a massive particle and a photon has been shown to reach up to 1400.

In the present study, for r<rs the Penrose process is effectively performed for those particles lying in the ranges (ϵ-<ϵ<ϵ+)defined in Eq. (3.34) for energy and (j-<j<j+)defined in Eq. (3.28) for angular momentum. Beyond the static limit, for particles with energies ϵT<ϵ and angular momentum outside the interval (j-,j+), the whole ergosphere is in the forbidden region and no Penrose process occurs. Therefore, we have two main scenarios to be discussed here. The boundary of the forbidden region lies below the static limit r4<rs, when the energy and angular momentum of the particle lie in (ϵ-<ϵ<ϵT) and (j-,j+)respectively. Particles entering the ergosphere cause the energy extraction or particle acceleration, which results in partial shielding of the black hole. But the region of energy extraction reduces for growing values of angular

"The other boundary of the forbidden region is given by the root r3. As the angular momentum of the particle increases or, as the energy decreases, this boundary extends above the static limit r>2⁢M. Here, a forbidden region exists for a particle with angular momentum in the interval (-∞,j-]∪ [j+,∞) and for kinetic energies above a threshold energy (ϵT). For particles with energy less that ϵT and any angular momentum no radial motion is possible since any r<∞ could be in a forbidden region for certain values of ϵ and j. The root r3 can be determined in terms of r2 by eliminating r1 using Vieta’s relations: r1+r2+r3=-M/A,r1⁢r2+r2⁢r3 +r1⁢r3=(a2⁢A-j2/2)/A,r1⁢r2⁢r3=-M⁢(j-a⁢ϵ)2/A:

r32+r3⁢(MA+r2)-Mr2⁢A⁢(J-a⁢ϵ)2=0

Only the positive root r3 of this equation is of interest. The lower boundary of the forbidden region above the event horizon is at r2=r++δ+. Thus the upper boundary is at:

		×[-1+1+8⁢M⁢(j-a⁢ϵ)2⁢(ϵ2-1)(r++δ+)⁢(2⁢M+(r++δ+)⁢(ϵ2-1))2].	

Similarly, below the Cauchy horizon the upper boundary of the forbidden region extends to r2=r--δ-. and the lower boundary is at r3 :

	r3=	12⁢(2⁢M+(r--δ-)⁢(ϵ2-1)ϵ2-1)	
		×[-1+1+8⁢M⁢(j-a⁢ϵ)2⁢(ϵ2-1)(r--δ-)⁢(2⁢M+(r--δ-)⁢(ϵ2-1))2]	

By expanding the kinetic energy equation (10) in a power series near the Cauchy and near the event horizon, the values of δ±can be approximated by:

δ±=r±⁢[(ϵ⁢M⁢r±-a⁢j2)2+ϵ2⁢M⁢r±2]((ϵ2-1)⁢r±3-j2⁢r±)⁢(r+-M)±(ϵ⁢M⁢r±+a⁢j)⁢(2⁢ϵ⁢M⁢r±+4⁢a⁢j).

Two forbidden regions may exist depending on the values of j and ϵ.","The root r4 gives the other boundary of the forbidden region and it will be mathematically found later in Eq. (3.40). This boundary gets extended above the static limit r>rs, as energy of the particle decreases or angular momentum increases. A forbidden region exists here for particles having angular momenta in the range (-∞,j-)∪(j+,∞) and for kinetic energy above the threshold energy ϵT. Radial motion is not possible for the particles having energy less than ϵT and angular momentum, since for certain values of ϵ and j,r<∞ could be in the forbid so R⁢(r)=0 there. Also r2→r-for large angular momenta. Hence those particles     f interest for which the positive roots r2 and r3 of R⁢(r)=0 may be approximated to the Cauch event horizons for the adjusted values of ϵ and large angular momentum. By the use of Vieta’s relations (3.23) and (3.26), the turning radii r4 can be found in tern r2 and r3, by eliminating the negative root r5. Elimination of r5 from Eqs. (3.23)-(3.26) yields

The signs of the terms are therefore either +,+,-, or +,-,-, so there is only one sign change in each case. As the discriminant is positive for all values of j, the only possible roots are one positive and one negative (Fig. 2a).

Particles with kinetic energy in the range (0,ϵ+)1 and any angular momentum experience a negative kinetic energy region [R⁢(ϵ)<0] and their radial motion is restricted. For ϵ>ϵ+and any j, then R⁢(ϵ)>0, and there is no forbidden region.

Secondly, below the static limit (r<2⁢M), consider the sign changes of the kinetic energy equation (16). In this case the quadratic term is always positive, while the signs of the other terms can be positive or negative. For a⁢j>0, the

(b)

possible signs of the terms are +,-,+, and +,-,-. There are three possibilities: two positive roots, one positive root and one negative root, or two negative roots. When a⁢j<0 the possible signs of the terms are +,+,+, and +,+,-. In this case there is either one positive root and one negative root or two negative roots. The expression for the roots is the same as the case where r>2⁢M (17). The discriminant is positive for all ϵ in this case. So, in the ergosphere, for any ϵ and for angular momentum outside the range (j-,j+), R⁢(j)>0 and a forbidden region does not exists (Fig. 1b)

Now consider again the kinetic equation as a quadratic in ϵ⁢(19). The signs of the coefficients of the quadratic and linear terms are the same as in the previous case (r>2⁢M). However the constant term can now be positive or negative depending on r. For positive values of a⁢j the signs are +,-,+, and +,-,-. For negative values of a⁢j the signs are +,+,+, and +,+,-. The possibilities are two positive roots or one positive and one negative root (j>0) or one positive and one negative or two negative root (no complex roots are possible in this case since the discriminant is positive) (a⁢j<0). Therefore, in the ergosphere a negative kinetic region R⁢(ϵ)<0 exists for particles with energies in the range (ϵ-,ϵ+)and any angular momentum (Fig. 2b).

Particles with kinetic energy and angular momentum within the ranges outlined above experience a negative kinetic energy region and their radial motion is restricted. Outside these ranges of energies angular momentum Hawking radiation particles will escape to infinity and incoming particles will fall into the black hole (Fig. 3).

To summarise, for values of j and ϵ, a forbidden region exists to the right of the event horizon r+. For a forbidden region to exist above the event horizon (r+)and within the ergosphere (below the static limit 2⁢M ) the particle’s kinetic

energy should be in the range (ϵ-,ϵ+)for any angular momentum or its angular momentum should be in the range (j-,j+)for any energy. For a particular value of energy and angular momentum a double root appears just above r+. As j increases further two real roots r2 and r3 appear, forming the boundaries of the forbidden region.

The first of these, above the event horizon r+, occurs for particular values of j and ϵ at r2=r++δ+. From equation (12), the condition under which the root approaches the event horizon (δ+→0) can be determined by requiring:

	
e⁢(r2+a2)-j⁢a→0,
	

or, j→2⁢M⁢ϵ⁢r+/a, as a root approaches the horizon from above and j→2⁢M⁢ϵ⁢r-/a, as a root approaches the Cauchy horizon from below (δ-→0).","In Eq. (3.33), the quadratic term is always positive (r>rc) while thermstant term is always negative and depending on the sign of a⁢j⁢(ϵ>0)⁢t′ term can ositive or negative. Therefore, the terms have either the sign (+,+, for (+,-,-). Since tnere is only one sign change in both cases (also the discriminant (3.34) co ins the squa y terms of j, hence it is positive for any value of j ), therefore, there is only one poss ty of the ence of one positive and one negative root.

Particles encounter a negative kinetic region ∠⁢ϵ+(as the current discussion holds only for unbounded particles but genenc ior any ϵ ) for any value of angular momentum. For ϵ>ϵ+and for any j, the dial unimpeded because R⁢(ϵ)>0 in this case.

Again consider the kinetic energy Eq. (3.3 ow the static limit (r<rs). It has the same sign changes for quadratic and linear terms as dis ed earlier for r>rs except the constant term (which depends on r now). The possible sign o mges for a⁢j>0 are (+,-,-) or (+,-,+). For a⁢j<0 the terms have signs (+,+,-) or (+,+,+). The possibilities are one positive and one negative root, two positive roots or two negative roots. The formula for the roots in this case is same as Eq. (3.34). From Figs. 3 and 4 we see that, in the ergosphere, particles having energies ϵ-<ϵ<ϵ+and any angular momentum experience restricted radial motion because of the existence of the forbidden region in this range.

A region of negative kinetic energy is experienced by particles having energies and angular momentum within the ranges defined above and their radial motion is impeded. When energies and angular momenta are outside these ranges, Hawking radiation particles do not get trapped gravitationally and they escape unopposed to infinity while incoming particles will encounter the forbidden regions and fall into the hole (Fig. 5).

To sum up, two forbidden regions exist but the outer region which is to the right of the event horizon (r+)will contribute as a potential barrier to particles, which play an important role in the study of Hawking radiation screening and Penrose process shielding. The particles that escape the black hole or enter the ergosphere to contribute in the decay process of black hole, will confront this barrier. However, quantum tunnelling can occur to offset these effects. For the existence of the forbidden region above the event horizon, r+, and below the static limit, rs, the energy of the particle must be in the interval (ϵ-,ϵ+)for any angular momentum j, or its angular momentum must be in the interval (j-,j+)for any energy ϵ. A double root appears just above the event horizon for a specific value of angular momentum and energy. As j grows larger these two roots (r3 and r4) will form the boundary of the forbidden region because the forbidden region lies between these two roots and when j grows larger, the forbidden region expands towards r3 and r4.

"Consider next the kinetic energy Eq. (12) as a quadratic in ϵ and j separately, both above the static limit (r>2⁢M) and then below it (r+<r<2⁢M). Any r, except r-<r<r+, can lie in a forbidden region depending on the energy and angular momentum of the particle.

Firstly, for r>2⁢M, as a quadratic in j, the kinetic energy equation:

	
R⁢(j)=(2⁢M-r)⁢j2-4⁢ϵ⁢M⁢a⁢j-Δ⁢r+ϵ2⁢(r3+a2⁢r+2⁢a2⁢M),

The location of these roots is determined by considering the sign changes in (16). The quadratic term is always negative, the linear term can be positive or negative, depending on the sign of a⁢j ( ϵ>0 always) and the constant term can also be positive or negative depending on r. If a⁢j is positive (co-rotating probe and centre) then the signs are -,-,-, or -,-,+, and there is either one positive and one negative root, or two complex roots. If a⁢j is negative (counter-rotating probe and centre) then all possibilities may arise.

Furthermore, for real roots to exist, the kinetic energy of the particle must be above the threshold energy:

ϵ>ϵT=r-2⁢Mr.

Only then the discriminant of (16) is positive (Fig. 1a). For particles with energy greater than ϵT and angular momentum in the range (j-,j+), there is no forbidden region. For particles with ϵ>ϵT and angular momentum outside the interval (j-,j+)or with ϵ<ϵT and any j, only circular motion is possible, since the forbidden region extends for all r>2⁢M.

"If ϵ<1, the particle cannot escape and the trajectory is bound. If ϵ=1 the particle is marginally bound i.e. falling towards the hole from a state of rest at infinity and if ϵ>1, the particle is unbound. In this work, unbound particles ϵ>1 are considered only. Such particles with certain values of j and ϵ undergo scattering by the negative kinetic energy region outside of the black hole (or tunnel across it).

Consider R⁢(r) as a cubic in r, i.e.:

R⁢(r)=A⁢r3+M⁢r2+(a2⁢A-j22)⁢r+M⁢(a⁢ϵ-j)2,

where A=(ϵ2-1)/2>0.

Firstly, if a2⁢A>j2/2, the coefficient of the r term in Eq. (15) is positive. All other terms in the equation are positive as well (+,+,+,+) and so, there are no sign changes. By Descartes’ rule of signs, there can only be two situations, either one negative root and two complex roots, or three negative roots. Vieta’s relations result in: r1+r2+r3=-M/A,r1⁢r2+r2⁢r3+r1⁢r3=(a2⁢A-j2/2)/A, r1⁢r2⁢r3=-M⁢(j-a⁢ϵ)2/A. In this scenario, the centre is a boundary of a forbidden region if j=a⁢ϵ.

Secondly, when a2⁢A<j2/2, the coefficient of the linear term in Eq. (15) is negative with all others positive and one of the terms in the equation being negative (+,+,-,+) leads to two sign changes. There can be three situations: one negative root and two positive roots; one negative root and two complex roots; or three negative roots. The last situation cannot arise due to Vieta’s restriction: r1⁢r2+r2⁢r3+r1⁢r3= (a2⁢A-j2/2)/A - for three negative roots the left hand side is positive while the right hand side is negative.","When ϵ<1, the trajectory is bounded and particles cannot escape from th rk hole. In the case ϵ=1, particles’ trajectories are marginally bounded which means they fall n a state of rest at infinity towards the hole. For ϵ>1 particles are unbounded. In this analy,s, we only consider unbound particles (ϵ>1) because the other two situations of particle trajectories do not give any new insight. Unbounded trajectories undergo scattering with certain values of j and ϵ due to the negative kinetic energy outside the black hole (or because they tunnel through it). We consider Eq. (3.15), which is of order five

In this situation, if j=a⁢ϵ the centre is the boundary of the forbidden region.

Here, we will focus our attention on the later situation where the four positive roots are r1<r2<r3<r4 and r5 is the negative root. (If one of the four positive roots is double, treble or quadruple, the situation does not add new insight therefore will not be studied separately). Classically, there exist two forbidden regions, i.e. R⁢(r)<0 for r1<r<r2 and r3<r<r4. Quantum tunnelling can occur between r3 and r4. Since the horizons r±are not in the forbidden region, therefore, either they exist to the right of r4 or between r2 and r3.

"For the present analysis, only radial motion in the equatorial plane is considered. Therefore θ=π/2 and θ˙=0. Hence K=0. Equation (6) gives the kinetic energy per unit mass of the particle:

	r2˙2=	12⁢(ϵ2-1)+1r⁢M+12⁢r2⁢[a2⁢(ϵ2-1)-j2]	
		+1r3⁢M⁢(a⁢ϵ-j)2	

where ϵ=E/m is the specific energy the particle and j=J/m is its specific angular momentum. Equation (10) is that of a one dimensional effective motion with specific energy of the one dimensional motion given by (ϵ2-1)/2 and effective potential:

	Veff ⁢(r)=	-1r⁢M-12⁢r2⁢[a2⁢(ϵ2-1)-j2]

To determine the boundaries of the classically forbidden region, which is characterised by negative kinetic energy, one needs to locate the roots of the equation R⁢(r)=r4⁢r˙2=0. It is instructive to consider this equation from different perspectives. Firstly consider Carter’s equation (6) in the equatorial plane:

R⁢(r)=[e⁢(r2+a2)-j⁢a]2-Δ⁢[r2+(j-a⁢e)2].

In the Kerr black hole, the time-like Killing vector (∂t)μ becomes null at the static limit:

-gt⁢t=1-2⁢M⁢rρ2

with boundary given by:

rs=M+M2-a2⁢cos2⁡θ.

The region between the event horizon r+and the static limit rs is called the ergosphere. In this region all particles must rotate with the black hole due to frame dragging. In this region, negative energy states are possible aswell, because at the static limit ∂/∂⁡t becomes space-like and can be positive or negative. Hence, the conserved energy E=(1/m)⁢∂⁡L/∂⁡t˙ can be positive or negative.

In the equatorial plane, the static limit rs is 2⁢M. The location of the Cauchy horizon r-and the event horizon r+are: r±=M±M2-a2 respectively. From (12), it is evident that there can be no region of negative energy between the horizons: the term Δ=r2-2⁢M⁢r+a2 is always negative between the horizons and hence R⁢(r) is strictly positive. A forbidden region, therefore, cannot exist between the horizons - forbidden regions, if they exist, lie to the right of r+ or to the left of r-.","The kinetic energy per unit mass of the particle is given as

The nature of the roots of equation R⁢(r)=r3⁢r˙2=0 needs to be analysed in order to characterize the boundaries of classically forbidden regions, which are the regions of negative kinetic energy. Consideration of this equation from a different perspective is useful. Initially, Carter’s Eq. (3.5) in the equatorial plane is considered as

	
R⁢(r)=[ϵ⁢(r2+a2)-j⁢a]2-Q⁢[r2-(j-a⁢ϵ)2].

and it gives two static limits corresponding to rotation and acceleration, which are calculated numerically as rs⁢(r⁢o⁢t)=2.08158⁢M and rs⁢(a⁢c⁢c)=4.46042⁢M. The region between the event horizon, r+, and the static limit, rs, is termed as ”ergosphere”. Due to frame dragging, all the particles rotate in this region with the black hole. This region may contain negative energy states, hence a forbidden region, because ∂/∂⁡t becomes space-like at the static limit and may be positive or negative. Thus, the conserved energy E=(1/m)⁢(∂⁡L/∂⁡t˙) may also be positive or negative.

In the equatorial plane, there are two static limits, and the horizons of the black hole can be determined by

	
gr⁢r=Q⁢Ω2ρ2=0.
	

It is easy to verify from the above equation that the positions of the event horizon r=r+and Cauchy horizon r=r-are

	
r±=M±M2+a2,
	

which are same as for the Kerr black hole. However, in the present case, we have other horizons at ra=1/α and rα=1/α⁢cos⁡θ, which are already familiar in the context of the C-metric as the acceleration horizons [8,10,15]. The physical region of the black hole is r-<r<r+in which Q<0. For small range of values of acceleration (0<α<0.1), as considered in this study, the acceleration horizon specifically is not compatible with its static limit. So, the only static limit which will be under consideration in this study is r=rs=2.08158⁢M. Obviously there must be no region of negative kinetic energy between the horizans as Q=(r2-2⁢M⁢r+a2)⁢(1-r2⁢α2) is always negative there and R⁢(r) in Eq.

The radial motion of massive particles in the equatorial plane of a Kerr black hole is considered. Screening of the Hawking radiation and shielding of the Penrose process are examined (both inside and outside the ergosphere) and their effect on the evaporation of the black hole is studied. In particular, the locus and width of a classically forbidden region and their dependence on the particle’s angular momentum and energy is analysed. Tunneling of particles between the boundaries of this region is considered and the transmission coefficient determined.","Article history: We study the screening effect of Hawking radiation and shielding Received 13 April 2020 of particles in the Penrose process in accelerating and rotating Accepted 28 June 2020 black holes.

"Abstract

We study the tunneling zone solutions of a one-dimensional electrostatic potential for the relativistic (Dirac to Klein-Gordon) wave equation when the incoming wave packet exhibits the possibility of being almost totally transmitted through the barrier. The transmission probabilities, the phase times and the dwell times for the proposed relativistic dynamics are obtained and the conditions for the occurrence of accelerated tunneling transmission are all quantified. We show that, in some limiting cases, the analytical difficulties that arise when the stationary phase method is employed for obtaining phase (traversal) tunneling times are all overcome. Lessons concerning the phenomenology of the relativistic tunneling suggest revealing insights into condensed-matter experiments using electrostatic barriers for which the accelerated tunneling effect can be observed.","Abstract We obtain the solutions for the tunneling zone of a one-dimensional electrostatic potential in the relativistic (Dirac to Klein-Gordon) wave equation regime when the incoming wave packet exhibits the possibility of being almost totally transmitted through the potential barrier.

"In all cases described by the non-relativistic (Schroedinger) dynamics [4], the pulse (wave packet) that emerges from the tunneling process is greatly attenuated and frontloaded due to the filter effect (only the leading edge of the incident wave packet survives the tunneling process without being severely attenuated to the point that it cannot be detected). If one measures the speed by the peak of the pulse, it looks like a speed faster than that of the incident wave packet. Since the transmission probability depends analytically on the momentum component k⁢(T≡T⁢(k)) the initial (incident wave) momentum distribution can completely be distorted by the presence of the barrier of potential. As there is no sharp beginning to a pulse, we cannot determine the instant of its arrival at a certain point. Thus, the computation of the tunneling time becomes fundamentally meaningless. We could only watch the rising edge of the pulse and try to recognize what is arriving.

By observing the tunneling dynamics described by the relativistic Dirac/Klein-Gordon equation, we can overcome all of these difficulties. We demonstrate with complete mathematical accuracy that, in some limiting cases of the relativistic (Klein) tunneling phenomena where the relativistic kinetic energy is approximately equal to the potential energy of the barrier, and m⁢c⁢L/ℏ≪1, particles with mass m can pass through a potential barrier V0 of width L with transmission probability T approximately equal to one. Since T∼1, the analytical conditions for the applicability of the stationary phase principle, which determines the tunneling (phase) time for the transmitted wave packets, are totally recovered. Differently from the previous (non-relativistic) tunneling analysis, the original momentum is kept undistorted and there is no filter effect. We shall demonstrate that the tunneling time is then computed for a completely undistorted transmitted wave packet, which legitimizes any eventual accelerated transmission.","In all cases described by the non-relativistic (Schroedinger) dynamics [5], the pulse (wave packet) that emerges from the tunneling process is greatly attenuated and front-loaded due to the filter effect (only the leading edge of the incident wave packet survives the tunneling process without being severally attenuated to the point that it cannot be detected).

"2 Defining the dynamics, variables and limits

It is very difficult and probably even confusing to treat all interactions of plane waves or wave packets with a barrier potential using a relativistic wave equation [29-32]. This is because the physical content depends upon the relation between the barrier height V0 and the mass m of the incoming (particle) wave, beside its total energy E. In the first attempt to evaluate this problem, Klein [33] considered the reflection and transmission of electrons of incidence energy E on the potential step V⁢(x)=Θ⁢(x)⁢V0 in the (2+1)-dimensional time-independent Dirac equation, which can be represented in terms of the usual Pauli matrices [34] by 2

	
[σ3⁢σi⁢∂i-(E-Θ⁢(x1)⁢V0)-σ3⁢m]⁢ϕ⁢(k,x1,x2)=0
	

(from this point on c=ℏ=1 ), which corresponds to the reduced representation of the usual Pauli-Dirac gamma matrix representation (i=1,2). The physical essence of such a theoretical configuration lies in the prediction that fermions can pass through large repulsive potentials without exponential damping. It corresponds to the so called Klein tunneling phenomenon [30], which follows accompanied by the production of a particle-antiparticle pair inside the potential barrier. It is different from the usual tunneling effect since it occurs in the energy zone of the Klein paradox [33,34]. Taking the quadratic form of the above equation reduced to (1+1)-dimension for a generic scalar potential V⁢(x), we obtain the analogous Klein-Gordon equation,

	
(i⁢∂0-V⁢(x))2⁢ϕ⁢(k,x)=(-∂x2+m2)⁢ϕ⁢(k,x),
	

which, from the mathematical point of view, due to the second-order spatial derivatives, has boundary conditions similar to those of the Schroedinger equation and leads to stationary wave solutions characterized by a relativistically modified dispersion relation.

By depicting three potential regions by means of a rectangular potential barrier V⁢(x),V⁢(x)=V0 if 0≤x≤L,

2⁢Θ⁢(x) is the Heavyside function. and V⁢(x)=0 if x<0 and x>L, differently from the nonrelativistic (Schroedinger) dynamics, we observe that the incident energy can be divided into three zones. The above barrier energy zone, E>V0+m, involves diffusion phenomena of oscillatory waves (particles). In the so called Klein zone [30,33], E<V0-m, we find oscillatory solutions (particles and antiparticles) in the barrier region. In this case, antiparticles see an electrostatic potential opposite to that seen by the particles, and hence they will see a well potential where the particles see a barrier [35-38]. The tunneling zone, V0-m<E<V0+m, for which only evanescent waves exist [39,40] in the barrier region, is that of interest in this work.","Some authors consider difficult and perhaps confusing the treatment of all interactions of plane waves or wave packets with a barrier potential using a relativistic wave equation 12, 13, 14, 15].

In a causal manner, the above arguments might consist in explaining the superluminal phenomena during tunneling as simply due to a reshaping of the pulse, with attenuation, as already attempted (at the classical limit) [46], i.e. the later parts of an incoming pulse are preferentially attenuated, in such a way that the outcoming peak appears shifted towards earlier times even if it is nothing but a portion of the incident pulse’s forward tail [6,43].","We can notice the possibility of accelerated (tφ<τ(k)), and eventually superluminal (negative tunneling delays, tφ<0 ) transmissions without recurring to the usual analysis of the opaque limit (ρ⁢(n)⁢w⁢L→∞) which leads to the Hartman effect [10]. In the NR dynamics (Schroedinger equation solutions), the opaque limit and its consequent superluminal interpretation (Hartman effect) were extensively discussed in the literature.

FIG. 1: Tunneling TRANSMISSION probabilities and the corresponding tunneling PHASE times for the dynamics of the relativistic wave equation. We have classified the energy zones by the line thickness: the thick line corresponds to the tunneling energy zone, the intermediate line corresponds to the Klein zone and the thin line corresponds to the above barrier energy zone. In fact the tunneling region is comprised by the interval intersection (n2-v/2)2<1 and n2>0. Here we have adopted the illustratively convenient value of w⁢L=2⁢π. We have set v=0,1,2,5,10 and we have constrained our analysis to n2⁢(k)>0 since we have assumed V0>0.

LAZAAR et al./Turk J Math Proof ( ) Suppose that the graph of the specialization order has no chains of length greater than 2 and all chains of length 2 contain a common minimal point m. If A is not closed in (X,τ) then it is not a down-set in (X,≤), so A contains points x∈↑m, and m∉A. But any set not containing m is an upper-set, and therefore it is open. If the common point M were maximal, the dual argument applies. (If A is not open, then it is not an upper-set, so A contains points x∈↓M and M∉A. But any set not containing M is a down-set and therefore closed.) (⟹) Suppose the condition on the specialization order fails. Then either there exists a chain with three distinct points a<b<d or there exists chains a<b and c<d of length 2 with no common point. In either case, {a,d} is neither increasing nor decreasing, and thus neither open not closed. Thus, (X,τ) is not a door space. 2.3.

Proof ( ⟸ ) Suppose that the graph of the specialization order has no chains of length greater than 2 and all chains of length 2 contain a common minimal point m. If A is not closed in (X,τ) then it is not a lower set in (X,≤), so A contains points x∈↑m, and m∉A. But any set not containing m is an upper set, and therefore it is open. If the common point M is maximal, the dual argument applies. (If A is not open, then it is not an upper-set, so A contains points x∈↓M and M∉A. But any set not containing M is a down-set and therefore closed.) (⟹) Suppose the condition on the specialization order fails. Then either there exists a chain with three distinct points a<b<d or there exists chains a<b and c<d of length 2 with no common point. In either case, {a,d} is neither increasing nor decreasing, and thus neither open not closed. Thus, (X,τ) is not a door space. 2.3 Whyburn and Weakly Whyburn Alexandroff Spaces In a topological space X a subset F is called almost closed if and only if F¯\F={x} for some x∈X, which can be abbreviated by the notation F⟶x. The topological space X is called a Whyburn space [17] if for every non-closed subset A of X and for every x∈A¯\A, there exists B⊆A such that B¯\A={x} or equivalently, there exists B⊆A such that B⟶x. It is called weakly Whyburn [19] if for every non-closed subset A of X there exists B⊆A such that B¯\A is a one point set. Clearly, every Whyburn space is weakly Whyburn. Whyburn spaces and weakly Whyburn spaces were studied in [16,21] and denoted respectively by AP-spaces and WAP-spaces. Theorem 2.4 Let (X,τ) be an Alexandroff space. Then the following statements are equivalent: 1. X is Whyburn; 2. X is weakly Whyburn; 3. The closure of each element of X has at most 2 points, that is, |↓x|≤2.",1497.54028.tex,1498.54029.tex,Paraphrase

"2. Connections of Roots. Decompositions From now on we consider Λ to be symmetrical in the following sense: If α∈Λ then -α∈Λ. We will follow the next procedure in our study of the inner structure of the split Malcev Poisson algebras with a root system Λ and the corresponding root decomposition⁡P=H⊕(⨁α∈ΛPα). 512

Procedure: 1. Define some equivalence ∼ on the set of nonzero roots Λ. 2. Associate an adequate ideal of P to each coset in the quotient set Λ/∼ induced by the equivalence. 3. Verify that the set of ideals of P obtained at the previous step allows us to establish our structural theorems.

To define the connection on the set of nonzero roots Λ we have to look at Λ regarded just as a subset of the dual vector space of H, denoted as usual by

	
H*:={α:H→𝕂⁢ such that ⁢α⁢ is linear }.
	

To introduce the concept of connection of nonzero roots of a split Malcev Poisson algebra, we begin by putting

	
Ω:={α∈Λ:{Pα,P-α}≠0}∪{α∈Λ:{{Pβ,P-β},Pα}≠0⁢ for some ⁢β∈Λ}
	

Since Λ is symmetrical and {Pβ,P-β}⊂H, the skew-symmetry of the product joint with the fact that α⁢({Pβ,P-β})≠0 implies -α⁢({Pβ,P-β})≠0. Therefore, we find that if α∈Ω then -α∈Ω. We associate to each α∈Ω the symbol θα and put ΘΩ:={θα:α∈Ω}. Let us define the mapping

Since {Pβ,Pδ}≠0; therefore, β+δ∈Λ and {β,δ} is a connection from β to β+δ. The transitivity of ∼ leads to β+δ∈[α] and so {Pβ,Pδ}⊂Pβ+δ⊂V[α].

Taking into account that [Pβ,Pδ]≠0 joint with Lemma 1.3-i) ensures β+δ∈Λ, we have that {β,δ} is a connection from β to β+δ. The transitivity of ∼ gives now that β+δ∈[α] and so [Pβ,Pδ]⊂Pβ+δ⊂V[α]. Finally, in case δ=β we proceed as above with Lemma 1.3-ii) to get either 2⁢β∈Λ or -β∈Λ, and considering the connections {β,β} or {β}, respectively, we have by transitivity that 2⁢β∼α or -β∼α, respectively, and again [Pβ,Pβ]⊂P2⁢β+P-β⊂V[α].

By the above and Proposition 2.4, we can assert

	
I[α]⁢P=I[α]⁢(H⊕(⨁β∈[α]Pβ)⊕(⨁γ∉[α]Pγ))⊂I[α].
	

In a similar way we get P⁢I[α]⊂I[α], and so I[α] is an ideal of P. (ii): The simplicity of P implies I[α]=P. From here, it is clear that [α]=Λ and

	
H=∑α∈Λ({Pα,P-α}+Pα⁢P-α).

","Let us show that any I[α] is actually an ideal of the MPJ-algebra P. Also, we recall that a MPJ-algebra P is simple if [P,P]≠0,P⁢P≠0 and its only ideals are {0},P.

Theorem 2.4.

The following assertions hold.

i)

For any [α]∈Λ/∼, the linear subspace

	
I[α]=IH,[α]⊕V[α]
	

of P associated to [α] is an ideal of P.

ii)

If P is simple, then there exists a connection from α to β for any α,β∈Λ and H=∑α∈Λ([Pα,P-α]+Pα⁢P-α).

Proof.

i) Since [IH,[α],H]⊂[H,H]=0 and [V[α],H]⊂V[α] we get [I[α],H]⊂V[α]. Using Proposition 2.3 we obtain

	
[I[α],P]=[I[α],H⊕(⨁β∈[α]Pβ)⊕(⨁δ∉[α]Pδ)]⊂I[α].
	

Now we need to prove that I[α]⁢P⊂I[α]. First, we observe that for any β∈[α], using Lemma 1.3-iii) and since H is abelian, we have

(16)		
(Pβ⁢P-β)⁢H⊂P0⁢H=0.
	

By Equation (1) we also have

(17)		
[Pβ,P-β]⁢H	⊂[Pβ,P-β⁢H]+P-β⁢[Pβ,H]⊂[Pβ,P-β]+Pβ⁢P-β.
	

From Equations (16) and (17) we get IH,[α]⁢H⊂IH,[α] and, taking into account V[α]⁢H⊂V[α], we conclude

	
I[α]⁢H⊂I[α].
	

Similarly, we get I[α]⁢H⊂V[α] since IH,[α]⁢H⊂H⁢H=0 and V[α]⁢H⊂V[α]. Using again Proposition 2.3 we obtain

	
I[α]⁢P=I[α]⁢(H⊕(⨁β∈[α]Pβ)⊕(⨁γ∉[α]Pγ))⊂I[α].
	

Therefore I[α] is an ideal of P.

ii) The simplicity of P implies I[α]=P. From here, it is clear that [α]=Λ and H=∑α∈Λ([Pα,P-α]+Pα⁢P-α). ∎",1484.17036.tex,1498.17008.tex,Variation of subject; Paraphrase; Different Presentation

P=∑[α]∈Λ⁣/∼I[α].
	

In order to verify the direct character of the sum, consider

	
v∈I[α]∩(∑[γ]∈Λ⁣/∼,[γ]≠[α]I[γ]).
	

Since v∈I[α], the fact {I[α],I[γ]}=I[α]⁢I[γ]=I[γ]⁢I[α]=0 in case [α]≠[γ] gives us

Considering that v∈∑[γ]∈Λ⁣/∼,[γ]≠[α]I[γ], the above implies

	
{v,I[α]}=v⁢I[α]=I[α]⁢v=0.

3. Simple Components In this section we will study the conditions for a split Malcev Poisson algebra to decompose into the direct sum of the family of its simple ideals. From now on, we assume that char⁡(𝕂)=0.

Lemma 3.1. Let P=H⊕(⨁α∈ΛPα) be a split Malcev Poisson algebra. If I is an ideal of P then

	
I=(I∩H)⊕(⨁α∈Λ(I∩Pα)).
	

Proof. This is obvious. Lemma 3.2. Let P be a split Malcev Poisson algebra such that 𝒵⁢(P)=0 and

	
H=∑α∈Λ({Pα,P-α}+Pα⁢P-α).
	

If I is an ideal of P satisfying I⊂H then I={0}. Proof. Suppose that there exists a nonzero ideal I of P such that I⊂H. Then

	
{I,H}⊂{H,H}=0.
	

Also, the fact

	
{I,⨁α∈ΛPα}+I⁢(⨁α∈ΛPα)+(⨁α∈ΛPα)⁢I⊂I⊂H
	

joint with Lemma 1.3 implies

	
{I,⨁α∈ΛPα}+I⁢(⨁α∈ΛPα)+(⨁α∈ΛPα)⁢I⊂H∩(⨁α∈ΛPα)=0
	

Since

	
H=∑α∈Λ({Pα,P-α}+Pα⁢P-α);
	

using the Leibniz identity, (19), and associativity we conclude that I⁢H=H⁢I=0. Hence, I⊂𝒵⁢(P)=0; a contradiction.

Let us introduce the concepts of root-multiplicativity and maximal length in the framework of split Malcev Poisson algebras in much the same way as those for split Lie algebras, split Malcev algebras, split Poisson algebras, and split Lie-Rinehart algebras (see [7, 8, 11, 12] along these notions and examples). Definition 3.3. We say that a split Malcev Poisson algebra P is root-multiplicative if given α,β∈Λ such that either α⋆β∈Λ or θα⋆β∈Λ, then {Pα,Pβ}≠0 and Pα⁢Pβ≠0 or {{Pα,P-α},Pβ}≠0, respectively.

Definition 3.4. A split Malcev Poisson algebra P is of maximal length if dim⁡Pα=1 for all α∈Λ. We would like to note that the above concepts appear in a natural way in the study of split Malcev Poisson algebras. For instance, each Poisson structure associate to a finite-dimensional semisimple Lie algebra gives rise to a root-multiplicative split Poisson algebra of maximal length. We also have, in the infinite-dimensional setting, that every Poisson structure 𝒫 defined either on a semisimple separable L*-algebra (see [13,14] ) or a semisimple locally finite split Lie algebra (see [15]) necessarily makes 𝒫 a root-multiplicative split Poisson algebra of maximal length. 518

Theorem 3.5. Let P be a root-multiplicative split Malcev Poisson algebra of maximal length such that 𝒵⁢(P)=0. Then P is simple if and only if P has all its nonzero roots connected and H= ∑α∈Λ({Pα,P-α}+Pα⁢P-α).

Proof. If P is simple, then the implication was proved in Theorem 2.5(ii). To prove the converse, consider I as a nonzero ideal of P. By Lemmas 3.1 and 3.2 we can write

	
I=(I∩H)⊕(⨁α∈ΛI(I∩Pα))
	

with ΛI:={α∈Λ:I∩Pα≠0} and ΛI≠∅. By the maximal length hypothesis we rewrite ΛI={α∈ Λ:Pα⊂I}

Let us show that H⊂I. We take α0∈ΛI, and so Pα0⊂I. Now, for each β∈Λ\{2⁢α0,-2⁢α0}, the fact that α0 and β are connected and the root-multiplicativity of P give us a connection {γ1,…,γr} from α0 to β such that

	
γ1=α0,γ1⋆γ2,(γ1⋆γ2)⋆γ3,…,
(⋯⁢((γ1⋆γ2)⋆γ3)⋆⋯)⋆γr-1∈Λ∪ΘΩ,
(⋯⁢((γ1⋆γ2)⋆γ3)⋆⋯)⋆γr∈{β,-β}
	

and

	
{{…⁢{{Pα0,Pγ2},Pγ3},…},Pγr}=Pε⁢β
	

with ε∈{1,-1}. Hence, either Pβ⊂I or P-β⊂I. In both cases {Pβ,P-β}⊂I and Pβ⁢P-β⊂I. Thus, from

	
H=∑β∈Λ({Pβ,P-β}+Pβ⁢P-β)
	

it follows that

	
H\{{P2⁢α0,P-2⁢α0}+P2⁢α0⁢P-2⁢α0}⊂I.
	

Since α0∈ΛI, by the maximal length hypothesis and Lemma 1.3 we get P2⁢α0=Pα0⁢Pα0⊂I, and so we can assert that

	
H⊂I.
	

Given α∈Λ and using α≠0 and (20), we now get {H,Pα}=Pα⊂I. We conclude that I=P, and so P is simple.

Theorem 3.6. Let P be a root-multiplicative split Malcev Poisson algebra of maximal length such that 𝒵⁢(P)=0 and

	
H=∑α∈Λ({Pα,P-α}+Pα⁢P-α).
	

Then

	
P=⨁[α]∈Λ⁣/∼I[α],
	

where each I[α] is a simple ideal having its root system, ΛI[α], with all its roots connected and satisfying {I[α],I[γ]}=I[α]⁢I[γ]=0 if [α]≠[γ]

Proof. By Corollary 2.8,P=⨁[α]∈Λ⁣/∼I[α] is the direct sum of the ideals I[α]=IH,[α]⊕V[α], where

	
IH,[α]=spanK⁡{{Pβ,P-β}+Pβ⁢P-β:β∈[α]},
	

having each I[α] as the root system ΛI[α]=[α]. In order to apply Theorem 3.5 to each I[α], observe that the fact ΛI[α]=[α] gives us easily that ΛI[α] has all elements connected through connections lying 519

in ΛI[α]. We also have that each I[α] is root multiplicative as a consequence of the root-multiplicativity of P. Clearly, I[α] is of maximal length because P is itself of maximal length. Finally, 𝒵I[α]⁢(I[α])=0 (where 𝒵I[α]⁢(I[α]) denotes the center of I[α] in itself) as a consequence of 𝒵⁢(P)=0 and {I[α],I[γ]}= I[α]⁢I[γ]=0 if [α]≠[γ] (Corollary 2.8). We can apply Theorem 3.5 to each I[α] which allows us to conclude that I[α] is simple. It is clear that P=⨁[α]∈Λ⁣/∼I[α] satisfies the claims of the theorem.","3. The simple components

In this section we are interested in studying under which conditions a split Malcev-Poisson-Jordan algebra decomposes as the direct sum of the family of its simple ideals. From now on, we assume Λ is symmetric (in the sense α∈Λ implies -α∈Λ) and char⁢(𝕂)=0.

Lemma 3.1.

Let P=H⊕(⨁α∈ΛPα) be a split Malcev-Poisson-Jordan algebra. If I is an ideal of P then I=(I∩H)⊕(⨁α∈Λ(I∩Pα)).

Proof.

Consider the set A⁢d:={ad⁢(h):h∈H}, being ad⁢(h)⁢(x):=[h,x] for any x∈P. The result follows from the fact that A⁢d is a commuting set of diagonalizable endomorphisms, and I is invariant under this set. ∎

Lemma 3.2.

Let P=H⊕(⨁α∈ΛPα) be a split Malcev-Poisson-Jordan algebra with 𝒵⁢(P)=0. If I is an ideal of P such that I⊂H then I={0}.

Proof.

Suppose that I is an ideal of P such that I⊂H. Since H is abelian we have [I,H]⊂[H,H]=0 and I⁢H⊂H⁢H=0. The fact

	
[I,⨁α∈ΛPα]+I⁢(⨁α∈ΛPα)⊂I⊂H
	

joint with Lemma 1.3 implies

	
[I,⨁α∈ΛPα]+I⁢(⨁α∈ΛPα)⊂H∩(⨁α∈ΛPα)=0,
	

thus [I,P]=0 and I⁢P=0. Therefore, we have showed I⊂𝒵⁢(P)=0. ∎

Let us introduce the concepts of root-multiplicativity and maximal length in the framework of split Malcev-Poisson-Jordan algebras, in a similar way to the ones for split Lie algebras, split Malcev algebras, split Poisson algebras and split Lie-Rinehart algebras (see [2, 3, 4, 5] for these notions and examples).

Definition 3.3.

We say that a split Malcev-Poisson-Jordan algebra P is root-multiplicative if given α,β∈Λ such that either α⋆β∈Λ or θα⋆β∈Λ, then either [Pα,Pβ]≠0 and Pα⁢Pβ≠0, or [[Pα,P-α],Pβ]≠0, respectively.

Definition 3.4.

A split Malcev-Poisson-Jordan algebra P is of maximal length if dim⁡Pα=1 for any α∈Λ.

We would like to note that the above concepts appear in a natural way in the study of split Malcev-Poisson-Jordan algebras. For instance, any Poisson structure associate to a semisimple finite dimensional Lie algebra gives rise to a root-multiplicative and of maximal length split Poisson algebra. We also have, in the infinite-dimensional setting, that any Poisson structure 𝒫 defined either on a semisimple separable L*-algebra [7, 8] or on a semisimple locally finite split Lie algebra [9] necessarily makes 𝒫 a root-multiplicative and of maximal length split Poisson algebra.

Theorem 3.5.

Let P be a root-multiplicative split Malcev-Poisson-Jordan algebra of maximal length. It holds that P is simple if and only if it has all its non-zero roots connected and H=∑α∈Λ([Pα,P-α]+Pα⁢P-α).

Proof.

If P is simple, the necessary condition was proved in Theorem 2.4-ii). To prove the converse, consider I a non-zero ideal of P. By Lemmas 3.1 and 3.2 we can write

	
I=(I∩H)⊕(⨁α∈ΛI(I∩Pα))
	

with ΛI:={α∈Λ:I∩Pα≠0} and ΛI≠∅. By maximal length we also can write ΛI={α∈Λ:Pα⊂I}.

Let us show that H⊂I. We take α0∈ΛI, so Pα0⊂I. Now, for any β∈Λ∖{2⁢α0,-2⁢α0}, the fact that α0 and β are connected gives us a connection {γ1,…,γr} from α0 to β such that

	
γ1=α0,γ1⋆γ2,(γ1⋆γ2)⋆γ3,…,(⋯⁢((γ1⋆γ2)⋆γ3)⋆⋯)⋆γr-1∈Λ∪ΘΩ
	
	
(⋯⁢((γ1⋆γ2)⋆γ3)⋆⋯)⋆γr∈{β,-β},
	

and by maximal length and the root-multiplicativity of P we get

	
[[…⁢[[Pα0,Pγ2],Pγ3],…],Pγr]=Pϵ⁢β, with⁢ϵ∈{1,-1}.
	

From here, we deduce that either Pβ⊂I or P-β⊂I. In both cases [Pβ,P-β]⊂I and Pβ⁢P-β⊂I. From here, the fact H=∑β∈Λ([Pβ,P-β]+Pβ⁢P-β) implies H∖{[P2⁢α0,P-2⁢α0]+P2⁢α0⁢P-2⁢α0}⊂I. Since α0∈ΛI, by maximal length and Lemma 1.3-iii) we get P2⁢α0=Pα0⁢Pα0⊂I, and consequently we can assert

(20)		
H⊂I.
	

Given now any α∈Λ, the fact α≠0 and Equation (20) show Pα=[H,Pα]⊂I. We conclude I=P and therefore P is simple as required. ∎

Theorem 3.6.

Let P be a root-multiplicative split Malcev-Poisson-Jordan algebra of maximal length satisfying 𝒵⁢(P)=0 and H=∑α∈Λ([Pα,P-α]+Pα⁢P-α). Then

	
P=⨁[α]∈Λ⁣/∼I[α],
	

where any I[α] is a simple ideal having its root system ΛI[α] with all of its roots connected and satisfying [I[α],I[γ]]=I[α]⁢I[γ]=0 if [α]≠[γ].

Proof.

By Corollary 2.7,

	
P=⨁[α]∈Λ⁣/∼I[α]
	

is the direct sum of the ideals

	
I[α]=IH,[α]⊕V[α],
	

where

	
IH,[α]=s⁢p⁢a⁢n𝕂⁢{[Pβ,P-β]+Pβ⁢P-β:β∈[α]},
	

having any I[α] as root system ΛI[α]=[α]. In order to apply Theorem 3.5 to each I[α], observe that the fact ΛI[α]=[α] gives us easily that ΛI[α] has all of its elements connected through connections contained in ΛI[α]. We also have that any I[α] is root-multiplicative as consequence of the root-multiplicativity of P. Clearly I[α] is of maximal length because P is itself of maximal length, and finally 𝒵I[α]⁢(I[α])=0 (where 𝒵I[α]⁢(I[α]) denotes the center of I[α] in itself) as consequence of 𝒵⁢(P)=0 and [I[α],I[γ]]=I[α]⁢I[γ]=0 if [α]≠[γ] (Corollary 2.7). We can apply Theorem 3.5 to any I[α] which allows us to conclude I[α] is simple. It is clear that the decomposition P=⨁[α]∈Λ⁣/∼I[α] satisfies the assertions of the theorem, completing the proof. ∎",1484.17036.tex,1498.17008.tex,Insertions; Paraphrase; Variation of subject; Deletions; Different Presentation

We prove that P can be expressed as P=⊕j∈JIj with any Ij a non-zero ideal of P in such a way that satisfies [Ij1,Ij2]=Ij1∘Ij2=0 for j1≠j2, and under additional hypothesis these components of P are simple.

The paper is structured as follows. In this section we present some basic tools needed in the sequel. Section 2 introduces the connection techniques in the framework of Malcev-Poisson-Jordan algebras and it applies these techniques to study the structure of split Malcev-Poisson-Jordan algebras. Under certain conditions, in Section 3 it is shown that the previous result can be improved with a direct sum of simple components.",1484.17036.tex,1498.17008.tex,Variation of subject; Paraphrase; Different Presentation; Deletions

28 Y. AI.WADI, B. DGHEIM AND M. ROCZEN 1.1 Derinition. (E1,…,Em) is a good configuration of divisors if there exists a permutation π∈Sn such that all curves C=C(i),

	
C(i)=Eπ⁢(i)∩∑j=i+1mEπ⁢(j) (i=1,…,m-1),
	

satisfy the following condition: (*) The irreducible components C1,…,Cl of C can be enumerated in such a way that Cj intersects precisely one of the curves Cj+1,…,Cl (j=1,…,l-1).

Using this property, we obtain the Picard group of E=E1+…+Em in the following way (cf. [1]): 1.2. Proposition. Let Pic*⁡(E)⊆Pic⁡(E1)×…×Pic⁡(Em) be the set of all (L1,…,Lm),Li an invertible sheaf on Ei, such that Li|Ei∩Ej≃Lj|Ei∩Ej for all i,j. If (E1,…,Em) satisfies 1.1, then

we obtain an exact sequence

DIVISOR ClASS GROUPS OF SOME 3-DIMENSIONAL SINGULARITIES 29 Now denote by Cl⁢(A):=Cl⁢(Spec⁡(A)) the group of Weil divisors modulo linear equivalence. We compute Cl⁢(A) in terms of ℰ(= free abelian group generated by E1,…,Em),Pic(E) and the canonical homomorphism φ:ℰ→Pic⁡(E), sending Ei to 𝒪x⁢(Xi)∣E. 2.3. Remark. Denote by X∧ the completion of X along E. The canonical morphism X∧→X induces an isomorphism

(Apply Grothendieck’s ”Théorème d’existence” to the projective morphism X→Spec⁡(A). 2.4. Remark. Cl⁢(A)=Cl⁢(U)=Pic⁡(U), where U=X-E=Spec⁡(A)- -{mA}⋅(U is regular.) 2.5. Remark. The sequence (given by the canonical homomorphism Ei↦𝒪X⁢(Ei) and the restriction L↦L∣U) is exact.

Proof. β is surjective since the open subset U⊆X contains all points of codimension 1.α is injective since for any invertible sheaf L=𝒪X⁢(∑μi⁢Ei) with L≃𝒪X we find an element g in the quotient field of A having the divisor ∑μi⁢Ei.A is normal, i.e. if Supp⁡(g) is contained in the exceptional locus, Supp (g) must be empty, i.e. all μi=0. Now the exactness of the sequence is obvious. 2.6. THEOREM. There is an exact sequence

	
0→ℰ→φPic⁡(E)→Cl⁢(A)→0,
	

where φ denotes the above map. Proof. By [4], the canonical morphisins

	
Pic⁡(μ1⁢E1+…+μm⁢Em)→Pic⁡(E)
	

are isomorphisms if μ=(μ1,…,μm)∈𝐍m is such that μ1⁢E1+…+μm⁢Em has an ample conormal bundle and μ is ”symmetric”. Therefore, the completion gives an isomorphism τ:Pic⁡(X∧)→∼Pic⁡(E). Put φ=τ⁢O⁢ψ○α. Thus we obtain 2.6 from 2.4 and 2.5. 2.7. Corollary.

In [2], Bingener and Storch computed their divisor class groups in case of characteristic 0 . Here, we calculate these in the case of arbitrary characteristic p.

Let k be an algebraically closed field of characteristic p. Let f be one of the above equations, and A=k⁢[[X1,…,X4]]/(f). We use the same notations An,Dn or En, respectively. 2. Picard Groups of Divisors on 3-folds Let X be a smooth 3 -fold, and E1,…,En be proper divisors on X, all Ei being smooth, irreducible and having only normal crossings such that Ei1∩Ei2 is ∅ or a closed point (if ik≠iℓ for k≠ℓ ).

Definition 2.1. (E1,…,Em) is a good configuration of divisors if there exists a permutation π∈Sn such that all curves

	
C=C(i),C(i)=Eπ⁢(i)∩∑j=i+1mEπ⁢(j) (i=1,…,m-1),
	

satisfy the following condition: (*) The irreducible components C1,…,Cℓ of C can be enumerated in such a way that Cj intersects precisely one of the curves

	
Cj+1,…,Cℓ (j=1,…,ℓ-1).
	

Using this property, we obtain the Picard group of E=E1+⋯+Em in the following way (cf. [1]):

Proposition 2.2. Let Pic*⁡(E)⊆Pic⁡(E1)×⋯×Pic⁡(Em) be the set of all (L1,…,Lm),Li an invertible sheaf on Ei, such that Li∣Ei∩Ej≅ Lj∣Ei∩Ej for all i,j. If (E1,…,Em) satisfies (1.1), then

DIVISORS OF THE CANONICAL RESOLUTIONS … 277 Pic(E)→Pic*(E),L→(L|E1,…,L|Em), is bijective Proof. Put E¯=E2+⋯+Em. Using the exact sequence

	
1→OE1+E¯*→OE1*×OE¯*→OE1∩E¯*→1,
	

we obtain the following exact sequence

	
Ho⁢(OE1*)×H⁢(OE*)→Ho⁢(OE1∩E¯*)→∂Pic⁡(E)
→Pic⁡(E1)×Pic⁡(E¯)→Pic⁡(E1∩E¯)
	

with ∂ vanishing if E1∩E¯ is connected (e.g., if the curve E1∩E¯ satisfies (*) from (1.1)). Now, the result follows by induction. 3. Application to the Canonical Resolutions of An,Dn,En Let X→Spec⁡(A) be the canonical resolution of An,Dn, or En, obtained by successively blowing up closed points (cf. [5]). Denote by E=E1+⋯+Em its exceptional divisor. This is shown explicitly in [1]. Now, Pic⁡(E)≅Pic*⁡(E)⊆Zs as a subgroup by Proposition 2.2. Since Pic⁡(Ei) are all free abelian groups and the conditions Li∣Ei∩Ej≅ Lj∣Ei∩Ej can be expressed by linear equations (cf. [1]), we obtain: Corollary 3.1. Pic⁡(E) is a free abelian group, r⁢k⁢(Pic⁡(E))=[n+32] for An,r⁢k⁢(Pic⁡(E))=[3⁢n-12+2⁢(-1)n] for Dn,r⁢k⁢(Pic⁡(E))=5,11,12 for E6,E7,E8, respectively.

Now denote by C⁢l⁢(A):=C⁢l⁢(Spec⁡(A)) the group of Weil divisors modulo linear equivalences. We compute C⁢l⁢(A) in terms of ε (= free abelian group generated by E1,…,Em),Pic(E) and the canonical homomorphism

278 D. ALEXIOU and Y. ALWADI φ:ε→Pic⁡(E), sending Ei to Ox⁢(Xi)∣E. Remark 3.2. Denote the completion of X along E by X∧. Then the canonical morphism X∧→X induces an isomorphism

	
ψ:Pic⁡(X)→Pic⁡(X∧),L→L⊗OxOx∧
	

(apply Grothendieck’s ”Théoréme d’existence” to the projective morphism X→Spec(A)). Remark 3.3. C⁢l⁢(A)=C⁢l⁢(U)=Pic⁡(U), where

	
U=X-E=Spec⁡(A)-{mA},(U⁢ is regular ).
	

Remark 3.4. The sequence

	
0→ε→αPic⁡(X)→βPic⁡(U)→0
	

(given by the canonical homomorphism Ei→Ox⁢(Ei) and the restriction L→L∣U) is exact.

Proof. That β is surjective follows by noting that an open subset U⊆X contains all the points of codimension 1. That α is injective follows by noting that for any invertible sheaf L=Ox⁢(∑μi⁢Ei) with L≅Ox, we can find an element g in the quotient field of A having the divisor ∑μi⁢Ei, where A is normal. If Supp⁡(g) is contained in the exceptional locus, then Supp⁡(g) must be empty, i.e., all μi=0. Now, the exactness of the sequence follows. Theorem 3.5. The following is an exact sequence

	
0→ε→φPic⁡(E)→C⁢l⁢(A)→0,
	

where φ is the map as defined above. Proof. By [4], the canonical morphisms

	
Pic⁡(μ1⁢E1+⋯+μm⁢Em)→Pic⁡(E)
	




DIVISORS OF THE CANONICAL RESOLUTIONS … 279 are isomorphisms if μ=(μ1,…,μm)∈Nm is such that μ1⁢E1+⋯+μm⁢Em has an ample conormal bundle and μ is ”symmetric”. Therefore, the completion gives an isomorphism τ:Pic⁡(X∧)→∼Pic⁡(E). Put φ=τ∘ψ∘α. Thus we obtain Corollary 3.6 from Remark 3.4 and Theorem 3.5. Corollary 3.6.

"Proof. By Proposition 1.7, it suffices to construct Ding 𝒫⁢𝒫C-⁢-resolutions of ⁢C and R. By definition, C admits an augmented degreewise finite free resolution

	
X=⋯→Rα1→Rα0→C→0
	

definition and C≅Coker⁡(Rα1→Rα0). Furthermore, since ExtR⩾1⁡(C,C)=0, the complex HomR⁡(X,C⊗RF) is exact for any flat R-module F by [19, Lem. 1.11(b)]. Thus, C is DC-projective. Now, we show that

	
HomR⁡(X,C)=0→R→Cα0→Cα1→⋯
	

is a Ding 𝒫⁢𝒫C-resolution of R. First, left exactness of HomR⁡(-,C) and the equality ExtR⩾1⁡(C,C)=0 imply HomR⁡(X,C) is exact. Moreover, since HomR⁡(X,C) consists of finitely presented modules, for any flat R-module F, tensor evaluation provides the first isomorphism of complexes HomR⁡(HomR⁡(X,C),C⊗RF)≅HomR⁡(HomR⁡(X,C),C)⊗RF≅X⊗RF. The second isomorphism follows from the fact that HomR⁡(C,C)≅R and [1, Prop. 20.11]. These complexes are exact since the complex X is exact and F is flat.

Finally, since the class 𝒟⁢𝒫C⁢(R) contains the class 𝒫⁢(R), every R-module admits a DC-projective resolution.","Proof. (1) Since C is semidualizing, there is an exact sequence of the form: 𝐗=⋯→Rn1→Rn0→C→0 with all ni being positive integer numbers. By [18, Lemma 1.11 (b)], HomR⁡(𝐗,C⊗RQ) is exact for any flat R-module Q. On the other hand, there is an exact sequence of the form:

	
𝐘=0⟶0C⟶1C⟶0C⟶1⋯.
	

By tensor evaluation homomorphism; see [2, p. 11],

	
HomR⁡(𝐘,C⊗RQ)≅HomR⁡(𝐘,C)⊗RQ≅𝐐
	

is exact, where 𝐐 is the following exact sequence

	
⋯⟶0Q⟶1Q⟶0Q⟶00.
	

Therefore, C is DC-projective. It is clear that the complex HomR⁡(𝐗,C)=0→R→Cn0→Cn1→⋯ is exact. Since R and all Cni are finitely generated, for any flat R-module F,

	
HomR⁡(HR⁢(𝐗,C),C⊗RF)≅HomR⁡(HomR⁡(𝐗,C),C)⊗RF≅𝐗⊗RF
	

is exact. Thus R is DC-projective. (2) By Lemma 2.6 and (1), for any projective P,P and C⊗RP are DC- projective.",1333.16013.tex,1461.16006.tex,Paraphrase; Different Presentation; Deletions; Insertions
"Recall that a class of modules is called projectively resolving if it is closed under extensions, kernels of surjections and it contains all projective modules. Theorem 1.12. The class 𝒟⁢𝒫C⁢(R) is projectively resolving and closed under direct summands.

Proof. By Propositions 1.8 and 1.10, it suffices to show that the class 𝒟⁢𝒫C⁢(R) is closed under kernels of surjections. Consider an exact sequence of R-modules 0→M′→M→M′′→0 with M,M′′∈𝒟⁢𝒫C⁢(R). Let P and P′′ be Ding 𝒫⁢𝒫C-resolutions of M and M′′, respectively. ”Comparison Lemma” for resolutions (see [12, Prop. 1.8] and [17, Prop. 6.9]) provides a morphism of chain complexes φ:P→P′′ inducing M→M′′ on the degree 0 cokernels. By adding complexes of the form 0→Pi′′⟶i⁢dPi′′→0 for i⩾0 and 0→ C⊗RPi′′→i⁢dC⊗RPi′′→0 for i<0 to P, one can assume φ is surjective. Since both the class 𝒫⁢(R) and 𝒫C⁢(R) are closed under kernels of epimorphisms, see [13, Cor. 6.4], the complex P′=Ker⁡(φ) has the form

	
P′=⋯→P1′→P0′→C⊗RP-1′→C⊗RP-2′→⋯
	

with Pi′∈𝒫⁢(R) for any i∈ℤ. The exact sequence 0→P′→P→P′′→0 is degreewise split by Lemma 1.9. So an argument similar to that of the previous Proposition 1.10 implies that P′ is a Ding 𝒫⁢𝒫C-⁢-resolution  and M′ is DC- projective.

Since the class 𝒟⁢𝒫C⁢(R) is projectively resolving and closed under arbitrary direct sums by Proposition 1.11, it follows from Eilenberg’s swindle [12, 1.4] that it is also closed under direct summands.","It is easy to prove the following two results using standard arguments.

By induction, one has ExtR⩾1⁡(Ni,C⊗RF)=0. Proposition 1.8 implies that C⊗RPi∈𝒟⁢𝒫C⁢(R) for each i⩽-1, so ExtR⩾1⁡(C⊗RPi,C⊗RF)=0. The long exact sequence in HomR⁡(-,C⊗RF) associated to Yi provides ExtR⩾2(Ni-1,C⊗R F)=0. Furthermore, since HomR⁡(X,C⊗RF) is exact, so is the complex HomR⁡(Yi,C⊗RF). Since ExtR1⁡(C⊗RPi,C⊗RF)=0, we have ExtR1(Ni-1,C⊗R F)=0 by ”Five Lemma”.

Corollary 1.14. An R-module M∈𝒟C⁢(R) if and only if there exists an exact sequence of R-modules 0→M→C⊗RP→N→0 such that P∈𝒫⁢(R) and N∈𝒟C⁢(R). Proof. Just use Proposition 1.8, Theorem 1.12 and Proposition 1.13. Holm proved in [12] that if 0→M→N→L→0 is a short exact sequence of R-modules with M,N∈𝒢⁢𝒫⁢(R), then L∈𝒢⁢𝒫⁢(R) if and only if ExtR1⁡(L,P)=0 for all projective R-modules P. Using the same methods, Mahdou and Tamekkante in [15] have proved the similar result holds for Ding projective modules. In the following, we will give a new proof to DC-projective modules.

Corollary 1.15. Let 0→M→N→L→0 be a short exact sequence of R modules. If M,N∈𝒟C⁢(R), then L∈𝒟𝒫⁢(R) if and only if ExtR1(L,C⊗R F)=0 for all flat R-modules F.

Proof. The necessity follows from Proposition 1.4. We now prove the sufficiency. Let

	
0→M→fN→gL→0
	

be a short exact sequence of R-modules with M,N∈𝒟C⁢(R), and ExtR1(L, C⊗RF)=0 for all flat R-modules F. Then there exist HomR⁡(-,ℱC⁢(R))-exact exact sequences of R-modules

	
𝒳=: 0→M→C⊗RP0→C⊗RP1→⋯
𝒴=: 0→N→C⊗RQ0→C⊗RQ1→⋯
	

with Pi,Qi∈𝒫⁢(R) for i⩾0. So the homomorphism f:M→N can be lifted to a chain map α:𝒳→𝒴 and the mapping cone 𝒟 of α:𝒳→𝒴 is exact by [7, Prop. 1.4.14]. Also, the sequence 𝒟 of R-modules is HomR⁡(-,ℱC⁢(R))-exact since both 𝒳 and 𝒴 are so. Consider the following commutative diagram:

DING PROJECTIVE MODULES 347 where K=Coker⁡(M→N⊕(C⊗RP0)). Since the sequence 𝒟 is HomR⁡(-,ℱC⁢(R))-exact, breaking 𝒟 into short exact ones, we have that the sequence 0→M→N⊕(C⊗RP0)→K is also HomR⁡(-,ℱC⁢(R))-exact. Clearly, the sequence

	
0→𝒲→𝒟→𝒵→0
	

is exact. Since both 𝒲 and 𝒟 are exact, that 𝒵 is exact. Moreover, 𝒵 is HomR⁡(-,ℱC⁢(R))-exact since both 𝒲 and 𝒟 are so.

It is straightforward to see that there exists a homomorphism h:K→L such that the following diagram commutes: where π:N⊕(C⊗RP0)→N is the canonical projection. By ”Five Lemma”, we get that h is an epimorphism. By ”Snake Lemma”, we have Ker⁡(h)≅ Ker⁡(π)=C⊗RP0. Thus the sequence of R-modules

	
0→C⊗RP0→K→hL→0
	

is exact. Moreover, this short exact sequence splits by assumption that ExtR1⁡(L,C⊗RP0)=0. Hence K≅L⊕(C⊗RP0). On the other hand, one can check that ExtRi⁡(L,C⊗RF)=0 for all flat R-modules F and all i⩾1, and so ExtRi⁡(K,C⊗RF)≅Exti⁡(L⊕(C⊗RP0),C⊗RF)=0 for all flat R-modules F and all i⩾1, thus the projective resolution

	
𝒦=⋯→P1→P0→K→0
	

of K is HomR(-,ℱC(R) )-exact. Assembling the sequences 𝒦 and 𝒵, we get the Ding 𝒫⁢𝒫C-resolution of K, and so K≅L⊕(C⊗RP0) is DC-projective. Then, L is DC-projective by Theorem 1.12, as desired. 2.

They play an important role in physics and stochastic processes (see, e.g., [13,24,27] ). In particular, the Dunkl harmonic oscillators on ℝn were studied in [11,19,20,23]. We will consider only this operator on ℝ, where it is uniquely determined by one parameter. In this case, a conjugation of the Dunkl operator was previously introduced by Yang [28] (see also [21]).

Let us fix some notation that is used in the whole paper. Let 𝒮=𝒮⁢(ℝ) be the Schwartz space on ℝ, with its Fréchet topology. It decomposes as direct sum of subspaces of even and odd functions, 𝒮=𝒮ev⊕𝒮odd . The even/odd component of a function in 𝒮 is denoted with the subindex ev/odd. Since 𝒮odd =x⁢𝒮ev , where x is the standard coordinate of ℝ,x-1⁢ϕ∈𝒮ev is defined for ϕ∈𝒮odd . Let Lσ2=L2⁢(ℝ,|x|2⁢σ⁢d⁢x)⁢(σ∈ℝ), whose scalar product and norm are denoted by ⟨,⟩σ and ∥∥σ. The above decomposition of 𝒮 extends to an orthogonal decomposition, Lσ2=Lσ, ev 2⊕Lσ, odd 2, because the function |x|2⁢σ is even. 𝒮 is a dense subspace of Lσ2 if σ>-12, and 𝒮odd  is a dense subspace of Lτ, odd 2 if τ>-32. Unless otherwise stated, we assume σ>-12 and τ>-32. The domain of a (densely defined) operator P in a Hilbert space is denoted by D⁢(P). If P is closable, its closure is denoted by P¯. The domain of a (densely defined) sesquilinear form 𝔭 in a Hilbert space is denoted by D⁢(𝔭). The quadratic form of 𝔭 is also denoted by 𝔭. If 𝔭 is closable, its closure is denoted by 𝔭¯. For an operator in Lσ2 preserving the above decomposition, its restrictions to Lσ, ev/odd 2 will be indicated with the subindex ev/odd. The

2 J.A. Álvarez López, M. Calaza and C. Franco operator of multiplication by a continuous function h in Lσ2 is also denoted by h. The harmonic oscillator is the operator H=-d2d⁢x2+s2⁢x2⁢(s>0) in L02 with D⁢(H)=𝒮.

The Dunkl operator on ℝ is the operator T in Lσ2, with D⁢(T)=𝒮, determined by T=dd⁢x on 𝒮ev  and T=dd⁢x+2⁢σ⁢x-1 on 𝒮odd , and the Dunkl harmonic oscillator on ℝ is the operator J=-T2+s2⁢x2 in Lσ2 with D⁢(J)=𝒮. Thus J preserves the above decomposition of 𝒮, being Jev=H-2⁢σ⁢x-1⁢dd⁢x and Jodd =H-2⁢σ⁢dd⁢x⁢x-1. The subindex σ is added to J if needed. This J is essentially self-adjoint, and the spectrum of J¯ is well known [23]; in particular, J¯>0. In fact, even for τ>-32, the operator Jτ, odd  is defined in Lτ, odd 2 with D⁢(Jτ, odd )=𝒮odd  because it is a conjugation of Jτ+1, ev  by a unitary operator (Section 2). Some operators of the form J+ξ⁢x-2 (ξ∈ℝ) are conjugates of J by powers |x|a⁢(a∈ℝ), and therefore their study can be reduced to the case of J [3].

"First, we express the curvature of a geodesic curve through V and γ˙ :

LEMMA 2.1. The Riemannian geodesic curvature κ of a - geodesic γ is given by κ2=∥V∥2-g⁢(V,γ˙)2/E2 for general V, and by κ2=-E-2⁢d/d⁢t⁢g⁢(V,γ˙) if V is a Killing vector field.

Proof. Observe that γ¨=∇γ˙g⁡γ˙, and κ=∥γ¨∥/E2 in our normalization. Differentiating the geodesic Equation (1) once more and taking the scalar product with γ˙, we obtain

	
g⁢(γ˙˙˙,γ˙)=E2⁢g⁢(V,γ¨)=E2⁢[g⁢(V,γ˙)2-E2⁢∥V∥2].
	

But from g⁢(γ˙,γ¨)=0, we conclude that g⁢(γ¨,γ¨)+g⁢(γ˙,γ¨)=0, hence the first claim follows. Suppose now that V is a Killing vector field, g⁢(∇Xg⁡V,Y)+g⁢(∇Yg⁡V,X)=0 for all X and Y. This implies in particular g⁢(γ˙,V˙)=g⁢(γ˙,∇γ˙g⁡V)=0, and so

γ˙˙˙=g⁢(V˙,γ˙)⁢γ˙+g⁢(V,γ¨)⁢γ˙+g⁢(V,γ˙)⁢γ¨
	

Then by taking the scalar product of the geodesic equation above with γ˙ we get

Because of g⁢(γ˙,γ¨)=0, we find g⁢(γ¨,γ¨)+g⁢(γ˙,γ˙˙˙)=0. Thus, using the equation κ=∥γ˙∥E2=|g⁢(γ¨,γ˙)|E2, we obtain

	
κ=g⁢(V,γ˙)E.
	

Let V be a Killing vector field. Then,

". Basic Remarks on Geodesics of Metric Connections with Vectorial Torsion Let (M,g) be a Riemannian manifold, V a vector field on M and ∇ the metric connection with vectorial torsion defined by V. A curve γ⁢(t) is a geodesic of ∇ if it satisfies the differential equation

	
∇γ˙g⁡γ˙+g⁢(γ˙,γ˙)⁢V-g⁢(V,γ˙)⁢γ˙=0.
	

Taking the scalar product of this equation with γ˙ yields g⁢(∇γ˙g⁡γ˙,γ˙)=0, that is, γ˙ has constant length E>0, which reflects of course just the fact that ∇ was metric. Hence, the geodesic equation can be written

	
∇γ˙g⁡γ˙+E2⁢V-g⁢(V,γ˙)⁢γ˙=0.
	

In fact, there are qualitatively two cases to be distinguished. If γ˙ is parallel to V at the origin, γ˙⁢(0)=α⋅V⁢(γ⁢(0)), we conclude that ∇γ˙⁢(0)g⁡γ˙⁢(0)=0 and γ⁢(t) coincides locally with a classical geodesic of the Levi-Civita connection. In particular, a ∇-geodesic which stays parallel to V for all times is exactly a ∇g-geodesic. Generic ∇-geodesics are those for which γ˙ is never parallel to V; their shape will be qualitatively very different from that of their Levi-Civita ’cousins’.","2. On Geodesics of Non-Metric Connections with Vectorial Torsion Suppose that (M,g) is a Riemannian manifold, and ∇ is the non-metric connection with vectorial torsion denoted by V. If there exists differential equation satisfying

	
∇~⁢γ˙-g⁢(V,γ˙)⁢γ˙=0.
	

for any vector field V of M, then a curve γ is called a geodesic of ∇. After taking the inner product of each side of (2.1) with γ˙, we find g⁢(∇~⁢γ˙,γ˙)=-λ⁢E4. Thus, it is obvious that γ˙ has constant length g⁢(γ˙,γ˙)=E2 for spacelike curve, where E is a positive constant and V=λ⁢γ˙. Therefore, for spacelike curve we can obtain the geodesic equation given by

	
∇~⁢γ˙=-λ⁢E2⁢γ˙
	

From (2.2), we have two cases for curves: i) If γ˙ is parallel to V at the origin, γ˙⁢(0)=α⁢V⁢(γ⁢(0)), then we conclude from Equation (2.2) that ∇~⁢γ˙⁢(0)=-α2⁢g⁢(V⁢(γ⁢(0)),V⁢(γ⁢(0)))⁢V⁢(γ⁢(0)) and γ is not correlation with a classical geodesic of the Riemannian connection.

for the function τ. Now, if σ⁢(t)=(σ∘γ∘τ)⁢(t) is defined and τ˙ viewed as a function on γ⁢(I)⊂M, it can not be solved directly since σ depends implicitly on τ.

"2. Basic Remarks on Geodesics of Metric Connections with Vectorial Torsion Let (M,g) be a Riemannian manifold, V a vector field on M and ∇ the metric connection with vectorial torsion defined by V. A curve γ⁢(t) is a geodesic of ∇ if it satisfies the differential equation

	
∇γ˙g⁡γ˙+g⁢(γ˙,γ˙)⁢V-g⁢(V,γ˙)⁢γ˙=0.
	

Taking the scalar product of this equation with γ˙ yields g⁢(∇γ˙g⁡γ˙,γ˙)=0, that is, γ˙ has constant length E>0, which reflects of course just the fact that ∇ was metric. Hence, the geodesic equation can be written

	
∇γ˙g⁡γ˙+E2⁢V-g⁢(V,γ˙)⁢γ˙=0.
	

In fact, there are qualitatively two cases to be distinguished. If γ˙ is parallel to V at the origin, γ˙⁢(0)=α⋅V⁢(γ⁢(0)), we conclude that ∇γ˙⁢(0)g⁡γ˙⁢(0)=0 and γ⁢(t) coincides locally with a classical geodesic of the Levi-Civita connection. In particular, a ∇-geodesic which stays parallel to V for all times is exactly a ∇g-geodesic. Generic ∇-geodesics are those for which γ˙ is never parallel to V; their shape will be qualitatively very different from that of their Levi-Civita ’cousins’. First, we express the curvature of a geodesic curve through V and γ˙ :

LEMMA 2.1. The Riemannian geodesic curvature κ of a - geodesic γ is given by κ2=∥V∥2-g⁢(V,γ˙)2/E2 for general V, and by κ2=-E-2⁢d/d⁢t⁢g⁢(V,γ˙) if V is a Killing vector field.

Proof. Observe that γ¨=∇γ˙g⁡γ˙, and κ=∥γ¨∥/E2 in our normalization. Differentiating the geodesic Equation (1) once more and taking the scalar product with γ˙, we obtain

	
g⁢(γ˙˙˙,γ˙)=E2⁢g⁢(V,γ¨)=E2⁢[g⁢(V,γ˙)2-E2⁢∥V∥2].
	

But from g⁢(γ˙,γ¨)=0, we conclude that g⁢(γ¨,γ¨)+g⁢(γ˙,γ¨)=0, hence the first claim follows. Suppose now that V is a Killing vector field, g⁢(∇Xg⁡V,Y)+g⁢(∇Yg⁡V,X)=0 for all X and Y. This implies in particular g⁢(γ˙,V˙)=g⁢(γ˙,∇γ˙g⁡V)=0, and so

	
dd⁢t⁢g⁢(V,γ˙)=g⁢(V,γ¨)=g⁢(V,γ˙)2-E2⁢∥V∥2=-E2⁢κ2.
	

I",". On Geodesics of Metric Connections with Vectorial Torsion Let (M,g) be a semi-Riemannian manifold, a vector field V on M and the metric connection D with vectorial torsion defined by V. A curve γ is a geodesic of D if it satisfies the differential equation

	
Dγ˙g⁢γ˙+g⁢(γ˙,γ˙)⁢V-g⁢(V,γ˙)⁢γ˙=0⁢. 
	

If we take the scalar product of this equation with γ˙, we get g⁢(Dγ˙g⁢γ˙,γ˙)=0. Then, for timelike and spacelike curves, γ˙ has constant length g⁢(γ˙,γ˙)=ε⁢E2, where E is a positive constant and the signature ε is ±1. If γ is a null curve, then γ˙ has zero length. Hence, the geodesic equation for null curves can be written as

	
Dγ˙g⁢γ˙=g⁢(V,γ˙)⁢γ˙,
	

and the geodesic equation for timelike and spacelike curves can be written

	
Dγ˙g⁢γ˙+ε⁢E2⁢V-g⁢(V,γ˙)⁢γ˙=0.
	

Here, there are two cases to be distinguished for timelike and spacelike curves. i) If γ˙ is parallel to V at the origin, which means γ˙⁢(0)=α⁢V⁢(γ⁢(0)), then we have Dγ˙⁢(0)g⁢γ˙⁢(0)=0 from Equation (2.3) and γ coincides locally with a classical geodesic of the Levi-Civita connection. In particular, a D-geodesic which stays parallel to V for all times is exactly a Dg-geodesic. ii) Generic D-geodesics are those for which γ˙ is never parallel to V; their shape will be very different from that of the Levi-Civita connection. Now, we express the curvature of a geodesic curve through V and γ˙. Lemma 2.1. The geodesic curvature κ of a D-geodesic γ, which is non-null curve, is given by

	
κ2=E2⁢|ε*⁢E2⁢∥V∥2-ε⁢g⁢(V,γ˙)2|
	

for general V, and by

	
κ2=E2⁢|dd⁢t⁢g⁢(V,γ˙)|
	

if V is a Killing vector field, where ε* is the signature of V.

THE GEODESICS OF METRIC CONNECTIONS WITH VECTORIAL TORSION 3 Proof. We observe that γ¨=Dγ˙g⁢γ˙, and κ=∥γ¨∥. We get

	
γ˙˙˙=g⁢(V˙,γ˙)⁢γ˙+g⁢(V,γ¨)⁢γ˙+g⁢(V,γ˙)⁢γ¨-ε⁢E2⁢V
	

differentiating geodesic equation (2.3), and

	
g⁢(γ˙˙˙,γ˙)=E2⁢[ε⁢g⁢(V,γ˙)2-ε*⁢E2⁢∥V∥2].
	

taking the scalar product with γ˙. Since g⁢(γ˙,γ¨)=0, we obtain g⁢(γ¨,γ¨)+g⁢(γ˙,γ˙˙˙)=0. Hence, from κ=∥γ¨∥=|g⁢(γ¨,γ¨)|, we have

	
κ2=E2⁢|ε*⁢E2⁢∥V∥2-ε⁢g⁢(V,γ˙)2|.
	

Now, assume that V is a Killing vector field. Then,

	
g⁢(DXg⁢V,Y)+g⁢(DYg⁢V,X)=0
	

for all X and Y. This means that g⁢(γ˙,V˙)=g⁢(γ˙,Dγ˙g⁢V)=0, and so

	dd⁢t⁢g⁢(V,γ˙)	=g⁢(V,γ¨)=g⁢(V,g⁢(V,γ˙)⁢γ˙-ε⁢E2⁢V)	
		=-ε⁢{ε*⁢E2⁢∥V∥2-ε⁢g⁢(V,γ˙)2}	

Hence, we have

Semi-Symmetric Metric Connection

Let M~ be an (n+1)-dimensional, n>1, differentiable manifold of class C∞ and ∇~ a lineer connection in M~. Then the torsion tensor T~ of ∇~ is given by

	
T~⁢(X~,Y~)=∇~X~⁢Y~-∇~Y~⁢X~-[X~,Y~],∀X~,Y~∈Γ⁢(T⁢M~)
	

and is of type (1,2). When the torsion tensor T~ satisfies

	
T~⁢(X~,Y~)=π~⁢(Y~)⁢X~-π~⁢(X~)⁢Y~
	

for a 1- form π~, the connection ∇~ is said to be semi-symmetric, see [13].

Let there be given a semi-Riemannian metric g~ of index ν with 1≤ν≤n in M~ and ∇~ satisfy

	
∇~⁢g~=0,
	

then such a lineer connection is called a metric connection, see [12].

We now suppose that the semi-Riemannian manifold M~ admits a semisymmetric metric connection given by

	
∇~X~Y~=∇~∘X~Y~+π~(Y~)X~-g~(X~,Y~)Q~
	

for arbitrary vector fields X~ and Y~ of M~, where ∇~∘ denotes the Levi-Civita connection with respect to the semi-Riemannian metric g~,π~ is a 1 -form and Q~ is the vector field defined by

	
g~⁢(Q~,X~)=π~⁢(X~)
	

for an arbitrary vector field X~ of M~. From (2.4), we can write

	
Q~=ϕ⁢Q+μ⁢N,
	

where Q is a vector field and μ is a function in M.

Denoting by ∇∘ the symmetric linear connection induced on the lightlike

	
∇ϕ⁢X∘ϕY=ϕ(∇X∘Y)+B(X,Y)N
	

for arbitrary vector fields X and Y of M, where B is the local second fundamental form of M. Denoting by ∇ the connection induced on the lightlike hypersurface from ∇~ the semi-symmetric metric connection, we have

	
∇~ϕ⁢X⁢ϕ⁢Y=ϕ⁢(∇X⁡Y)+m⁢(X,Y)⁢N
	

for arbitrary vector fields X and Y of M, where m is a tensor of type (0,2) of the lightlike hypersurface of M and we call (3.4) the equations of Gauss with respect to the induced connection ∇.

From (3.1), we obtain

	
∇~ϕ⁢XϕY=∇~ϕ⁢X∘ϕY+π~(ϕY)ϕX-g~(ϕX,ϕY)Q~,
	

and hence, using (3.3) and (3.4), we can also write

	ϕ(∇XY)+m(X,Y)N=ϕ(∇X∘Y)+B(	X,Y)N	
		+π~⁢(ϕ⁢Y)⁢ϕ⁢X-g~⁢(ϕ⁢X,ϕ⁢Y)⁢Q~	

Substituting (3.2) into (3.5), we get

	ϕ⁢(∇X⁡Y)	+m⁢(X,Y)⁢N	
		=ϕ(∇X∘Y+π(Y)X-g(X,Y)Q)+{B(X,Y)-μg(X,Y)}N,	

from this equation, we have

	
∇XY=∇X∘Y+π(Y)X-g(X,Y)Q,
	

where π⁢(X)=π~⁢(ϕ⁢X) and

	
m⁢(X,Y)=B⁢(X,Y)-μ⁢g⁢(X,Y).
	

D","3 Semi-Symmetric Non-Metric Connection

Let M~ be an (n+1)-dimensional, n>1, differentiable manifold of class C∞ and ∇~ a linear connection in M~. If the torsion tensor T~ of ∇~ defined by

	
T~⁢(X~,Y~)=∇~X~⁢Y~-∇~Y~⁢X~-[X~,Y~],∀X~,Y~∈Γ⁢(T⁢M~)
	

satisfies

	
T~⁢(X~,Y~)=π~⁢(Y~)⁢X~-π~⁢(X~)⁢Y~
	

for a 1-form π~, then the connection ∇~ is said to be semi-symmetric ([1] and [13]).

Let a semi-Riemannian metric g~ of index v with 1≤v≤n in M~ be given and ∇~ satisfy

	
(∇~⁢X~⁢g~)⁢(Y~,Z~)=-π~⁢(Y~)⁢g~⁢(X~,Z~)-π~⁢(Z~)⁢g~⁢(X~,Y~),
	

then such a linear connection is called a non-metric connection [1].

We now suppose that the semi-Riemannian manifold M~ admits a semisymmetric non-metric connection given by

	
∇~X~Y~=∇~X~∘Y~+π~(Y~)X~
	

nection with respect to the semi-Riemannian metric g~,π~ is a 1-form associated with the vector field Q~ on M~ by

	
π~⁢(X~)=g~⁢(X~,Q~)
	

(see [1] and [6]).

By using the second form of the decomposition (4), we can write

	
Q~=ϕ⁢Q+μ⁢N
	

where Q is a vector field and μ is a function in M.

We know that the Gauss formula with respect to ∇∘ the symmetric linear

	
∇~ϕ⁢X∘ϕY=ϕ(∇X∘Y)+B(X,Y)N
	

for any X,Y∈Γ⁢(T⁢M), where B is the second fundamental form of M [5]. Denoting by ∇ the connection induced on the lightlike hypersurface from ∇~, LIGHTLIKE HYPERSURFACES IN SEMI-RIEMANNIAN MANIFOLD WITH . . 257

we have

	
∇~ϕ⁢X⁢ϕ⁢Y=ϕ⁢(∇X⁡Y)+m⁢(X,Y)⁢N,
	

where m is a tensor of type (0,2) of the lightlike hypersurface of M and we call (8) the Gauss formula with respect to the induced connection ∇.

In view of (5), we find

	
∇~ϕ⁢XϕY=∇~ϕ⁢X∘ϕY+π~(ϕY)ϕX,
	

and therefore, using (7) and (8), we can also write

	ϕ⁢(∇X⁡Y)+m⁢(X,Y)⁢N=	(∇X∘Y)+B(X,Y)N	
		+π~⁢(ϕ⁢Y)⁢ϕ⁢X	

Substituting (6) into (9), we obtain

	
ϕ(∇XY)+m(X,Y)N=ϕ(∇X∘Y+π(Y)X)+B(X,Y)N

∇XY=∇X∘Y+π(Y)X

Now, we shall find the equations of Gauss and Codazzi of lightlike hypersurface with a semi-symmetric non-metric connection. The curvature tensor of the semi-symmetric non-metric connection ∇~ of M~ is, by definition,

	
R~⁢(X~,Y~)⁢Z~=∇~X~⁢∇~Y~⁢Z~-∇~Y~⁢∇~X~⁢Z~-∇~[X~,Y~]⁢Z~
	

Putting X~=ϕ⁢X,Y~=ϕ⁢Y,Z~=ϕ⁢Z, we get

Thus, using (8) and (16), we find

where R⁢(X,Y)⁢Z=∇X⁡∇Y⁡Z-∇Y⁡∇X⁡Z-∇[X,Y]⁡Z is the curvature tensor of a lightlike hypersurface with a semi-symmetric non-metric connection ∇.

Hayden (1932) introduced a semi-symmetric metric connection on a Riemannian manifold. Yano (1970) proved the theorem: In order that a Riemannian manifold admits a semi-symmetric metric connection whose curvature tensor vanishes, it is necessary and sufficient that the Riemannian manifold be conformally flat. Some topics related to this theorem were studied by Imai (1972a). Imai (1972b) gave basic properties of a hypersurface of a Riemannian manifold with a semi-symmetric metric connection and got conformal equations of Gauss and Codazzi.

"3 Preliminaries

Let M be a hypersurface of a (n+1)-dimensional, n>1, semi-Riemannian manifold M~ with semi-Riemannian metric g~ of index 1≤ν≤n. We consider

	
Tx⁢M⟂={Yx∈Tx⁢M~∣g~x⁢(Yx,Xx)=0,∀Xx∈Tx⁢M}
	

for any x∈M. Then we say that M is a lightlike (null, degenerate) hypersurface of M~ or equivalently, the immersion

	
i:M→M~
	

of M in M~ is lightlike (null, degenerate) if Tx⁢M∩Tx⁢M⟂≠{0} at any x∈ M. Henceforth we identify i⁢(M) with M and we denote the differentional d⁢i, immersing a vector field X in M to a vector field ϕ⁢X in M~, by ϕ. Thus the induced metric tensor g=g~|M is defined by

	
g⁢(X,Y)=g~⁢(ϕ⁢X,ϕ⁢Y),∀X,Y∈Γ⁢(T⁢M).
	

An orthogonal complementary vector bundle of T⁢M⟂ in T⁢M is non-degenerate subbundle of T⁢M called the screen distribution on M and denoted S⁢(T⁢M). We have the following splitting into orthogonal direct sum:

	
T⁢M=S⁢(T⁢M)⟂T⁢M⟂.
	

The subbundle S⁢(T⁢M) is non-degenerate, so is S⁢(T⁢M)⟂, and the following holds:

	
T⁢M~=S⁢(T⁢M)⟂S⁢(T⁢M)⟂,
	

where S⁢(T⁢M)⟂ is the orthogonal complementary vector bundle to S⁢(T⁢M) in T⁢M~|M

Let tr⁡(T⁢M) denote the complementary vector bundle of T⁢M⟂ in S⁢(T⁢M)⟂. Then we have

	
S⁢(T⁢M)⟂=T⁢M⟂⊕tr⁡(T⁢M).
	

Let U be a coordinate neighborhood in M and ξ be a basis of Γ⁢(T⁢M⟂|U). Then there exists a basis N of tr⁡(T⁢M)|U satisfying the following conditions:

	
g~⁢(N,ξ)=1,
	

and

	
g~⁢(N,N)=g~⁢(W,ξ)=0,∀W∈Γ⁢(S⁢(T⁢M)|U).
	

The subbundle tr⁡(T⁢M) is called a lightlike transversal vector bundle of M. We note that tr⁡(T⁢M) is never orthogonal to T⁢M. From (2.1), (2.2) and (2.3) we have

	
T⁢M~|M=S⁢(T⁢M)⟂(T⁢M⟂⊕tr⁡(T⁢M))=T⁢M⊕tr⁡(T⁢M)⁢[2].
	","2 PRELIMINARIES

Let M be a hypersurface of an (n+1)-dimensional, n>1, semi-Riemannian manifold M~ with semi-Riemannian metric g~ of index 1≤ν≤n. We consider:

	
Tx⟂⁢M={Yx∈Tx⁢M~∣g~x⁢(Yx,Xx)=0,∀Xx∈Tx⁢M}
	

for any x∈M. Then we say that M is a lightlike (null, degenerate) hypersurface of M~ or equivalently, the immersion

	
i:M→M~
	

of M in M~ is lightlike (null, degenerate) if Tx⁢M∩Tx⁢M⟂≠{0} at any point x∈M. Henceforth we identify i⁢(M) with M and we denote the differential d⁢i, immersing a vector field X on M to a vector field ϕ⁢X on M~ by ϕ. Thus the induced metric tensor g=g~|M is defined by:

	
g⁢(X,Y)=g~⁢(ϕ⁢X,ϕ⁢Y),∀X,Y∈Γ⁢(T⁢M).
	

An orthogonal complementary vector bundle of T⁢M⟂ in T⁢M is nondegenerate subbundle of T⁢M which is called the screen distribution on M and denoted by S⁢(T⁢M). We have the following splitting into an orthogonal direct sum:

	
T⁢M=S⁢(T⁢M)⟂T⁢M⟂.
	

The subbundle S⁢(T⁢M) is non-degenerate, so is S⁢(T⁢M)⟂, and the following holds:

	
T⁢M~=S⁢(T⁢M)⟂S⁢(T⁢M)⟂,
	

where S⁢(T⁢M)⟂ is the orthogonal complementary vector bundle to S⁢(T⁢M) in T⁢M~|M

Let tr⁡(T⁢M) denote a complementary vector bundle of T⁢M⟂ in S⁢(T⁢M)⟂. Then we have:

	
S⁢(T⁢M)⟂=T⁢M⟂⊕tr⁡(T⁢M).
	

Let U be a coordinate neighborhood in M and ξ be a basis of Γ⁢(T⁢M⟂|U). Then there exists a basis N of tr⁡(T⁢M)|U satisfying the following conditions:

	
g~⁢(N,ξ)=1⁢, and ⁢g~⁢(N,N)=g~⁢(W,N)=0,∀W∈Γ⁢(S⁢(T⁢M)|U).
	

The subbundle tr⁡(T⁢M) is called a lightlike transversal vector bundle of M. We note that tr⁡(T⁢M) is never orthogonal to T⁢M. From (1), (2) and (3) we have:

	
T⁢M~|M=S⁢(T⁢M)⟂(T⁢M⟂⊕tr⁡(T⁢M))=T⁢M⊕tr⁡(T⁢M)

"4 Semi-Symmetric Metric Connection

Let M~ be an (n+1)-dimensional, n>1, differentiable manifold of class C∞ and ∇~ a lineer connection in M~. Then the torsion tensor T~ of ∇~ is given by

	
T~⁢(X~,Y~)=∇~X~⁢Y~-∇~Y~⁢X~-[X~,Y~],∀X~,Y~∈Γ⁢(T⁢M~)
	

and is of type (1,2). When the torsion tensor T~ satisfies

	
T~⁢(X~,Y~)=π~⁢(Y~)⁢X~-π~⁢(X~)⁢Y~
	

for a 1- form π~, the connection ∇~ is said to be semi-symmetric, see [13].

Let there be given a semi-Riemannian metric g~ of index ν with 1≤ν≤n in M~ and ∇~ satisfy

	
∇~⁢g~=0,
	

then such a lineer connection is called a metric connection, see [12].

We now suppose that the semi-Riemannian manifold M~ admits a semisymmetric metric connection given by

	
∇~X~Y~=∇~∘X~Y~+π~(Y~)X~-g~(X~,Y~)Q~
	

for arbitrary vector fields X~ and Y~ of M~, where ∇~∘ denotes the Levi-Civita connection with respect to the semi-Riemannian metric g~,π~ is a 1 -form and Q~ is the vector field defined by

	
g~⁢(Q~,X~)=π~⁢(X~)
	

for an arbitrary vector field X~ of M~. From (2.4), we can write

	
Q~=ϕ⁢Q+μ⁢N,
	

where Q is a vector field and μ is a function in M.

Denoting by ∇∘ the symmetric linear connection induced on the lightlike

	
∇ϕ⁢X∘ϕY=ϕ(∇X∘Y)+B(X,Y)N
	

for arbitrary vector fields X and Y of M, where B is the local second fundamental form of M. Denoting by ∇ the connection induced on the lightlike hypersurface from ∇~ the semi-symmetric metric connection, we have

	
∇~ϕ⁢X⁢ϕ⁢Y=ϕ⁢(∇X⁡Y)+m⁢(X,Y)⁢N
	

for arbitrary vector fields X and Y of M, where m is a tensor of type (0,2) of the lightlike hypersurface of M and we call (3.4) the equations of Gauss with respect to the induced connection ∇.

From (3.1), we obtain

	
∇~ϕ⁢XϕY=∇~ϕ⁢X∘ϕY+π~(ϕY)ϕX-g~(ϕX,ϕY)Q~,
	

and hence, using (3.3) and (3.4), we can also write

		+π~⁢(ϕ⁢Y)⁢ϕ⁢X-g~⁢(ϕ⁢X,ϕ⁢Y)⁢Q~	

Substituting (3.2) into (3.5), we get

	ϕ⁢(∇X⁡Y)	+m⁢(X,Y)⁢N	
		=ϕ(∇X∘Y+π(Y)X-g(X,Y)Q)+{B(X,Y)-μg(X,Y)}N,	

from this equation, we have

	
∇XY=∇X∘Y+π(Y)X-g(X,Y)Q,
	

where π⁢(X)=π~⁢(ϕ⁢X) and

	
m⁢(X,Y)=B⁢(X,Y)-μ⁢g⁢(X,Y).
	

D","3 SEMI-SYMMETRIC METRIC CONNECTION

For n>1, let M~ be an (n+1)-dimensional differentiable manifold of class C∞ and ∇~ a linear connection in M~. The torsion tensor T~ of ∇~ is given by:

	
T~⁢(X~,Y~)=∇~X~⁢Y~-∇~Y~⁢X~-[X~,Y~],∀X~,Y~∈Γ⁢(T⁢M~)
	

and have type (1,2). When the torsion tensor T~ satisfies:

	
T~⁢(X~,Y~)=π~⁢(Y~)⁢X~-π~⁢(X~)⁢Y~
	

for a 1 -form π~, the connection ∇~ is said to be semi-symmetric (Yano 1970).

Let us consider a semi-Riemannian metric g~ of index ν with 1≤ν≤n in M~ and ∇~ satisfying:

	
∇~⁢g~=0
	

A linear connection of this type is called a metric connection (O’Neill. 1983).

Now suppose that the semi-Riemannian manifold M~ admits a semisymmetric metric connection which is given by:

	
∇~X~Y~=∇X~∘Y~+π~(Y~)X~-g~(X~,Y~)Q~
	

for arbitrary vector fields X~ and Y~ on M~, where ∇∘ denotes the Levi-Civita connection with respect to the semi-Riemannian metric g~,π~ is a 1 - form and Q~ is the vector field defined by:

	
g~⁢(Q~,X~)=π~⁢(X~)
	

for an arbitrary vector field X~ on M~ (Yano 1970, Duggal & Sharma 1986). Using (4), we can write:

	
Q~=ϕ⁢Q+μ⁢N
	

where Q is a vector field and μ is a function on M.

Let us denote the symmetric linear connection induced on the lightlike hypersurface from the Levi-Civita connection ∇~∘ by ∇∘. Then we have:

	
∇ϕ⁢X∘ϕY=ϕ(∇X∘Y)+B(X,Y)N
	

for arbitrary vector fields X and Y on M, where B is the local second fundamental form of M (Duggal & Bejancu 1996). Denoting the connection induced on the lightlike hypersurface from the semi-symmetric metric connection ∇~ by ∇, we have:

	
∇~ϕ⁢X⁢ϕ⁢Y=ϕ⁢(∇X⁡Y)+m⁢(X,Y)⁢N
	

for arbitrary vector fields X and Y on M, where m is a tensor of type (0,2) of the lightlike hypersurface M and we call (8) the Gauss formula with respect to the induced connection ∇.

Using (5), we get:

	
∇~ϕ⁢XϕY=∇ϕ⁢X∘ϕY+π~(ϕY)ϕX-g~(ϕX,ϕY)Q~
	

and hence, combining (7) and (8), we can also write:

	ϕ⁢(∇X⁡Y)+m⁢(X,Y)⁢N=	ϕ⁢(∘𝑋⁢Y)+B⁢(X,Y)⁢N	
		+π~⁢(ϕ⁢Y)⁢ϕ⁢X-g~⁢(ϕ⁢X,ϕ⁢Y)⁢Q~.	

Writing the value of Q~ given by (6) in (9), we have:

	
ϕ(∇XY)+m(X,Y)N=ϕ(∇∘Y+π(Y)X-g(X,Y)Q)+{B(X,Y)-μg(X,Y)}N.
	

With respect to this equation, we obtain:

	
∇XY=∇∘Y+π(Y)X-g(X,Y)Q,
	

where π⁢(X)=π~⁢(ϕ⁢X) and

	
m⁢(X,Y)=B⁢(X,Y)-μ⁢g⁢(X,Y).

"Corollary 1. The connection induced on a totally umbilical lightlike hypersurface of a semi-Riemannian manifold with a semi-symmetric metric connection is semi-symmetric metric if and only if

	
ρ=-μ.
	

is

	
∇~ϕ⁢X∘N=-ϕ⁢(AN⁢X)+τ⁢(X)⁢N
	

for any vector field X in M, where AN is the shape operator of M and τ is the 1 -form [2].

On the other hand, we denote P as the projection of T⁢M on S⁢(T⁢M) with respect to the decomposition (2.1) and using (3.1), we get

	
∇~ϕ⁢XN=∇~ϕ⁢X∘N+λϕX-λ′ϕQ-μλ′N,
	

because of

	
π~⁢(N)=λ⁢ and ⁢g~⁢(ϕ⁢X,N)=λ′.
	

Thus using (3.10), we find

	
∇~ϕ⁢X⁢N=ϕ⁢((-AN+λ⁢I)⁢X-λ′⁢Q)+(τ⁢(X)-μ⁢λ′)⁢N,
	

where I is the unit tensor. (3.11) is called the equation of Weingarten with respect to the semi-symmetric connection.

Proposition 2. Let S⁢(T⁢M) and S⁢(T⁢M)′ be two screen distributions on M and m and m′ be the second fundamental forms with respect to tr⁡(T⁢M) and tr(TM)′, respectively. Then the local second fundamental form of M on U is independent of the choice of screen distribution.

Proof. The proof follows from (3.4) for both screen distributions S⁢(T⁢M) and S⁢(T⁢M)′. In fact, we have

	
m⁢(X,Y)=g~⁢(∇~ϕ⁢X⁢ϕ⁢Y-ϕ⁢(∇X⁡Y),ξ)=g~⁢(∇~ϕ⁢X⁢ϕ⁢Y,ξ)-g⁢(ϕ⁢(∇X⁡Y),ξ)
=g~⁢(∇~ϕ⁢X⁢ϕ⁢Y,ξ)=m′⁢(X,Y)
	

for ∀X,Y∈Γ⁢(T⁢M|U)

Thus we have the following result. Corollary 2. The second fundamental form of a totally umbilical lightlike hypersurface with a semi-symmetric connection is degenerate.

Proof. Taking into account that ∇~ is a semi-symmetric metric connection and (3.8), from Proposition 3.2 it follows that

	
m⁢(X,ξ)=ρ⁢g⁢(X,ξ)=0,∀X∈Γ⁢(T⁢M)
	

which proves the assertion.

Since we denote P as the projection of T⁢M on S⁢(T⁢M) with respect to the decomposition (2.1), we obtain

	
∇ϕ⁢X∘PϕY=ϕ(*X∘PY)+C(X,PY)ξ
	

and

	
∇ϕ⁢X⁡P⁢ϕ⁢Y=ϕ⁢(∇X*⁡P⁢Y)+D⁢(X,P⁢Y)⁢ξ,
	

where ϕ(*X∘P⁢Y) and ϕ⁢(∇X*⁡P⁢Y) belong to S⁢(T⁢M), and C,D are 1- forms on M. From (3.6), we obtain

	
∇ϕ⁢XPϕY=∇ϕ⁢X∘PϕY+π(PϕY)ϕX-g(ϕX,ϕPY)ϕQ
	

where ϕ⁢Q is a vector field defined by

	
ϕ⁢Q=P⁢Q+λ⁢ξ.
	

Thus, using (3.13) and (3.14), we have

	ϕ(∇X*PY)+D(X,PY)ξ=ϕ(∇X*PY)	+C⁢(X,P⁢Y)⁢ξ	
		+π⁢(P⁢ϕ⁢Y)⁢ϕ⁢X-g⁢(ϕ⁢X,ϕ⁢P⁢Y)⁢(ϕ⁢P⁢Q+λ⁢ξ)	

from this equation, we get

	
D⁢(X,P⁢Y)=C⁢(X,P⁢Y)-λ⁢g⁢(X,P⁢Y)
	

and

	
*X*PY=∇*∘PXY+π(PY)X-g(X,PY)PQ,
	

where π⁢(X)=π~⁢(ϕ⁢X). By using (3.16), we find

	∇ϕ⁢X*⁡(g⁢(ϕ⁢P⁢Y,ϕ⁢P⁢Z))=(∇ϕ⁢X*⁡g)⁢(P⁢ϕ⁢Y,P⁢ϕ⁢Z)+∇ϕ⁢X∘		
		(PϕY,PϕZ))	
		*∇ϕ⁢X∘g)(PϕY,PϕZ)	

from this, we obtain

	
(∇ϕ⁢X*⁡g)⁢(P⁢ϕ⁢Y,P⁢ϕ⁢Z)=0.
	

We also have from (3.16),

	
T*(ϕ⁢X,ϕ⁢Y)=π⁢(P⁢Y)⁢X-π⁢(P⁢X)⁢Y.
	

From (3.17) and (3.18), we have the following proposition.

Proposition 3. The connection ∇* induced on a screen distribution of totally umbilical lightlike hypersurface is a semi-symmetric metric connection.","Here, we note that the induced connection ∇ is a metric connection if the lightlike hypersurface is totally geodesic with respect to a semi-symmetric metric connection ∇~ and μ=0.

The Weingarten formula with respect to the Levi-Civita connection ∇∘ is:

	
∇~ϕ⁢X∘N=-ϕ(AN∘X)+τ(X)N
	

for any vector field X on M, where ∘N is the shape operator of M and τ is the 1form (Duggal & Bejancu 1996).

On the other hand, denoting the projection of T⁢M on S⁢(T⁢M) with respect to the decomposition (1) by P and using (5), we get:

	
∇~ϕ⁢XN=∇ϕ⁢X∘N+λϕX-η(X)ϕQ-μη(X)N,
	

since

	
π~⁢(N)=g~⁢(Q~,N)=g~⁢(P⁢ϕ⁢Q+λ⁢ξ+μ⁢N,N)=λ⁢g⁢(ξ,N)=λ.
	

Therefore, using (14), we see that:

	
∇~ϕ⁢X⁢N=-ϕ⁢(AN⁢X+η⁢(X)⁢Q)+(τ⁢(X)-η⁢(X))⁢N,
	

where AN=A∘-λI and I is the unit tensor. Equation (15) is called the Weingarten formula with respect to the semi-symmetric connection.

Proposition 2. Let S⁢(T⁢M) and S⁢(T⁢M)′ be two screen distributions on M and m and m l be the second fundamental forms with respect to tr⁡(T⁢M) and tr(TM)′, respectively. Then m=m′ on U that is the local second fundamental form of M on U with respect to a semi-symmetric connection ∇ is independent of the choice of screen distribution.

Proof. The proof follows from (8) for both screen distributions S⁢(T⁢M) and S⁢(T⁢M)′. In fact, we have:

	m⁢(X,Y)	=g~⁢(∇~ϕ⁢X⁢ϕ⁢Y-ϕ⁢(∇X⁡Y),ξ)	
		=g~⁢(∇~ϕ⁢X⁢ϕ⁢Y,ξ)-g⁢(ϕ⁢(∇X⁡Y),ξ)	
		=g~⁢(∇~ϕ⁢X⁢ϕ⁢Y,ξ)	
		=m′⁢(X,Y)	

for any vector fields X and Y on M.

Thus we have:

Corollary 1. The second fundamental form with respect to a semi-symmetric connection of a lightlike hypersurface is degenerate.

Since we denote the projection of T⁢M on S⁢(T⁢M) with respect the decomposition (1) by P we have:

	
∇X∘PϕY=ϕ(*∘X*PY)+C(X,PY)ξ
	

and

	
∇∘ξ=-ϕ(*∘ξ*X)-τ(X)ξ
	

Γ⁢(S⁢(T⁢M)) and C is 1 -form on M such that C is defined by:

	
C⁢(X,P⁢Y)=g⁢(A𝑁⁢X,P⁢Y)
	

(Duggal & Bejancu 1996). Taking care of the equation (16), we have:

	
∇ϕ⁢X⁡P⁢ϕ⁢Y=ϕ⁢(∇X*⁡P⁢Y)+D⁢(X,P⁢Y)⁢ξ
	

where ϕ⁢(∇X*⁡P⁢Y) belongs to Γ⁢(S⁢(T⁢M)) and D is 1 -form on M.

From (10), we obtain:

	
∇ϕ⁢X⁡P⁢ϕ⁢Y=∘ϕ⁢X⁢P⁢ϕ⁢Y+π⁢(P⁢ϕ⁢Y)⁢ϕ⁢X-g⁢(ϕ⁢X,P⁢ϕ⁢Y)⁢ϕ⁢Q
	

where ϕ⁢Q is a vector field defined by: ϕ⁢Q=P⁢Q+λ⁢ξ.

Using (16) and (19), we have:

		+π⁢(P⁢ϕ⁢Y)⁢ϕ⁢X-g⁢(X,P⁢Y)⁢(P⁢ϕ⁢Q+λ⁢ξ)	

from which:

	
D⁢(X,P⁢Y)=C⁢(X,P⁢Y)-λ⁢g⁢(X,P⁢Y)
	

and

	
PX*Y=∇X*∘PY+π(PY)X-g(X,PY)PQ
	

for any X,Y∈Γ⁢(T⁢M).

By using (21), we find:

From this equation, we get:

	
(∇X*⁡g)⁢(P⁢Y,P⁢Z)=0
	

From (21), we also have:

	
T*(P⁢X,P⁢Y)=π⁢(P⁢Y)⁢P⁢X-π⁢(P⁢X)⁢P⁢Y
	

Combining (22) and (23), we have:

"5 Equations of Gauss and Codazzi

We denote by

the curvature tensor of M~ with respect to Levi-Civita connection ∇~∘ and by

	
K∘(X,Y)Z=∇X∘∇Y∘Z-∇Y∘∇X∘Z-∇[X,Y]∘Z
	

that of M with respect to induced connection ∇∘. Then the Gauss-Codazzi equations of lightlike hypersurface are given by

	g~(K~∘(ϕX,ϕY,ϕZ),PϕW)	=ϕ(g(K∘(X,Y)Z,PW))	
		+B⁢(X,Z)⁢C⁢(Y,P⁢W)-B⁢(Y,Z)⁢C⁢(X,P⁢W),

K~∘(ϕ⁢X,ϕ⁢Y,ϕ⁢Z,ϕ⁢P⁢W)=g~⁢(K~⁢(ϕ⁢X,ϕ⁢Y)⁢ϕ⁢Z,ϕ⁢P⁢W)
	

and

	
K⁢(X,Y,Z,P⁢W)=g⁢(K⁢(X,Y)⁢Z,P⁢W).
	

Now, we shall find the equations of Gauss and Codazzi of totally umbilical lightlike hypersurface with a semi-symmetric connection. The curvature tensor of M~ with respect to a semi-symmetric metric connection ∇~ is

	
R~⁢(X~,Y~)⁢Z~=∇~X~⁢∇~Y~⁢Z~-∇~Y~⁢∇~X~⁢Z~-∇~[X~,Y~]⁢Z~.
	

Putting X~=ϕ⁢X,Y~=ϕ⁢Y,Z~=ϕ⁢Z, we get

	
R~⁢(ϕ⁢X,ϕ⁢Y)⁢ϕ⁢Z=∇~ϕ⁢X⁢∇~ϕ⁢Y⁢ϕ⁢Z-∇~ϕ⁢Y⁢∇~ϕ⁢X⁢ϕ⁢Z-∇~ϕ⁢[X,Y]⁢ϕ⁢Z.
	

Thus, using (3.4), (3.8), (3.10) and (3.12), we have

where R⁢(X,Y)⁢Z=∇X⁡∇Y⁡Z-∇Y⁡∇X⁡Z-∇[X,Y]⁡Z is the curvature tensor of a totally umbilical lightlike hypersurface with a semi-symmetric connection ∇.

R~⁢(X~,Y~,Z~,ξ~)=g~⁢(R~⁢(X~,Y~)⁢Z~,ξ~),R⁢(X,Y,Z,ξ)=g⁢(R⁢(X,Y)⁢Z,ξ)

We call equations (4.5)-(4.7) the Gauss-Codazzi equations of the totally umbilical lightlike hypersurface with a semi-symmetric connection.","4 EQUATIONS OF GAUSS AND CODAZZI

We denote the curvature tensor of M~ with respect to the Levi-Civita connection ∇~∘ by:

and the curvature tensor of M with respect to induced connection ∇∘ by:

	
R∘(X,Y)Z=∇∘∘𝑋∘𝑌Z-∇∘∇∘Z-∇∘Z.
	

The Gauss-Codazzi equations of the lightlike hypersurface are given by:

	g~⁢(R~~⁢(ϕ⁢X,ϕ⁢Y)⁢ϕ⁢Z,P⁢ϕ⁢W)=	g(R(X,Y)Z,PW)∘	
		+B⁢(X,Z)⁢C⁢(Y,P⁢W)-B⁢(Y,Z)⁢C⁢(X,P⁢W),	
	g~⁢(R~~⁢(ϕ⁢X,ϕ⁢Y)⁢ϕ⁢Z,ξ)=	(∇X⁡B)⁢(Y,Z)-(∇Y⁡B)⁢(X,Z)	
		+B⁢(Y,Z)⁢τ⁢(X)-B⁢(X,Z)⁢τ⁢(Y),	

and

	
g~(R~˙(ϕX,ϕY)ϕZ,N)=g~(R∘(ϕX,ϕY)ϕZ,N)
	

for any X,Y,Z,W∈Γ (TM) (Duggal & Bejancu 1996).

Now we shall find the equations of Gauss and Codazzi of the lightlike hypersurface with a semi-symmetric connection. The curvature tensor of the semi-symmetric metric connection ∇~ of M~ is, by definition,

	
R~⁢(X~,Y~)⁢Z~=∇~X~⁢∇~Y~⁢Z~-∇~Y~⁢∇~X~⁢Z~-∇~[X~,Y~]⁢Z~
	

Writing X~=ϕ⁢X,Y~=ϕ⁢Y,Z~=ϕ⁢Z, we obtain:

Thus, using (8) and (14), we have:

	R~⁢(ϕ⁢X,ϕ⁢Y)⁢ϕ⁢Z=	ϕ⁢(R⁢(X,Y)⁢Z)+m⁢(X,Z)⁢(AN⁢Y+η⁢(Y)⁢Q)-m⁢(Y,Z)⁢(AN⁢X+η⁢(X)⁢Q)

		+m(Y,Z)(τ(X)-μη(X))-m(X,Z)(τ(Y)-μη(Y))}N	

where R⁢(X,Y)⁢Z=∇X⁡∇Y⁡Z-∇Y⁡∇X⁡Z-∇[X,Y]⁡Z is the curvature tensor of the lightlike hypersurface with a semi-symmetric connection ∇.

Then, we combining (14),(18),(20) and (27) we have:

"6 The Ricci Tensor of Totally Umbilical Lightlike Hypersurface with Semi-Symmetric Connection

The Ricci tensor with respect to semi-symmetric connection of a totally umbilical lightlike hypersurface is defined by

	
Ric⁡(ϕ⁢X,ϕ⁢Y)=trace⁡{ϕ⁢Z⟶R⁢(ϕ⁢X,ϕ⁢Z)⁢ϕ⁢Y},∀ϕ⁢X,ϕ⁢Y,ϕ⁢Z∈Γ⁢(T⁢M)⁢. 
	

Locally, Ricci tensor with respect to semi-symmetric connection of a totally umbilical lightlike hypersurface is given by

	
Ric⁡(ϕ⁢X,ϕ⁢Y)=∑i=1n-1εi⁢g⁢(R⁢(ϕ⁢X,ϕ⁢wi)⁢ϕ⁢Y,ϕ⁢wi)+g⁢(R⁢(ϕ⁢X,ξ)⁢ϕ⁢Y,N),
	

where {wi,…,wn-1} is a local orthonormal frames field on M, see [2].

Thus, by using (3.8), (3.14), (4.4) and (5.2) we obtain

	Ric⁡(ϕ⁢X,ϕ⁢Y)-Ric⁡(ϕ⁢Y,ϕ⁢X)	={ρ+μ}⁢g⁢(X,P⁢Y)⁢η⁢(ϕ⁢Y)	
	-	{ρ+μ}⁢g⁢(Y,P⁢X)⁢η⁢(ϕ⁢X)+2⁢d⁢τ⁢(ϕ⁢X,ϕ⁢Y),	

for any ϕ⁢X,ϕ⁢Y∈Γ⁢(T⁢M).

From (5.3), we have the following results. Proposition 4. Let (M,g,S⁢(T⁢M)) be a totally umbilical lightlike hypersurface of a semi-Riemannian manifold M~ with a semi-symmetric metric connection. Then Ricci tensor with respect to semi-symmetric connection of a totally umbilical lightlike hypersurface is symmetric if and only if the 1 - form τ is closed and

	
ρ=-μ.
	

P","5 THE RICCI TENSOR

For n>1, let M be a lightlike hypersurface of an (n+1)-dimensional semiRiemannian manifold M~ with a semi-symmetric metric connection. Considering the definition of the Ricci tensor of M with respect to the symmetric connection, we define the Ricci tensor of M with respect to semi-symmetric connection by:

	
Ric⁡(X,Y)=trace⁡{Z→R⁢(X,Z)⁢Y}
	

for any X,Y,Z∈Γ⁢(T⁢M). Thus, the Ricci tensor of M with respect to a semisymmetric connection is given by:

	
Ric⁡(X,Y)=∑i=1n-1εi⁢g⁢(R⁢(X,Wi)⁢Y,Wi)+g~⁢(R⁢(X,ξ)⁢Y,N)
	

where {W1,…,Wn-1} is an orthonormal basis of the screen distribution. Hence, by using (10) and (32) we get:

	
Ric⁡(X,Y)-Ric⁡(Y,X)=2⁢d⁢τ⁢(X,Y)+(n-2)⁢d⁢π⁢(X,Y)
	

for any ∀X,Y∈Γ⁢(T⁢M)

From (33) we have:

Proposition 4. Let M be a lightlike hypersurface of a semi-Riemannian manifold M~ with a semi-symmetric metric connection.

P r o of. If L⁢(H) is selfcentered, then L⁢(H)=Per⁡(L⁢(H)) holds. Now assume H contains two nodes x and y which are not endnodes and such that each edge is adjacent to just one of the nodes x and y.

Assume now that there exists a graph G such that L⁢(H) is the periphery of L⁢(G). Then we have 2≥r⁢(L⁢(H))≥r⁢(Per⁡(L⁢(G)))≥d⁢(L⁢(G)).

Proof. Suppose not and pick F1 and F2 in Pf⁢(𝒯∘) and δ>0 such that for each i∈{1,2}, each H∈Pf⁢(ℕ), each a∈S∩(0,δ), there is some f∈Fi such that a+∑t∈Hf⁢(t)∉Ai.

Let F=F1∪F2,k=|F|, and write F={f1,f2,…,fk}. Pick by Exercise 14.2.1., in [8], some n∈ℕ such that whenever length n words over the alphabet {1,2,…,k} are 2 -colored, there is a variable word w⁢(v) such that {w⁢(l):l∈{1,2,…,k}} is monochromatic.

Let h∈𝒯0. For each t∈ℕ, we can choose st∈ℕ such that h⁢(st)<12t+1⁢δ. Since we could replace each fi by the sequence fi′, defined by fi′⁢(t)=fi⁢(st), we may suppose that ∑t=1∞h⁢(t)<12⁢δ.

Let W be the set of length n words over {1,2,…,k}. It is obvious that W is a finite set. If w=b1⁢b2⁢⋯⁢bn∈ W (where each bi∈{1,2,⋯,k} ), define gw⁢(t)=∑i=1nfbi⁢(n⁢t+i). Since {gw:w∈W} is finite, there exists c∈(0,12⁢δ) and K∈Pf⁢(ℕ) such that c+∑t∈Kgw⁢(t)∈A for each w∈W. Define φ:W→{1,2} by φ⁢(w)=1 if c+∑t∈Kgw⁢(t)∈A1 and φ⁢(w)=2 otherwise. We can choose a variable word w⁢(v) of length n, such that φ is constant on {w(l):∤∈{1,2,…,k}}. We may suppose that φ⁢(w⁢(j))=1 for every j∈{1,2,…,k}. Suppose that w⁢(v)=b1⁢b2⁢⋯⁢bn. Let C={i∈{1,⋯,n}:bi∈{1,⋯,k}} and let I={i∈{1,⋯,n}:bi=v}. Then, for each j∈{1,2,⋯,k}, we have

	
c+∑t∈Kgw⁢(j)⁢(t)=c+∑t∈K∑i∈Cfbi⁢(n⁢t+i)+∑t∈K∑i∈Ifj⁢(n⁢t+i).
	

Let a=c+∑t∈K∑i∈Cfbi⁢(n⁢t+i). Then a∈(0,δ) and a+∑t∈K∑i∈Ifj⁢(n⁢t+i)∈A1 for every j∈ {1,2,⋯,k}. Putting H=n⁢K+I, we have

	
∑t∈K∑i∈Ifj⁢(n⁢t+i)=∑t∈Hfj⁢(t)
	

because the sets of the form n⁢K+i, with i∈I, are pairwise disjoint. It follows that a+∑t∈Hfj⁢(t)∈A1 for every j∈{1,2,⋯,k} - a contradiction.

Theorem 3.9. Let S be a dense subsemigroup of ((0,∞),+). Then J0⁢(S) is a compact two sided ideal of 0+.

E. Bayatmanesh, M. Akbari Tootkaboni / Topology and its Applications 210 (2016) 70-80 77 Proof. Trivially J0⁢(S) is closed subset of β⁢S. Let p∈J0⁢(S) and let q∈β⁢S. We show q+p∈J0⁢(S) and p+q∈J0⁢(S).

To see q+p∈J0⁢(S), let A∈q+p,F∈Pf⁢(𝒯0) and pick δ>0. Then {b∈S:-b+A∈p}∈q so pick b∈S∩(0,δ2) such that -b+A∈p. Pick H∈Pf⁢(ℕ) and a∈S∩(0,δ2) such that for each f∈F, a+∑t∈Hf⁢(t)∈-b+A. Therefore for each F∈P(𝒯0) and each δ>0, there exists H∈Pf⁢(ℕ) and c=a+b∈S∩(0,δ) such that a+b+∑t∈Hf⁢(t)∈A.

To see p+q∈J0⁢(S), let A∈p+q and let B={x∈S:-x+A∈q}. Then B∈p so for F∈Pf⁢(𝒯0) and δ>0, pick H∈Pf⁢(ℕ) and a∈S∩(0,δ2) such that for each f∈F,a+∑t∈Hf⁢(t)∈B. Then ⋂f∈F(-(a+∑t∈Hf⁢(t))+A)∈q so pick b∈⋂f∈F(-(a+∑t∈Hf⁢(t))+A)⁢⋂(0,δ2). Therefore for each F∈Pf⁢(𝒯0) and each δ>0, there exists H∈Pf⁢(ℕ) and c=a+b∈S∩(0,δ) such that a+b+∑t∈Hf⁢(t)∈A. This implies that p+q∈J0⁢(S).

Theorem 3.10. Let S be a dense subsemigroup of ((0,∞),+), let A⊆S. Then A¯∩J0⁢(S)≠∅ if and only if A is a J-set near zero.

Proof. The necessity is trivial. By Lemma 3.8, J-sets near zero are partition regular. So, if A is a J-set near zero, by Theorem 1.2, there is some p∈β⁢S such that A∈p and for every B∈p,B is a J-set near zero. As a consequence, we have the following corollary similar to Theorem 3.4. Corollary 3.11. Let S be a dense subsemigroup of ((0,∞),+), and let A be a piecewise syndetic near zero subset of S. Then A is a J-set near zero.

Proof. By Theorem 2.7, A¯∩K⁢(0+⁢(S))≠∅. Since K⁢(0+⁢(S))⊆J0⁢(S), thus A¯∩J0⁢(S)≠∅ so by Theorem 3.10, A is a J-set near zero.

Corollary 3.12. Let S be a dense subsemigroup of ((0,∞),+) and A be a central set near zero in S. Then A is a C-set near zero. Proof. It is obvious. Lemma 3.13. Let J be a set, (D,≤) be a directed set, and S be a dense subsemigroup of ((0,∞),+). Let {Ti}i∈D be a decreasing family of nonempty subsets of S, such that 1) 0∈c⁢lℝ⁢Ti, 2) ⋂i∈DTi=∅, and 3) for each i∈D and each x∈Ti, there is some j∈D such that x+Tj⊆Ti. Let Q=⋂i∈Dc⁢lβ⁢Sd⁢Ti. Then Q is a compact subsemigroup of 0+⁢(S). Let {Ei}i∈D and {Ii}i∈D be decreasing families of nonempty subsets of Πt∈J⁢S with the following properties: (a) for each i∈D,Ii⊆Ei⊆Πt∈J⁢Ti, (b) for each i∈D and each x→∈Ii, there exists j∈D such that x→+Ej⊆Ii, and (c) for each i∈D and each x→∈Ei\Ii, there exists j∈D such that x→+Ej⊆Ei and x→+Ij⊆Ii. Let Y=Πt∈J⁢0+⁢(S),E=⋂i∈Dc⁢lY⁢Ei, and I=⋂i∈Dc⁢lY⁢Ii. Then E is a subsemigroup of Πt∈J⁢Q and I is an ideal of E. If, in addition, either (d) for each i∈D,Ti=S and {a∈S:a¯∉Ei} is not piecewise syndetic near zero,

78 E. Bayatmanesh, M. Akbari Tootkaboni / Topology and its Applications 210 (2016) 70-80 or (e) for each i∈D and each a∈Ti,a¯∈Ei, then given any p∈K⁢(Q), one has p¯∈E∩K⁢(Πt∈J⁢Q)=K⁢(E)⊆I. Proof. By Theorem 4.20 in [8], Q is a subsemigroup of 0+⁢(S). For the proof that E is a subsemigroup of Πt∈J⁢Q and I is an ideal of E, see the proof of Lemma 14.9 in [8]. To complete the proof, assume that (d) or (e) holds. It suffices to establish if p∈K⁢(Q), then p¯∈E. Indeed, assume we have established (*). Then p¯∈E∩Πt∈J⁢K⁢(Q) and Πt∈J⁢K⁢(Q)=K⁢(Πt∈J⁢Q) by Theorem 2.23 in [8]. Then by Theorem 1.65 in [8], K⁢(E)=E∩K⁢(Πt∈J⁢Q) and, since I is an ideal of E, K⁢(E)⊆I

To establish (*), let p∈K⁢(Q) be given. To see that p¯∈E, let i∈D be given and let U be a neighborhood of p¯. Pick F∈Pf⁢(J) and for each t∈F, pick some At∈p such that ⋂t∈Fπt-1⁢[c⁢lβ⁢Sd⁢At]⊆U, where πt is a projection for t∈J.

Assume now that (d) holds. Since p∈K⁢(0+⁢(S)) and {a∈S:a¯∉Ei} are not piecewise syndetic near zero, so by Theorem 2.7, {a∈S:a¯∉Ei}∉p and hence {a∈S:a¯∈Ei}∈p. Now pick a∈(⋂t∈FAt)∩{a∈S:a¯∈Ei}. Then a¯∈U∩Ei. If (e) holds, see the proof of Lemma 14.9 in [8]. The proof of the following theorem is similar to the proof of Theorem 2.7 in [4]. Theorem 3.14. Let S be a dense subsemigroup of ((0,∞),+) and A⊆S. Then A is a C-set near zero if and only if there is an idempotent in A¯∩J0⁢(S). Proof. Sufficiency. Let A*={x∈A:-x+A∈p}. By Lemma 4.14 in [8] if x∈A* then -x+A*∈p. For every δ∈(0,1) we define αδ⁢(F) and Hδ⁢(F) for F∈Pf⁢(𝒯0) by induction on |F| such that (1) if F,G∈Pf⁢(𝒯0) and F⊂G, then maxδ⁡(F)<minδ⁡(G) and (2) if m∈ℕ,G1,…,Gm∈Pf⁢(𝒯0),G1⊂G2⊂⋯⊂Gn=F, and for all i∈{1,2,…,m},fi∈Gi, then

	
∑i=1m(αδ⁢(Gi)+∑t∈Hδ⁢(Gi)fi⁢(t))∈A*
	

If F={f}, since A* is a J-set near zero, pick αδ⁢(F)∈S∩(0,δ) and Hδ⁢(F)∈Pf⁢(ℕ) such that αδ⁢(F)+∑t∈Hδ⁢(Gi)fi⁢(t)∈A*.

Now assume that |F|>1 and αδ⁢(K) and Hδ⁢(K) have been chosen for all K with ∅≠K⊂F. Let r=max⁢⋃{Hδ⁢(K):∅≠K⊂F}. Let B=A*∩∩{-(∑i=1m(αδ(Gi)+∑t∈Hδ⁢(Gi)fi(t)))+A*:m∈ℕ, G1,G2,…,Gm∈Pf⁢(𝒯0),G1⊂G2⊂⋯⊂Gn=F, and (∀i∈{1,2,…,m})(fi∈Gi)} Then B∈p so pick by Lemma 3.3, αδ⁢(F)∈S∩(0,δ) and Hδ⁢(F)∈Pf⁢(ℕ) such min⁡Hδ⁢(F)>r and for each f∈F,αδ⁢(F)+∑t∈Hδ⁢(F)f⁢(t)∈B

Necessity. For each k∈ℕ, pick α1k and H1k as guaranteed by the definition of C-set near zero. For F∈Pf⁢(𝒯0) and k∈ℕ, let

	TF,k	={∑i=1m(α1k(Gi)+∑t∈H1k⁢(Gi)fi(t)):m∈ℕ,G1,G2,…,Gm∈Pf(𝒯0),	
		F⊂G1⊂G2⊂⋯⊂Gm, and (∀i∈{1,2,…,m})(fi∈Gi)}	

Then each TF,k≠∅. Let Qk=⋂F∈Pf⁢(𝒯0)TF,k¯. We show first that Qk is semigroup. Given F,G∈Pf⁢(𝒯0), TF∪G,k⊆TF,k∩TG,k and so Qk≠∅. By Theorem 4.20 in [8],

	
(∀F∈Pf⁢(𝒯0))⁢(∀x∈TF,k)⁢(∃X∈Pf⁢(𝒯0))⁢(TX,k⊆-x+TF,k)
	

so let F∈Pf⁢(𝒯0) and let x∈TF,k. Pick m,G1,G2,…,Gm, and f1,f2,…,fm as in the definition of TF,k so that x=∑i=1m(α1k⁢(Gi)+∑t∈H1k⁢(Gi)fi⁢(t)). Then TGm,k⊆-x+TF,k.

We show that K⁢(Qk)⊆A¯∩J0⁢(S), so that any idempotent in K⁢(Qk) establishes the result. We have that each TF,k⊆A so Qk⊆A¯. Now let p∈K⁢(Qk) and let B∈p. We need to show that B is J-set near zero, so let F∈Pf⁢(𝒯0) be given. Let k=|F| and write F={f1,f2,…,fk}. Let 𝒟={G∈Pf⁢(𝒯0):F⊆G} and note that Qk=⋂G∈𝒟TG,k¯.

Let Y=Πi=1k⁢0+⁢(S). By Theorem 2.22 in [8], Y is a right topological semigroup and if x→∈Πi=1k⁢S, then λx→ is continuous. For G∈𝒟 and for k∈ℕ, let

	
IG,k={x→∈Πi=1kTG,k:(∃d∈S∩(0,1k))
(x→=(d+∑t∈Lf1(t),…,d+∑t∈Lfk(t)))}
	

and let EG,k=IG,k∪{(d,d,…,d):d∈TG,k}. Let Ik=⋂G∈𝒟c⁢lY⁢IG,k and let Ek=⋂G∈𝒟c⁢lY⁢EG,k. We claim that Ek is a subsemigroup of ∏i=1lQk and that Ik is an ideal of Ek.

Trivially Ek⊆Πi=1l⁢Qk. Given G1,G2∈𝒟 we have that IG1∪G2,k⊆IG1,k∩IG2,k so to see that Ik≠∅ it suffices to let G∈𝒟 and show that IG,k≠∅. Pick G1,G2∈𝒟 such that G⊂G1⊂G2. Let L=H1k⁢(G2). Let d=α1k⁢(G1)+∑t∈H1k⁢(G1)f1⁢(t)+α1k⁢(G2). Then (d+∑t∈Lf1⁢(t),…,d+∑t∈Lfk⁢(t))∈IG,k.

Now let q→,r→∈Ek. We show that q→+r→∈Ek and, if either q→∈Ik or r→∈Ik, then q→+r→∈Ik. To this end, let G∈𝒟 and let U be an open neighborhood of q→+r→. Pick a neighborhood V of q→ such that V+r→⊆U. Pick x→∈V∩EG,k, with x→∈IG,k if q→∈Ik. For each i∈{1,2,…,k}, we have that xi∈TG,k so pick Xi∈𝒟 such that TXi,k⊆-xi+TG,k and let X=⋃i=1kXi. Pick a neighborhood W of r→ such that x→+W⊆U→. Pick y→∈W∩EX,k with y→∈IX,k if r→∈Ik. Then x→+y→∈EG,k and, if x→∈IG,k or y→∈IX,k, then x→+y→∈IG,k.

Recall that we have chosen p∈K⁢(Qk) and B∈p. We claim that p¯=(p,p,…,p)∈Ek. To see this let G∈𝒟 be given and let U be a neighborhood of p¯ in Y. Pick C∈p such that Πi=1k⁢C¯⊆U and pick d∈C∩TG,k. Then (d,d,…,d)∈U∩EG,k. By Theorem 2.23 in [8], we have that K⁢(Πi=1k⁢Qk)=Πi=1k⁢K⁢(Qk) so p¯∈Ek∩K⁢(Πi=1k⁢Qk). Therefore by Theorem 1.65 in [8] we have that p¯∈K⁢(Ek) and, since Ik is an ideal of Ek, we have that p¯∈Ik. Since ∏i=1kB¯ is a neighborhood of p¯, we have some x→∈∏i=1kB¯∩∏i=1kTF,k. Thus B is a J-set near zero as required.","Lemma 3.9. Let S be a dense subsemigroup of ((0,∞),+), and A1 and A2 be subsets of S. If A1∪A2 is a J-set near zero, then either A1 or A2 is a J-set near zero.

Proof. Suppose not and pick F1 and F2 in Pf⁢(𝒯∘) and δ>0 such that for each i∈{1,2}, each H∈Pf⁢(ℕ), each a∈S∩(0,δ), there is some f∈Fi such that a+∑t∈Hf⁢(t)∉Ai.

Let F=F1∪F2,k=|F|, and write F={f1,f2,…,fk}. Pick by Exercise 14.2.1., in [8], some n∈ℕ such that whenever length n words over the alphabet {1,2,…,k} are 2-colored, there is a variable word w⁢(v) such that {w⁢(l):l∈{1,2,…,k}} is monochromatic.

Let h∈𝒯0. For each t∈ℕ, we can choose st∈ℕ such that h⁢(st)<12t+1⁢δ. Since we could replace each fi by sequence fi′, defined by fi′⁢(t)=fi⁢(st), we may suppose that ∑t=1∞h⁢(t)<12⁢δ. Let W be the set of length n words over {1,2,…,k}. It is obvious that W is a finite set. If w= b1⁢b2⁢⋯⁢bn∈W (where each bi∈{1,2,⋯,k} ), define gw⁢(t)=∑i=1nfbi⁢(n⁢t+i). Since {gw:w∈W} is finite, there exists c∈(0,12⁢δ) and K∈Pf⁢(ℕ) such that c+∑t∈Kgw⁢(t)∈A for each w∈W. Define φ:W→{1,2} by φ⁢(w)=1 if c+∑t∈Kgw⁢(t)∈A1 and φ⁢(w)=2 otherwise. We can choose a variable word w⁢(v) of length n, such that φ is constant on {w⁢(l):l∈{1,2,…,k}}. We may suppose that φ⁢(w⁢(j))=1 for all j∈{1,2,…,k}. Suppose that w=b1⁢b2⁢⋯⁢bn. Let C={i∈{1,…,n}:bi∈{1,…,k}} and let I={i∈{1,…,n}:bi=v}. Then, for each j∈{1,2,…,k}, we have

	
c+∑t∈Kgw⁢(j)⁢(t)=c+∑t∈K∑i∈Cfbi⁢(n⁢t+i)+∑t∈K∑i∈Ifj⁢(n⁢t+i).
	

Let a=c+∑t∈K∑i∈Cfbi⁢(n⁢t+i). Then a∈(0,δ) and ∑t∈K∑i∈Ifj⁢(n⁢t+i)∈A1 for every j∈{1,2,…,k}. Putting H=n⁢K+I, we have

	
∑t∈K∑i∈Ifj⁢(n⁢t+i)=∑t∈Hfj⁢(t)
	

because the sets of the form n⁢K+i, with i∈I, are pairwise disjoint. It follows that a+∑t∈Hfj⁢(t)∈A1 for every j∈{1,2,…,k} a contradiction.

Theorem 3.10. Let S be a dense subsemigroup of ((0,∞),+). Then J0⁢(S) is a compact two sided ideal of 0+. Proof. Trivially J0⁢(S) is closed subset of β⁢S. Let p∈J0⁢(S) and let q∈0+. We show q+p∈J0⁢(S) and p+q∈J0⁢(S)

To see q+p∈J0⁢(S), let A∈q+p,F∈Pf⁢(𝒯0) and pick δ>0. Then {b∈S:-b+A∈p}∈q so pick b∈S∩(0,δ2) such that -b+A∈p. Pick H∈Pf⁢(ℕ) and a∈S∩(0,δ2) such that for each f∈F, a+∑t∈Hf⁢(t)∈-b+A. Therefore for each F∈Pf⁢(𝒯0) and each δ>0, there exists H∈Pf⁢(ℕ) and c=a+b∈S∩(0,δ) such that a+b+∑t∈Hf⁢(t)∈A.

To see p+q∈J0⁢(S), let A∈p+q and let B={x∈S:-x+A∈q}. Then B∈p so for F∈Pf⁢(𝒯0) and δ>0, pick H∈Pf⁢(ℕ) and a∈S∩(0,δ2) such that for each f∈F,a+∑t∈Hf⁢(t)∈B. Then ⋂f∈F(-(a+∑t∈Hf⁢(t))+A)∈q so pick b∈⋂f∈F(-(a+∑t∈Hf⁢(t))+A)⁢⋂(0,δ2). Therefore for each F∈P(𝒯0) and each δ>0, there exists H∈Pf(ℕ and c=a+b∈S∩(0,δ) such that a+b+∑t∈Hf⁢(t)∈A. This implies that p+q∈J0⁢(S).

Theorem 3.11. Let S be a dense subsemigroup of ((0,∞),+), let A⊆S. Then A¯∩J0⁢(S)≠∅ if and only if A is a J-set near zero.

E. Bayatmanesh, M. Akbari Tootkaboni/ Topology and its Applications 248 (2018) 128-137 135 Proof. The necessity is trivial. By Lemma 3.9, J-sets near zero are partition regular. So, if A is a J-set near zero, by Theorem 1.2, there is some p∈β⁢S such that A∈p and for every B∈p,B is a J-set near zero. As a consequence, we have the following corollary similar to Theorem 3.5. Corollary 3.12. Let S be a dense subsemigroup of ((0,∞),+), and let A be a piecewise syndetic near zero subset of S. Then A is a J-set near zero.

Proof. By Theorem 2.8, A¯∩K⁢(0+⁢(S))≠∅. Since K⁢(0+⁢(S))⊆J0⁢(S), thus A¯∩J0⁢(S)≠∅ so by Theorem 3.11, A is a J-set near zero.

Corollary 3.13. Let S be a dense subsemigroup of ((0,∞),+) and A be a central set near zero in S. Then A is a C-set near zero. Proof. It is obvious. Lemma 3.14. Let J be a set, (D,≤) be a directed set, and S be a dense subsemigroup of ((0,∞),+). Let {Ti}i∈D be a decreasing family of nonempty subsets of S, such that 1) 0∈c⁢lℝ⁢Ti, 2) ⋂i∈DTi=∅, and 3) for each i∈D and each x∈Ti, there is some j∈D such that x+Tj⊆Ti. Let Q=⋂i∈Dc⁢lβ⁢Sd⁢Ti. Then Q is a compact subsemigroup of 0+⁢(S). Let {Ei}i∈D and {Ii}i∈D be decreasing families of nonempty subsets of Πt∈J⁢S with the following properties: (a) for each i∈D,Ii⊆Ei⊆Πt∈J⁢Ti, (b) for each i∈D and each x→∈Ii, there exists j∈D such that x→+Ej⊆Ii, and (c) for each i∈D and each x→∈Ei\Ii, there exists j∈D such that x→+Ej⊆Ei and x→+Ij⊆Ii. Let Y=Πt∈J⁢0+⁢(S),E=⋂i∈Dc⁢lY⁢Ei, and I=⋂i∈Dc⁢lY⁢Ii. Then E is a subsemigroup of Πt∈J⁢Q and I is an ideal of E. If, in addition, either (d) for each i∈D,Ti=S and {a∈S:a¯∉Ei} is not piecewise syndetic near zero, or (e) for each i∈D and each a∈Ti,a¯∈Ei, then given any p∈K⁢(Q), one has p¯∈E∩K⁢(Πt∈J⁢Q)=K⁢(E)⊆I. Proof. By Theorem 4.20 in [8], Q is a subsemigroup of 0+⁢(S). For the proof that E is a subsemigroup of Πt∈J⁢Q and I is an ideal of E, see the proof of Lemma 14.9 in [8]. To complete the proof, assume that (d) or (e) holds. It suffices to establish if p∈K⁢(Q), then p¯∈E. (*) Indeed, assume we have established (*). Then p¯∈E∩Πt∈J⁢K⁢(Q) and Πt∈J⁢K⁢(Q)=K⁢(Πt∈J⁢Q) by Theorem 2.23 in [8]. Then by Theorem 1.65 in [8], K⁢(E)=E∩K⁢(Πt∈J⁢Q) and, since I is an ideal of E, K⁢(E)⊆I

To establish (*), let p∈K⁢(Q) be given. To see that p¯∈E, let i∈D be given and let U be a neighborhood of p¯. Pick F∈Pf⁢(J) and for each t∈F, pick some At∈p such that ⋂t∈Fπt-1⁢[c⁢lβ⁢Sd⁢At]⊆U, where πt is a projection for t∈J.

Assume now that (d) holds. Since p∈K⁢(0+⁢(S)) and {a∈S:a¯∉Ei} are not piecewise syndetic near zero, so by Theorem 2.8, {a∈S:a¯∉Ei}∉p and hence {a∈S:a¯∈Ei}∈p. Now pick a∈(⋂t∈FAt)∩{a∈S:a¯∈Ei}. Then a¯∈U∩Ei. If (e) holds, see the proof of Lemma 14.9 in [8].

136 E. Bayatmanesh, M. Akbari Tootkaboni/ Topology and its Applications 248 (2018) 128-137 The proof of the following theorem is similar to the proof of Theorem 2.7 in [9]. Theorem 3.15. Let S be a dense subsemigroup of ((0,∞),+) and A⊆S. Then A is a C-set near zero if and only if there is an idempotent in A¯∩J0⁢(S). Proof. Sufficiency. Let A*={x∈A:-x+A∈p}. By Lemma 4.14 in [8] if x∈A* then -x+A*∈p. For every δ∈(0,1) we define αδ⁢(F) and Hδ⁢(F) for F∈Pf⁢(𝒯0) by induction on |F| such that (1) if F,G∈Pf⁢(𝒯0) and F⊂G, then maxδ⁡(F)<minHδ⁡(G) and (2) if m∈ℕ,G1,…,Gm∈Pf⁢(𝒯0),G1⊂G2⊂⋯⊂Gn=F, and for all i∈{1,2,…,m},fi∈Gi, then

	
∑i=1m(αδ⁢(Gi)+∑t∈Hδ⁢(Gi)fi⁢(t))∈A*
	

If F={f}, since A* is a J-set near zero, pick αδ⁢(F)∈S∩(0,δ) and Hδ⁢(F)∈Pf⁢(ℕ) such that αδ⁢(F)+ ∑t∈Hδ⁢(Gi)fi⁢(t)∈A*.

Now assume that |F|>1 and αδ⁢(K) and Hδ⁢(K) have been chosen for all K with ∅≠K⊂F. Let r=max⁢⋃{Hδ⁢(K):∅≠K⊂F}. Let B=A*∩⋂{-(∑i=1m(αδ(Gi)+∑t∈Hδ⁢(Gi)fi(t))+A*:m∈ℕ, G1,G2,…,Gm∈Pf⁢(𝒯0),G1⊂G2⊂⋯⊂Gn=F, and (∀i∈{1,2,…,m})(fi∈Gi)}. Then B∈p so pick by Lemma 3.4,αδ⁢(F)∈S∩(0,δ) and Hδ⁢(F)∈Pf⁢(ℕ) such minHδ⁡(F)>r and for each f∈F,αδ⁢(F)+∑t∈Hδ⁢(F)f⁢(t)∈B.

Necessity. For each k∈ℕ, pick α1k and H1k as guaranteed by the definition of C-set near zero. For F∈Pf⁢(𝒯0) and k∈ℕ, let

	TF,k	={∑i=1m(α1k(Gi)+∑t∈H1k⁢(Gi)fi(t)):m∈ℕ,G1,G2,…,Gm∈Pf(𝒯0),	
		F⊂G1⊂G2⊂⋯⊂Gm, and (∀i∈{1,2,…,m})(fi∈Gi)}.	

Then each TF,k≠∅. Let Qk=⋂F∈Pf⁢(𝒯0)TF,k¯. We show first that Qk is semigroup. Given F,G∈Pf⁢(𝒯0), TF∪G,k⊆TF,k∩TG,k and so Qk≠∅. By Theorem 4.20 in [8],

	
(∀F∈Pf⁢(𝒯0))⁢(∀x∈TF,k)⁢(∃X∈Pf⁢(𝒯0))⁢(TX,k⊆-x+TF,k)
	

so let F∈Pf⁢(𝒯0) and let x∈TF,k. Pick m,G1,G2,…,Gm, and f1,f2,…,fm as in the definition of TF,k so that x=∑i=1m(α1k⁢(Gi)+∑t∈H1k⁢(Gi)fi⁢(t)). Then TGm,k⊆-x+TF,k.

We show that K⁢(Qk)⊆A¯∩J0⁢(S), so that any idempotent in K⁢(Qk) establishes the result. We have that each TF,k⊆A so Qk⊆A¯. Now let p∈K⁢(Qk) and let B∈p. We need to show that B is J-set near zero, so let F∈Pf⁢(𝒯0) be given. Let k=|F| and write F={f1,f2,…,fk}. Let 𝒟={G∈Pf⁢(𝒯0):F⊆G} and note that Qk=⋂G∈𝒟TG,k¯.

Let Y=Πi=1k⁢0+⁢(S). By Theorem 2.22 in [8], Y is a right topological semigroup and if x→∈Πi=1k⁢S, then λx→ is continuous. For G∈𝒟 and for k∈ℕ, let

	IG,k	={x→∈∏i=1kTG,k:(∃d∈S∩(0,1k))(∃L∈Pf(ℕ))	
	(x→	=(d+∑t∈Lf1(t),…,d+∑t∈Lfk(t)))}	




E. Bayatmanesh, M. Akbari Tootkaboni / Topology and its Applications 248 (2018) 128-137 137 and let EG,k=IG,k∪{(d,d,…,d):d∈TG,k}. Let Ik=⋂G∈𝒟c⁢lY⁢IG,k and let Ek=⋂G∈𝒟c⁢lY⁢EG,k. We claim that Ek is a subsemigroup of Πi=1l⁢Qk and that Ik is an ideal of Ek.

Trivially Ek⊆Πi=1l⁢Qk. Given G1,G2∈𝒟 we have that IG1∪G2,k⊆IG1,k∩IG2,k so to see that Ik≠∅ it suffices to let G∈𝒟 and show that IG,k≠∅. Pick G1,G2∈𝒟 such that G⊂G1⊂G2. Let L=H1k⁢(G2). Let d=α1k⁢(G1)+∑t∈H1k⁢(G1)f1⁢(t)+α1k⁢(G2). Then (d+∑t∈Lf1⁢(t),…,d+∑t∈Lfk⁢(t))∈IG,k.

Now let q→,r→∈Ek. We show that q→+r→∈Ek and, if either q→∈Ik or r→∈Ik, then q→+r→∈Ik. To this end, let G∈𝒟 and let U be an open neighborhood of q→+r→. Pick a neighborhood V of q→ such that V+r→⊆U. Pick x→∈V∩EG,k, with x→∈IG,k if q→∈Ik. For each i∈{1,2,…,k}, we have that xi∈TG,k so pick Xi∈𝒟 such that TXi,k⊆-xi+TG,k and let X=⋃i=1kXi. Pick a neighborhood W of r→ such that x→+W⊆U→. Pick y→∈W∩EX,k with y→∈IX,k if r→∈Ik. Then x→+y→∈EG,k and, if x→∈IG,k or y→∈IX,k, then x→+y→∈IG,k.

Recall that we have chosen p∈K⁢(Qk) and B∈p. We claim that p¯=(p,p,…,p)∈Ek. To see this let G∈𝒟 be given and let U be a neighborhood of p¯ in Y. Pick C∈p such that Πi=1k⁢C¯⊆U and pick d∈C∩TG,k. Then (d,d,…,d)∈U∩EG,k. By Theorem 2.23 in [8], we have that K⁢(Πi=1k⁢Qk)=Πi=1k⁢K⁢(Qk) so p¯∈Ek∩K⁢(Πi=1k⁢Qk). Therefore by Theorem 1.65 in [8] we have that p¯∈K⁢(Ek) and, since Ik is an ideal of Ek, we have that p¯∈Ik. Since Πi=1k⁢B¯ is a neighborhood of p¯, we have some x→∈Πi=1k⁢B¯∩Πi=1k⁢TF,k. Thus B is a J-set near zero as required.",1391.22003.tex,1410.54027.tex,None; Formula Manipulation; Different Presentation; Paraphrase

"(iii) ⇒ (iv) is clear. (iv) ⇒ (iii) Assume (iii) dose not hold. Then there exist graded submodyls X,Y of M such that X⊈Y and Y⊈X. This gives that there exist x∈H⁢(X)\Y and y∈H⁢(Y)\X. Hence R⁢x⊈R⁢y and R⁢y⊈R⁢x, which contradicts to (iv). Furthermore if R is ”quasi local it has been proved in [6. Lemma 5.22], that (i) and (iv) are equivalent.

Lemma 4 ([6. Lemma 5. 24]) M is a g.d R-module if and only if M(p) is a g.d R(p)- module for each graded prime (” maximal) ideal p of R. Lemma 5 For an R-module M the following statements are equivalent. (i) M is a g.d R-module. (ii) For each proper graded submodule N of M and each graded prime (” maximal) ideal p of R,N(p) is an ”irreducible submodule of M(p).

Proof. (i) ⇒ (ii). Let N be a proper graded submodule of M and let 𝔭 be a graded prime ideal of R which contains N:RM. Let N(p)=K(p)∩L(p). (Note that each graded submodule of M(𝔭) can be written as a homogeneous localization of some graded submodule of M at 𝔭.) By Lemma 4,M(𝔭) is a g.d module over the ”quasi local ring R(p). Therefore by Lemma 3, either L(𝔭)⊆K(p) or K(𝔭)⊆L(𝔭), i.e. either N(𝔭)=L(p) or N(p)=K(p). Thus N(p) is irreducible. (ii) ⇒ (i). In view of Lemmas 3 and 4 it is enough to prove that for each graded prime ideal 𝔭 of R, any two graded submodules of M(𝔭) are comparable. So let 𝔭 be a graded prime ideal of R and let K(𝔭),L(𝔭) be proper graded submodules of M(𝔭). We may assume that (M:RK∩L)⊆𝔭. So by assumption K(𝔭)∩L(𝔭)=(K∩L)(𝔭) is an ”irreducible submodule of M(p), so either K(p)⊆K(p)∩L(p) or L(p)⊆K(p)∩L(p). Consequently either K(p)⊆L(p) or L(p)⊆K(p) and the result follows.

Lemma 6 Let N be a graded submodule of M and p be a graded prime (”maximal) ideal of R. If N(p) is an * irreducible submodule of M(p), then N⁢(p) is an ”irreducible submodule of M. Furthermore if M is torsion free, the converse holds. Proof. (⇒). Let N⁢(𝔭)=K∩L for some graded submodules K,L of M. By N(𝔭)=K(𝔭)∩L(𝔭). Hence by assumption either N(𝔭)=K(𝔭) or N(𝔭)=L(𝔭), which gives that either N⁢(𝔭)=K or N⁢(𝔭)=L","(iii) ⇒ (iv) is clear. (iv) ⇒ (iii). Assume that (iii) does not hold.

Further, if R is *quasilocal, it was proved in Lemma 5.22 from [8] that (i) and (iv) are equivalent. Lemma 4 ([8, Lemma 5.24]). The module M is a g.d. R-module if and only if M(𝔭) is a g.d.

(Note that each graded submodule of M(𝔭) can be written as a homogeneous localization of some graded submodule of M at 𝔭.) By Lemma 4⁢M(𝔭) is a g.d. module over the *quasilocal ring R(𝔭).

In view of Lemmas 3 and 4 , it suffices to prove that, for each graded prime ideal 𝔭 of R, any two graded submodules of M(𝔭) are comparable. So, let 𝔭 be a graded prime ideal of R, and let K(𝔭) and L(𝔭) be proper graded submodules of M(𝔭). We may assume that (M:RK∩L)⊆𝔭. So by assumption K(𝔭)∩L(𝔭)=(K∩L)(𝔭) is a *irreducible submodule of M(𝔭), so either K(𝔭)⊆K(𝔭)∩L(𝔭). or L(𝔭)⊆K(𝔭)∩L(𝔭). Consequently, either K(𝔭)⊆L(𝔭) or L(𝔭)⊆K(𝔭), and the result follows.

Taking time-derivatives in (5) for Ψh(t ), Eq. 4 follows, provided again that (5) is true, so that (5) is the solution of (4) which is unique by using standard arguments from Picard-Lindeloff ’s theorem since the right- hand side of (1) is uniformly Lipschitz continuous. Then, by taking the first time-derivative of the second expression of (3) with the use of (4)-(5) in its right hand- side to separate x⁢(t) and x⁢(t-h), Eq. 1 holds for t≥0. III.

"Propositions 1. Assume that A is a Metzler matrix and A0=0. Then, there exists an input u:[0,t]→𝐑0+n of support (i.e. cl(Xt)), the closure of Xt:={τ∈[0,t] : u(τ)>0} being of non-zero measure for all time interval [0, t] of non-zero measure leading to xi⁢(t)≠0,∀i∈n¯⁢∀t>0, under identically zero initial conditions iff there is an integer k=k⁢(i)∈{0}∪n-1, dependent in general on i, such that the condition eiT⁢Ak⁢b≠0 holds for each i∈n¯. The above condition is also, a: - sufficient condition of positivity (provided that, in addition, c>0 ) and excitability independent of delay of Sh for any A0≥0; and - necessary and a sufficient condition of positivity (provided that, in addition, c ¿ 0) and excitability of S∞.

Proof. From Lemma 1, it suffices to consider constant inputs u⁢(t)=ku⁢(t≥0) to characterize excitability. For zero initial conditions, constant unity input and A0=0, the state-trajectory solution is given by:

	
x⁢(t,0,u)=∑k=0n-1βk(u)⁢(t)⁢Ak⁢b
	

from equation (3) where:

	
βk(u)⁢(t):=ku⁢(∫0tαk⁢(t-τ)⁢dτ)
	

and αk⁢(τ) are a set of n unique continuously differentiable and linearly independent real functions on any real interval (0, t) such that eAt=∑k=0n-1αk(t)Ak( De Leenheer and Aeyels, 2002). Note from the constraint:

	
α0⁢(0)⁢I+∑k=1n-1αk⁢(0)⁢Ak=[eAt]t=0=I
	

1583 Aeyels, 2002). Note from the constraint: α0⁢(0)=1 and αk⁢(0)=0 for k∈n-1¯. It is now proved that the set of functions βk(u)⁢(τ) are also linearly independent on any interval [0,t] of non-zero measure. Proceed by contradiction. Assume that they are linearly dependent. Thus, ∑k=0n-1λk⁢βk(u)⁢(τ)≡0 on τ∈[0,t] for some non-identically zero set of real scalar constants λk;k=0. Assume with no loss of generality that λ1≠0. Note that:

	
∑k=0n-1λk⁢βk(u)⁢(τ)≡0⇒∑k=0n-1λk⁢β˙k(u)⁢(τ)≡0  on ⁢(0,t)
	

From the definition of the functions βk(u), it follows that β˙k(u)⁢(τ)=2⁢αk⁢(0)-αk⁢(τ); k=0,1,…,n-1 which leads to β˙0(u)⁢(τ)=1+ku-α0⁢(τ) and β˙k(u)⁢(τ)=-αk⁢(τ) for

K k∈n-1¯ on (0,t) since α0⁢(0)=1 and αk⁢(0)=0 for k∈n-1¯. Replacing these 38,9 expressions into ∑k=0n-1λk⁢β˙k(u)⁢(τ)≡0, it follows that:

	
δ⁢(τ):=∑k=0n-1λk⁢αk⁢(τ)=(1+ku)⁢λ0
	

The following situations may occur: - λ0=0⇒δ⁢(τ)≡0 on (0,t) with λ1≠0. Thus, the functions αk⁢(τ) are not linearly independent on (0,t), so that they are not linearly independent on [0,t], what leads to a contradiction. - λ0≠0⇒δ⁢(τ)-(1+ku)⁢λ0≡0 on (0,t) with λ1≠0. Then, the set of functions α0⁢(t):=α0⁢(t)-(1+ku)⁢λ0,αk⁢(t),k∈n-1 are linearly dependent on (0,t). Since the set αk⁢(t);k=0,1,…,n-1 are independent of ku, but only dependent on A, that means that for almost all values of ku, the set αk⁢(t);k= 0,1,…,n-1 is not linearly independent on (0,t) and then on [0,t].

As a result, for some non-negative input of compact support on any interval [0,t] of non-zero measure (and, in particular, for almost any constant positive input on [0, t] one has:

	
xSαi⁢(τ,0,u)=[eiT⁢b,eiT⁢Ab,…,eiT⁢An-1⁢b]⁢[β0(u)⁢(τ),β1(u)⁢(τ),…,βn-1(u)⁢(τ)]T≠0
	

the i-th state component of the state trajectory solution of the system S∞ on (0, t] for all i∈n¯ iff eiT⁢Ak⁢b≠0 for some k=k⁢(i)∈{0}∪n-1¯ since βk(u)⁢(τ) are linearly independent on (0,t] for almost all non-negative input of compact support, and thus non-identically zero, on [0,t]. Thus, xS∞⁢(τ,0,u)≫0 on (0,t] for some admissible input of the given class. Since A is a Metzler matrix, S∞ is positive so that xS∞⁢(τ,0,u)≥0 on [0,t] for all t≥0. For zero initial conditions and any h∈[0,∞),xSh(τ,0,u)≥ xS∞⁢(τ,0,u)≥0 on [0, t] for all t≥0 for any admissible input and xSh⁢(τ,0,u)≥ xSρ∞τ,0,u)≫0 on [0,t] for all t≥0,∀h∈[0,∞) or some admissible input of the given class. Since A is Metzler and A0≥0, the above constraint still holds for any admissible function of initial conditions. Then, the system is positive and excitable independent of the delay. The condition is also a necessary and sufficient condition for positivity and excitability of S∞, i.e. for the case A0=0.

Propositions 2. (i) Sh is positive for a given delay h≥0 iff c>0,A0≥0,b>0 and:

	
[∫0teA⁢(t-τ)⁢(In+∫0τ-hA0⁢Ψh⁢(τ-h-s)⁢ds)⁢dτ]⁢b>0⁢ for all ⁢t>0
	

External positivity is characterized by changing the last expression by its pre-multiplication by cT. (ii) Sh is positive independent of the delay for any delay h≥0 if the last of the above conditions is replaced with eAt⁢b>0,∀t∈[t0,t0+T)⁢t≥t0, some finite t0≥0, some finite T>0 and any given h≥0. As a result, S0 and S∞ are also positive. External positivity independent of the delay is characterized by changing the condition eAt⁢b>0 by cT⁢eAtb>0. (iii) Sh being positive (respectively, externally positive) is excitable (respectively, externally excitable) for a given delay h≥0 iff:

[∫0teA⁢(t-τ)⁢(In+∫0τ-hA0⁢Ψh⁢(τ-h-s)⁢ds)⁢dτ]⁢b≫0  Excitable 
 dynamic systems  External positivity is characterized by changing the last expression by its with delays pre-multiplication by cT. (iv) Sh being positive (respectively, externally positive) is excitable (respectively, externally excitable) independent of the delay for any delay h≥0 iff (eAt⁢b)i>0 (respectively, (cT⁢eAt⁢b)i>0 ) for all i∈n¯,∀t∈[t0,t0+T), some finite t0≥0 and some finite T >0. As a result, S0 and S∞ are excitable (respectively, externally excitable). (v) S0 is positive iff ( A+A0) is a Metzler matrix, b>0 and c>0 (i.e. if Assumptions 1-3 hold) what is guaranteed by Sh being positive independent of the delay. In addition, it is excitable (respectively, externally excitable) iff (eAt⁢b)i>0 (respectively, (cT⁢eA⁢t⁢b)i>0 ) for all i∈n¯,∀t∈[t0,t0+T)⁢t≥t0, some finite t0≥0 and some finite T>0. S0 being excitable (respectively, externally excitable) is guaranteed by Sh being excitable independent of the delay. (vi) S∞ is positive iff A is a Metzler matrix, b >0 and c >0 (i.e. if Assumptions 1-3 hold with A0=0 ) what is guaranteed by Sh being positive independent of the delay. In addition, it is excitable (respectively, externally excitable) iff (e(A+A0)⁢t⁢b)i>0 (respectively, (cT⁢e(A+A0)⁢t)i>0 ) for all i∈n¯,∀t∈[t0,t0+T)⁢t≥t0, some finite t0≥0 and some finite T>0. S∞ being excitable (respectively, externally excitable) is guaranteed by Sh being excitable independent of the delay.

Proof. First note from Theorem 1 that for a unity step control the forced response of Sh :

	
x⁢(t)=[∫0teA⁢(t-τ)⁢(In+∫0τ-hA0⁢Ψh⁢(τ-h-ς)⁢ds)⁢dτ]⁢b
	

of Sh This ensures x⁢(t)>0 for any set of non-negative initial conditions and any non-negative control and any t>0 since A is a Metzler matrix (implying eAt⁢x0≥0 ) and ∫0τ-heA⁢(t-τ)⁢A0⁢x⁢(τ-h)⁢dτ≥0,b>0,c>0. Thus, the system is positive independent of the delay iff:

	
[∫0teA⁢(t-τ)⁢(In+∫0τ-hA0⁢Ψh⁢(τ-h-s)⁢ds)⁢dτ]⁢b>0⁢ for all ⁢t>0
	

If the above expression is, furthermore, 0≫ for some time interval then. all the state components are positive on such an interval and the system is excitable independent of the delay since positivity, respectively, excitability hold for any non-negative control, respectively, any control being positive over some finite interval of time. Properties (i)-(iii) have been proved. Properties (ii)-(iv) follow correspondingly by noting the following: A being a Metzler matrix is equivalent to eA⁢t>0 for all t≥0. Since eA⁢t is a fundamental matrix of the unforced system S∞, it is non-singular for all t≥0 then its kernel is zero so that eA⁢t⁢b=0 iff b=0. Since b>0 then (eA⁢t⁢b+eA⁢τ⁢A0⁢x⁢(τ-h))>0 and (eA⁢t⁢b+eA⁢τ⁢A0⁢x⁢(τ-h))≫0 are related to positivity and excitability, respectively, is equivalent to A being a Metzler matrix together with b>0 then the system is positive and either x2⁢(0+)>0 or x⁢(0+)≫0, respectively, for any positive constant control and then for any non-negative control being positive on some interval of non-zero measure for zero initial conditions. Then, the conditions given are

K equivalent to the joint Assumptions 1-3 and Sh is positive independent of the delay and 38,9 the first part has been proved. Also, note that for identically zero initial conditions (eA⁢t⁢b)i>0 for all i∈n¯,∀t∈[t0,t0+T), some finite t0≥0 and some finite T>0. for all i∈n¯⇔xi⁢(t,0,u)>0 for all i∈n¯,∀t∈[t0,t0+T), some finite t0≥0 and some finite T>0 so that Sh is excitable independent of the delay. Properties (v)-(vi) apply for particular systems (2a)-(2b) with delay zero or infinity. The proofs of positivity of the delay-free auxiliary systems S0 and S∞ are direct from equations (2a)-(2b) and the excitability follows in a similar way concerning y y,0,u)>0 for all i∈n¯, ∀t∈[t0,t0+T), some finite t0≥0 and some finite T>0. External positivity and external excitability follow by pre-multiplying directly the relevant conditions for positivity/excitability by cT.

Remark 2. Note that the condition (eAt)i>0 invoked in Propositions 2 for all i∈n¯ and is equivalent (although more difficult to test) to the previous excitability condition eiT⁢Ak⁢b≠0 for some integer k=k (i) ∈{0}∪n-1¯, dependent in general on i, for each i∈n¯. Note also that, since, the auxiliary system S∞ is delay-free and time-invariant if excitability holds then x⁢(0+,0,u⁢(t))≫0 for some admissible input so that t0=0 with no loss in generality equations (1)-(2).

Proposition 3. There exists an integer k=k⁢(i)∈{0}∪n-1¯, dependent in Proof. Since A(G)≥0 and b(G)≥0 by construction, eiT⁢A(G)k⁢b(G)≥0, depending in general on each i∈n¯: ⇒(A(G)k⁢b(G))i>0  for some k=k⁢(i)∈{0}∪n-1¯,∀i∈n¯ ⇒(∑k=0n-1A(G)k⁢b(G))i>0⇒∑k=0n-1A(G)k⁢b≫>0 Conversely:

	
∑k=0n-1A(G)kb≫0⇒(∑k=0n-1A(G)kb(G)k)i>0⇒(A(G)k)(G)i>0
	

for some k=k⁢(i)∈{0}∪n-1¯,∀i∈n¯. Proposition 4. Assume that Sh is positive independent of the delay. Then, it is excitable independent of the delay iff the associate system ShG is excitable independent of the delay, in particular, if any of the conditions below below, which mutually imply and are implied by all the remaining ones, hold: (1) eiT⁢Ak⁢b≠0 for some k=k (i) ∈{0}∪n-1¯, depending in general on i, for each i∈n¯. (2) eiT⁢A(G)k⁢b(G)>0 for some k=k (i) ∈{0}∪n-1¯, depending in general on i, for each i∈n¯. (3) For each i∈n¯,eiT⁢A(Gk⁢b(G)b>0 is not identically zero for all k∈{0}∪n-1¯. (4) ∑k=0n-1A(G)k⁢b≫0

Any of the above-equivalent conditions are necessary and sufficient for both S∞ and     Excitable S∞G to be excitable. Also, Sh and ShG are both output excitable independent of the delay if any of the dynamic systems equivalent constraints below, which mutually imply and are implied by all the with delays equivalent constraints (1’) cT⁢Ak⁢b≠0 for some k∈{0}∪n-1¯. (3’) For each i∈n¯,cT⁢A(G)k⁢b(G)>0 is not identically zero for all k∈{0}∪n-1¯. (4’) ∑k=0n-1cT⁢A(G)k⁢b≫0 (5’) There exist i∈n¯;k∈{0}∪n-1¯,j∈m¯ such that ciT⁢Ak⁢bj≠0 or, equivalently, ci(G)⁢T⁢A(G)k⁢bj(G)>0.

Any of the above-equivalent conditions are necessary and sufficient for both S∞ and S∞G to be output excitable. Proof. Note that ShG is positive by construction. Note also that b and b(G) have exactly the same zero components by construction of b(G) from b and that:

	
(eAt)ij=0⇔(eA(G))ij=0
	

1587 for any (off-diagonal) entry (i,j≠i)∈n¯×n¯ such that Ai⁢j=Ai⁢j(G)=0. As a result: (eA⁢t⁢b)i=0⇔(eA(G)⁢t⁢b(G))i=0  for any i∈n¯⇔(eA⁢t⁢b)i≠0⇔(eA(G)⁢b(G))i>0 for any i∈n¯⇔Sh, if positive, is excitable iff ShG (being always positive by construction) is excitable. The remaining of the proof follows directly from Propositions 1 to 3 . The conditions for (internal) excitability have been proven. Those for external excitability are close by replacing the Euclidean canonical unity vector by the output vector c.

Proposition 5. Assume that Sh is externally positive independent of the delay. Then, Sh is externally excitable independent of the delay iff ShG is externally excitable independent of the delay. Also, both Sh and ShG are both output excitable independent of the delay if any of the equivalent constraint below, which mutually imply and are implied by each other, hold: (1”) cT⁢Ak⁢b≠0 for some k∈{0}∪n-1¯. (3”) c(G)T⁢A(G)k⁢b(G) is not identically zero for all k∈{0}∪n-1¯. Any of the above-equivalent conditions are necessary and sufficient for both S∞ and S∞G to be output excitable. Proof. It is close to that of Proposition 3 by extending the proof of Proposition 1 by replacing equation (7) with:

	
yS⊗i⁢(τ,0,u)=[cT⁢b,cT⁢Ab,…,cT⁢An-1⁢b]⁢[β0(u)⁢(τ),β1(u)⁢(τ),…,βn-1(u)⁢(τ)]T≠0
	




K Propositions 6. Assume that S0 is positive. Then, it is excitable iff the associate 38,9 system S0G is excitable. Both S0 and S0G are excitable iff any of the equivalent constraint below, which mutually imply and are implied by all the remaining ones, hold: (1) eiT⁢(A+A0)k⁢b≠0 for some k=k (i) ∈{0}∪n-1¯, depending in general on i, for each i∈n¯. (2) eiT⁢(A(G)+A0(G))k⁢b(G)>0 for some k=k⁢(i)∈{0}∪n-1¯, depending in general on i, for each i∈n¯.

Then, it is externally excitable iff the associate system S0G is externally excitable. Both S0 and S0G are externally excitable iff any of the equivalent constraint below, which mutually imply and are implied by all the remaining ones, hold: (1”’I’) cT⁢(A+A0)k⁢b≠0 for some k∈{0}∪n-1¯.

(4′′′′) ∑k=0n-1C(G)T⁢(A(G)+A0(G))k⁢b>0 Excitability conditions dependent on the delay size are obtained below for the case when A and A0 commute. The basis of the proof is that in such a case, a finite set of (delay-dependent) more general real scalar linearly independent functions that the set αk⁢(t);k=0,1,…,n-1 used in the expansion eAt=∑k=0n-1αk⁢(t)⁢Ak are obtained to expand the evolution operator Ψh⁢(t) in the matrix products A0i⁢Aj.","Proposition 1: Assume that A is a Metzler matrix and A0=0. Then, there exists an input u:[0,t]→𝐑0+n of compact support (i.e. cl (Xt ), the closure of Xt:={τ∈[0,t]:u⁢(τ)>0} ) being of nonzero measure for all time interval [0,t] of nonzero measure leading to xi⁢(t)≠0,∀i∈n¯⁢∀t>0 under identically zero initial conditions iff there is an integer k=k⁢(i)∈{0}∪n-1¯, dependent in general on i, such that the condition eiT⁢Ak⁢b≠0 holds for each i∈n¯. - The above condition is also: (1) A sufficient condition of positivity (provided that, in addition, c >0 ) and excitability independent of delay of Sh for any A0≥0; and

DE LA SEN:TIME-DELAY SYSTEMS WITH POINT DELAYS 625 (2) A necessary and a sufficient condition of positivity (provided that, in addition, c >0 ) and excitability of S∞

Proof: From Lemma 1, it suffices to consider constant inputs u⁢(t)=ku⁢(t≥0) to characterize excitability. For zero initial conditions, constant unity input and A0=0, the state-trajectory solution is given by x⁢(t,0,u)=∑k=0n-1βk(u)⁢(t)⁢Ak⁢b from (3) where βk(u)⁢(t):=ku⁢(∫0tαk⁢(t-τ)⁢dτ) and αk⁢(τ) are a set of n unique continuously differentiable and linearly independent real functions on any real interval (0,t) such that eAt=∑k=0n-1αk(t)Ak( see [4]).

Note from the constraint α0⁢(0)⁢I+∑k=1n-1αk⁢(0)⁢Ak=[eAt]t=0=I,α0⁢(0)=1 and αk⁢(0)=0 for k∈n-1¯. It is now proved that the set of functions βk(u)⁢(τ) are also linearly independent on any interval [0, t] of nonzero measure. Proceed by contradiction. Assume that they are linearly dependent. Thus, ∑k=0n-1λk⁢βk(u)⁢(τ)≡0 on τ∈[0,t] for some non identically zero set of real scalar constants λk;k=0,. Assume with no loss of generality that λ1≠0. Note that ∑k=0n-1λk⁢βk(u)⁢(τ)≡0⇒∑k=0n-1λk⁢β˙k(u)⁢(τ)≡0 on (0,t). From the definition of the functions βk(u), it follows that β˙k(u)⁢(τ)=2⁢αk⁢(0)-αk⁢(τ); k=0,1,…,n-1 which leads to β˙0(u)⁢(τ)=1+ku-α0⁢(τ) and β˙k(u)⁢(τ)=-αk⁢(τ) for k∈n-1¯ on (0,t) since α0⁢(0)=1 and αk⁢(0)=0 for k∈n-1¯. Replacing these expressions into ∑k=0n-1λk⁢β˙k(u)⁢(τ)≡0, it follows that δ⁢(τ):=∑k=0n-1λk⁢αk⁢(τ)=(1+ku)⁢λ0. The following situations may occur: a) λ0=0⇒δ⁢(τ)≡0 on (0,t) with λ1≠0. Thus, the functions αk⁢(τ) are not linearly independent on (0,t), so that they are not linearly independent on [0,t], what leads to a contradiction. b) λ0≠0⇒δ⁢(τ)-(1+ku)⁢λ0≡0 on (0,t) with λ1≠0. Then the set of functions α0′⁢(t):=α0⁢(t)-(1+ku)⁢λ0, αk⁢(t),k∈n-1¯ are linearly dependent on (0,t). Since the set αk⁢(t);k=0,1,…,n-1 are independent of ku, but only dependent on A, that means that for almost all values of ku, the set αk⁢(t);k=0,1,…,n-1 is not linearly independent on (0,t) and then on [0,t].

As a result, for some nonnegative input of compact support on any interval [0,t] of nonzero measure (and, in particular, for almost any constant positive input on [0,t] ) one has

xSxi⁢(τ,0,u)=[eiT⁢b,eiT⁢Ab,…,eiT⁢An-1⁢b]⁢[β0(u)⁢(τ),β1(u)⁢(τ),…,βn-1(u)⁢(τ)]T≠0
	

i.e. the i-th state component of the state trajectory solution of the system S∞ on (0,t] for all i∈n¯ iff eiT⁢Ak⁢b≠0 for some k=k⁢(i)∈{0}∪n-1¯ since βk(u)⁢(τ) are linearly independent on (0,t] for almost all nonnegative input of compact support, and thus non identically zero, on [0,t]. Thus, xS∞⁢(τ,0,u)>>0 on (0,t] for some admissible input of the given class. Since A is a Metzler matrix, S∞ is positive so that xS∞⁢(τ,0,u)≥0 on [0,t] for all t≥0. For zero initial conditions and any h∈[0,∞), xsh⁢(τ,0,u)≥xs∞⁢(τ,0,u)≥0 on [0,t] for all t≥0 for any admissible input and xSh⁢(τ,0,u)≥xS∞⁢(τ,0,u)≫0 on [0,t] for all t≥0,∀h∈[0,∞) or some admissible input of the given class. Since A is Metzler and A0≥0, the above constraint still holds for any admissible function of initial conditions. Then, the system is positive and excitable independent of the delay. The condition is also a necessary and sufficient condition for positivity and excitability of S∞; i.e. for the case A =00.

Proof: First note from Theorem 1 that for a unity step control the forced response of Sh, x⁢(t)=[∫0teA⁢(t-τ)⁢(In+∫0τ-hA0⁢Ψh⁢(τ-h-ς)⁢dς)⁢dτ]⁢b. Then, x⁢(t)>0 for any set of nonnegative initial conditions, any nonnegative control and any t>0. This follows since b>0,c>0 and since A is a Metzler matrix what implying eAt⁢x0≥0 and ∫0τ-heA⁢(t-τ)⁢A0⁢x⁢(τ-h)⁢dτ≥0. Thus, the system is positive independent of the delay iff [∫0teA⁢(t-τ)⁢(In+∫0τ-hA0⁢Ψh⁢(τ-h-ς)⁢dς)⁢dτ]⁢b>0 for all t>0. If the above expression is, furthermore, >>0 for some time interval then. all the state components are positive on such an interval and the system is excitable independent of the delay since positivity, respectively, excitability hold for any nonnegative control, respectively, any control being positive over some finite interval of time. Properties (i)-(iii) have been proved. Properties (ii) - (iv) follow correspondingly by noting the following: A being a Metzler matrix is equivalent to eAt>0 for all t≥0. Since eAt is a fundamental matrix of the unforced system S∞, it is nonsingular for all t≥0 then its kernel is zero so that eAt⁢b=0 iff b=0. Since b>0 then (eA⁢t⁢b+eA⁢τ⁢A0⁢x⁢(τ-h))>0 and (eA⁢t⁢b+eA⁢τ⁢A0×(τ-h))>>0  are related to positivity and excitability, respectively, is equivalent to A being a Metzler matrix together with b>0 then the system is positive and either x⁢(0+)>0 or x⁢(0+)>>0, respectively, for any positive constant control and then for any nonnegative control being positive on some interval of nonzero measure for zero initial conditions. Then, the conditions given are equivalent to the joint Assumptions 1-3 and Sh is positive independent of the delay and the first part has been proved. Also, note that for identically zero initial conditions (eA⁢t⁢b)i>0 for all i∈n¯,∀t∈[t0,t0+T), some finite t0≥0 and some finite T>0. for all i∈n¯⇔xi⁢(t,0,u)>0 for all i∈n¯,∀t∈[t0,t0+T), some finite t0≥0 and some finite T>0.so that Sh is excitable independent of the delay.

The proofs of positivity of the delay-free auxiliary systems S0 and S∞ are direct from (2) and the above result for positivity independent of the delay . The proof related to external excitability follows in a similar way concerning y⁢(t,0,u)>0 for all i∈n¯,∀t∈[t0,t0+T), some finite t0≥0 and some finite T >0. External positivity and external excitability follow by pre-multiplying directly the relevant conditions for positivity/ excitability by cT.

Remark 2: Note that the condition (eAt⁢b)i>0 invoked in Proposition 2 for all i∈n¯ and is equivalent (although more difficult to test) to the previous excitability condition eiT⁢Ak⁢b≠0 for some integer k=k⁢(i)∈{0}∪n-1¯, dependent in general on i, for each i∈n¯. Note also that, since, the auxiliary system S∞ is delay-free and time-invariant if excitability holds then x⁢(0+,0,u⁢(t))>>0 for some admissible input so that t0=0 with no loss in generality, [1-2].

Note that doma=doma*=:D and a*⁢(ej)=j+1⁢ej+1. Besides that for any α∈ℂ there exists a unique (up to multiplying by θ where |θ|=1) normed eigenvector ca corresponding to the eigenvalue α. Namely, (cα,ej)=e-|α|22⁢αjj! and these cα are called coherent states. Note also that [a,a*]=I and the operator a is irreducible.

Definition 1. An orthogonal projection P (that is, P is a bounded operator such that P=P2=P*) is called admissible if the subspace DP:={x∈D;Px∈ D} is dense in H. In this case the operator A:=[a,P] is densely defined. Proposition 2. There is a simple criterion of admissibility: an orthogonal projection P:H→H is admissible if and only if the spaces D∩im⁡P and D∩ker⁡P are dense in im⁢P and in ker⁡P respectively.

Noncommutative Grassmannian U⁢(1) Sigma-model and Bargmann-Fock Space 43 Therefore projections P and I-P are admissible together. Also a projection P with dim(imP)<∞( or dim(kerP)<∞) is admissible if and only if im⁡P⊂D (respectively ker⁡P⊂D ).

Definition 3. Let a projection P be admissible. Then P is said to be a projection of finite energy if the operator A=[a,P] is extended from DP to the whole H by continuity and this extension is a Hilbert-Schmidt operator. In this case we define the energy of P by the formula

	
E⁢(P):=∥A∥H⁢S2=∥[a,P]∥H⁢S2
	

where ∥⋅∥H⁢S is the Hilbert-Schmidt norm. Otherwise an admissible P is called a projection of infinite energy and E⁢(P):=∞. Note that E⁢(P)=E⁢(I-P).","2.

We say that an orthogonal projector P:H→H (i.e., such that P=P2=P* ) is admissible if the subspace DP:={x∈D:P⁢x∈D} is dense in H. This means that the operator A:=[a,P] is densely defined.

There is a simple admissibility criterion: an orthogonal projector P:H→H is admissible if and only if the spaces D∩im⁡P and D∩ker⁡P are respectively dense in im P and in ker P. It follows from this criterion that the admissibility of a projector P is equivalent to the admissibility of I-P.

Hence (a⁢h,a⁢p) is extended to a bounded linear functional of h on the whole H. Thus the operator a* is defined at the vector a⁢p and (12) can be rewritten as the following condition

Two-Dimensional Inversion Algorithms,Multi-Dimensional Inversion Formula,1241.65114.tex,1266.65214.tex,Paraphrase
"Starting from a function of two variables, f⁢(t1,t2), we can construct the Laplace transform in a twostep process, applying the one-dimensional construction twice: first, consider t2 a constant, and apply (1) with the complex variable s1 to f to get the onedimensional Laplace transform

	
f^⁢(s1,t2)≡∫0∞e-s1⁢t1⁢f⁢(t1,t2)⁢𝑑t1,
	

which we assume is well defined for Re⁡(s1)>0. Then consider the complex variable s1 a constant, and apply (1) a second time with the complex variable s2 to get the two-dimensional Laplace transform

	
f~⁢(s1,s2)≡∫0∞e-s2⁢t2⁢f^⁢(s1,t2)⁢𝑑t2,
	

which we assume is well defined for Re⁡(s1)>0 and Re⁡(s2)>0.

Likewise, two-dimensional transform inversion can be considered a two-step process, applying the onedimensional inversion formula (2) twice: For specified argument pair (t1,t2), first invert f~⁢(s1,s2) with respect to s2 (inner loop), regarding s1 as constant, to get an approximation for f^⁢(s1,t2). Then invert the approximation for f^⁢(s1,t2) with respect to s1 (outer loop), regarding t2 as constant, getting the desired approximation for f⁢(t1,t2).

It is straightforward to extend the unified framework to two dimensions: Following the two-step procedure just described, we have

	
f^⁢(s1,t2)≈f^n2⁢(s1,t2)≡1t2⁢∑k2=0n2ωk2′⁢f~⁢(s1,αk2′t2)
	

and

	
f⁢(t1,t2)≈fn1⁢(t1,t2)≡1t1⁢∑k1=0n1ωk1⁢f^n2⁢(αk1t1,t2).
	

Combining (24) and (27), we obtain the general form for the inversion

	f⁢(t1,t2)	≈fn1,n2⁢(t1,t2)	
		≡1t1⁢t2⁢∑k1=0n1ωk1⁢∑k2=0n2ωk2′⁢f~⁢(αk1t1,αk2′t2),	

as in (5).

We can justify the two-dimensional inversion formula the same way we did for the one-dimensional case in Section 2. When we do, we see that the twodimensional objects are just the product of the two corresponding one-dimensional objects. For example, the two-dimensional scaled delta function is just the product of the two one-dimensional delta functions. Moreover, the two-dimensional linear combination of exponentials is the product of the two one-dimensional linear combinations of exponentials. Thus the Laplace transforms are the products of the two one-dimensional Laplace transforms. Hence the one-dimensional Padé approximation can be applied to each dimension in the two-dimensional case.

As a consequence of the general two-dimensional framework in (26), we can apply the three onedimensional routines in Sections 4,5, and 6 in any combination to obtain nine different candidate twodimensional routines. Even though the Gaver-Stehfest routine works only with real weights and nodes, we can apply the Gaver-Stehfest routine in the inner loop with any of these other procedures, because the Gaver-Stehfest routine extends to complex-valued functions via (17) and (18).

From the experience in Choudhury et al. (1997), we know that it may be necessary to do extra work for the inner loop to ensure that the intermediate function f^⁢(s1,t2) has sufficient accuracy to perform the calculation in the outer loop accurately. Thus, we anticipate that we may need n2>n1. However, for ease of use, it is desirable to have only one parameter n, as in the one-dimensional case. We can achieve that by letting

	
n1=n  and  n2=c⁢n
	

for a fixed parameter c, which depends on the specific routines used in the inner and outer loops. That is assuming that the system precision required in the outer loop and the accuracy produced in the inner loop both grow proportionally to n, which experience shows to be approximately so with the algorithms considered here.

What is surprising is that it often suffices to have c=1. For the specific two-dimensional algorithms we consider, built from the three one-dimensional algorithms 𝒢,ℰ, and 𝒯, we find that c=1 often suffices; see Section 8.","Starting from a function of two variables, f⁢(t1;t2), we can construct the Laplace transform in a two-step process, applying the one-dimensional construction twice: First, consider t2 a constant, and apply (1) with the complex variable s1 to f to get the one-dimensional Laplace transform

	
f^⁢(s1,s2)≡∫0∞e-s1⁢t1⁢f⁢(t1,t2)⁢𝑑t1
	

which we assume is well defined for Re⁡(s1)>0. Then consider the complex variable s1 a constant, and apply (1) a second time with the complex variable s2 to get the two-dimensional Laplace transform

	
f~⁢(s1,s2)≡∫0∞e-s2⁢t2⁢f⁢(s1,s2)⁢𝑑t2,
	

which we assume is well defined for Re⁡(s1)>0 and Re⁡(s2)>0. Likewise, two-dimensional transform inversion can be considered a two-step process, applying the one-dimensional inversion formula (2) twice: For specified argument pair (t1;t2), first invert f~(s1; s2) with respect to s2 (inner loop), regarding s1 as constant, to get an approximation for f^⁢(s1;t2). Then invert the approximation for f^⁢(s1;t2) with respect to s1 (outer loop), regarding t2 as constant, getting the desired approximation for f⁢(t1;t2). 681

Shobha Lal & Rajesh Saxena It is straightforward to extend the unified framework to two dimensions: Following the twostep procedure just described, we have

	
f^⁢(s1,t2)≈f^2⁢(s1,t2)≡1t2⁢∑k2=0n2ωk2′⁢f~⁢(s1,αk2′t2)
	

and

	
f⁢(t1,t2)≈fn1⁢(t1,t2)≡1t1⁢∑k1=0n1ωk1⁢f^n2⁢(αk1t1,t2)
	

Combining (24) and (27), we obtain the general form for the inversion

	
f⁢(t1,t2)≈fn1,n2⁢(t1,t2)≡1t1⁢t2⁢∑k1=0n1ωk1⁢∑k2=0n2ωk2′⁢f~⁢(αk1t1,αk2′t2)
	

as⁡in⁡(5) We can justify the two-dimensional inversion formula the same way we did for the onedimensional case in Section 2. When we do, we see that the two-dimensional objects are just the product of the two corresponding one-dimensional objects. For example, the two-dimensional scaled delta function is just the product of the two one-dimensional delta functions. Moreover, the twodimensional linear combination of exponentials is the product of the two one-dimensional linear combinations of exponentials. Thus the Laplace transforms are the products of the two one-dimensional Laplace transforms. Hence the one-dimensional Pade approximation can be applied to each dimension in the two-dimensional case.

As a consequence of the general two-dimensional framework in (26), we can apply the three one-dimensional routines in Sections 4, 5 and 6 in any combination to obtain nine different candidate two-dimensional routines. Even though the Gaver-Stehfest routine works only with real weights and nodes, we can apply the Gaver-Stehfest routine in the inner loop with any of these other procedures, because the Gaver-Stehfest routine extends to complex-valued functions via (17) and (18).

From the experience in Choudhury, Lucantoni and Whitt (1997), we know that it may be necessary to do extra work for the inner loop to ensure that the intermediate function f^(s1; t2) has sufficient accuracy to accurately perform the calculation in the outer loop. Thus, we anticipate that we may need n2>n1. However, for ease of use, it is desirable to have only one parameter n, as in the one-dimensional case. We can achieve that by letting

	
n1=n⁢ and ⁢n2=c⁢n
	

for a fixed parameter c, which depends on the specific routines used in the inner and outer loops. That is assuming that the system precision required in the outer loop and the accuracy produced in the inner loop both grow proportionally to n, which experience shows to be approximately so with the algorithms considered here.

25 Conclusions

In this paper we have proposed the general unified framework in (2) for numerically inverting Laplace transforms. We pointed out that the flexible framework makes it possible to perform optimization in order to select specific inversion routines for special classes of functions, but it remains to pursue that approach. In Sections 4, 5, and 6 we showed that the Gaver-Stehfest method, 𝒢, the Fourier-series method with Euler summation, ℰ, and a version of Talbot’s method, 𝒯, all fit into this common framework.

In Section 3 we observed that the unified framework extends directly to yield a corresponding framework for numerically inverting multidimensional Laplace transforms. In Section 8 we observed that the three specific one-dimensional algorithms we introduced in the framework (2) produce nine candidate two-dimensional algorithms, all in the twodimensional framework (5). In Sections 7 and 9 we reported results on the performance of the algorithms. In Section 7 we concluded that the Euler and Talbot one-dimensional algorithms are about equally efficient, as measured by the ratio of the number of significant digits produced to the number of digits of machine precision required, while these two are about 1.5 times as efficient as the Gaver-Stehfest one-dimensional algorithm. However, the Gaver-Stehfest algorithm has the advantage of working with only real numbers.

Investigations of the two-dimensional algorithms in Section 9 indicate that all nine combinations of the three one-dimensional routines can be effective twodimensional algorithms. However, we encountered difficulties calculating values of two-dimensional transforms when the Talbot method 𝒯 is used in the inner loop, because of problems evaluating transforms for conjugate s. Initial results indicate that the best two-dimensional algorithms are the combinations 𝒯⁢𝒢,ℰ⁢𝒢 and 𝒯⁢ℰ. Evidently it can be advantageous to use different one-dimensional routines in the inner and outer loops.

Much remains to be done. First, as is often the case with numerical transform inversion (and many other numerical methods), a systematic error analysis is lacking. The bounds for the Fourier-series method with Euler summation in Abate and Whitt (1995), O’Cinneide (1997), and Sakurai (2004) are the exception. There is a need for much more testing. It remains to understand better how the algorithms perform on different classes of transforms. More work is needed, extending Abate and Valko (2004), to understand how the algorithm performance depends on the structure of the transform. It remains to see what combinations of the three one-dimensional routines will be especially effective for high-dimensional inversion problems.

It also remains to consider other kinds of transforms. We have found that essentially the same unified framework applies to generating functions; we plan to elaborate on that elsewhere. Thus, just as in Choudhury et al. (1994a), the unified framework will apply to multidimensional transforms, where each dimension may involve either a generating function or a Laplace transform.","However, there is a difficulty with the Talbot algorithm, which does not have to do with efficiency.

The necessity in statement (ii) follows directly from Proposition 2.5. The proof of sufficiency is similar to the proof of Proposition 2.10; let K be a commutatorinvariant subgroup of G and if minG⁡(K⁢[p]) is finite, say m, then with the aid of Proposition 2.8 we may write K⁢[p]=(pm⁢G)⁢[p], as required. Otherwise, if we have minG⁡(K⁢[p])≥ω, then clearly K⁢[p]≤pω⁢G≤pn⁢G. We assert that K⁢[p] is a commutator-invariant subgroup of pn⁢G. This follows as in Proposition 2.10 using Lemma 2.11 to deduce that endomorphisms of pn⁢G extend to endomorphisms of G. Since pn⁢G is commutator socle-regular, we have K⁢[p]=(pα⁢(pn⁢G))⁢[p] for some ordinal α. Consequently, K⁢[p]=(pn+α⁢G)⁢[p] and G is commutator socleregular, as desired.

We will establish (iii) by first considering the case α=ω. In this special case the proof follows from Proposition 2.10 and the observation that as G/pω⁢G is to-

790 P. Danchev and B. Goldsmith tally projective, it follows from [15, Theorem 2] that every endomorphism of pω⁢G extends to an endomorphism of G, thereby giving the extension property required to apply Proposition 2.10.

Suppose now the ordinal α has the form α=ω⋅m for some 1<m<ω. Since the group pα⁢G=pω⋅m⁢G=pω⁢(pω⋅(m-1)⁢G) is commutator socle-regular and the quotient G/pα⁢G=G/pω⋅m⁢G is totally projective, whence so is the quotient pω⋅(m-1)⁢(G/pα⁢G)=pω⋅(m-1)⁢G/pω⋅m⁢G, we apply the preceding case α=ω for A=pω⋅(m-1)⁢G to derive that pω⋅(m-1)⁢G is commutator socle-regular. Moreover, as G/pα⁢G is totally projective so also is G/pβ⁢G for any β<α. Thus, after m-1 steps, we deduce that pω⁢G is commutator socle-regular and G/pω⁢G is a direct sum of cyclic groups. Again by what we have shown in the previous paragraph, G will be commutator socle-regular, finishing this case.

Finally, consider the case where α=ω⋅m+n with m,n<ω. Since the group pα⁢G=pω⋅m+n⁢G=pn⁢(pω⋅m⁢G) is commutator socle-regular, we can conclude from (ii) above that the same holds for pω⋅m⁢G. As already observed, if G/pα⁢G is totally projective, then so also is G/pω⋅m⁢G. We therefore may employ the previous step to conclude that G is commutator socle-regular, indeed. Part (iv) follows immediately from (iii) by choosing α to be the length of G.","Proof. Statement (i) follows immediately from Proposition 5 and the observation that in both cases the endomorphisms of Hω⁢(M) are scalars and hence give rise in a natural way to the desired homomorphism.

The necessity in statement (ii) follows directly from Proposition 2. The proof of sufficiency is similar to the proof of Proposition 5; let N be a commutator invariant submodule of M, and if we suppose that inf⁡(Soc⁡(N)) is finite, k, then with the aid of Proposition 3 we may write Soc⁡(N)=Soc⁡(Hk⁢(M)), as desired. Otherwise, if we have inf⁡(Soc⁡(N))≥ω, then clearly Soc⁡(N)⊆ Hω⁢(M)⊆Hn⁢(M). We assert that Soc⁡(N) is a commutator invariant submodule of Hn⁢(M). This follows as Proposition 5 uses Lemma 1 to deduce that endomorphisms of Hn⁢(M) extend to endomorphisms of M. Since Hn⁢(M) is commutator socle-regular, we have Soc⁡(N)=Soc⁡(Hσ⁢(Hn⁢(M))) for some ordinal σ. Consequently, Soc⁡(N)=Soc⁡(Hn+σ⁢(M)) and M is commutator socle-regular, as required.

We will establish (iii) by first considering the case σ=ω. In this special case the proof follows from Proposition 5 and the observation that as M/Hω⁢(M) is totally projective, it follows that every endomorphism of Hω⁢(M) extends to an endomorphism of M, thereby giving the extension property required to apply Proposition 5.

Suppose now the ordinal σ has the form σ=ω⋅k for some 1<k< ω. Since the Q⁢T⁢A⁢G-module Hσ⁢(M)=Hω⋅k⁢(M)=Hω⁢(Hω⋅(k-1)⁢(M)) is commutator socle-regular and the quotient M/Hσ⁢(M)=M/Hω⋅k⁢(M) is totally projective, whence so is the quotient

	
Hω⋅(k-1)⁢(M/Hσ⁢(M))=Hω⋅(k-1)⁢(M)/Hω⋅k⁢(M),
	

we apply the preceding case σ=ω for K=Hω⋅(k-1)⁢(M) to derive that Hω⋅(k-1)⁢(M) is commutator socle-regular. Moreover, as M/Hσ⁢(M) is totally projective so is M/Hτ⁢(M) for any τ<σ. Thus, after k-1 steps, we deduce that Hω⁢(M) is commutator socle-regular and M/Hω⁢(M) is a direct sum of uniserial modules. Again by what we have shown in the previous paragraph, M will be commutator socle-regular, finishing this case.

Finally, consider the case where σ=ω⋅k+n with k,n<ω. Since the Q⁢T⁢A⁢G-module Hσ⁢(M)=Hω⋅k+n⁢(M)=Hn⁢(Hω⋅k⁢(M)) is commutator socleregular, we can conclude from (i⁢i) above that the same holds for Hω⋅k⁢(M). As already observed, if M/Hσ⁢(M) is totally projective, then so is M/Hω.k⁢(M). We therefore may employ the previous step to conclude that M is commutator socle-regular, indeed.

So, supposing minA⁡(X⁢[p]) is infinite, then X⁢[p]≤(pω⁢A)⁢[p]=(pω⁢G)⁢[p], as H is separable. However, X is a commutator invariant subgroup of A and so X⁢[p] is a commutator invariant subgroup of A which is actually contained in G.

Suppose that P is commutator socle-regular and L is a commutator invariant submodule of M. If inf⁡(Soc⁡(L)) is finite, then by Proposition 3, we have Soc⁡(L)=Soc⁡(Hn⁢(M)) for some finite n. So, supposing inf⁡(Soc⁡(L)) is infinite, then Soc⁡(L)⊆Soc⁡(Hω⁢(M))=Soc⁡(Hω⁢(P)), as Q is separable. However, L is a commutator invariant submodule of M and so Soc⁡(L) is a commutator invariant submodule of M which is actually contained in P. Since endomorphisms of P extend trivially to endomorphisms of M, it is easy to see that Soc⁡(L) is actually a commutator invariant submodule of M, and so Soc⁡(L)=Soc⁡(Hσ⁢(P)) for some ordinal σ. Thus Soc⁡(Hσ⁢(P))⊆Soc⁡(Hω⁢(P)) and so σ≥ω. It follows immediately that Soc⁡(L)=Soc⁡(Hσ⁢(P))=Soc⁡(Hσ⁢(M)), since Hσ⁢(Q)=0.

Conversely, suppose that M is commutator socle-regular and let N be an arbitrary commutator invariant submodule of P. As before, if inf (Soc⁡(N)) is finite, then Proposition 3 assures that Soc⁡(N)=Soc⁡(Hn⁢(P)) for some positive integer n.

"2 Splitting OF p IN CUbiC NUMBER Fields

Let K be a cubic number field, with class number hK=3. Then the class group 𝒞⁢(K) is isomorphic to ℤ3, where 0 corresponds to the principal ideal class, and 1 and 2 correspond to different non-principal ideal classes. Consider how a prime p in ℤ can split in K. Excluding the finite number of primes which ramify, the following are the only possibilities

i) p⁢𝒪K is inert, with f⁢(p⁢𝒪K∣p)=3,

ii) p⁢𝒪K=𝔭1⁢𝔮1 with f⁢(𝔭1∣p)=1 and f⁢(𝔮1∣p)=2, or

iii) p⁢𝒪K=𝔭1⁢𝔭2⁢𝔭3 with f⁢(𝔭i∣p)=1, so p⁢𝒪K splits completely.

Notice that case ii) above can only occur if the field K/ℚ is non-Galois since the two primes have different inertial degrees.

Regardless of how the prime (p) splits in K, the factorisation must produce a consistent equation in the class group of K. Case i) is trivial in this regard, because the ideal p⁢𝒪k is principal, and there is actually no equation to satisfy. Case ii) is almost as trivial; since p⁢𝒪k is principal, we get [𝔭1]=[𝔮1]-1 in 𝒞⁢(K). Case iii) is more interesting since the following equations hold in the class group

	0	=0+0+0	
		=1+1+1	
		=2+2+2	
		=0+1+2.	

A priori nothing seems to prevent any of the four cases occurring when the prime p splits completely, but curiously the last case appears not to occur in certain number fields.

Definition 1.1 (Homogeneous splitting). Let K be a cubic number field, with class number hK=3. Let p∈ℤ be a prime which does not ramify in K. I shall say K has homogeneous splitting if complete splitting p⁢𝒪K=𝔭1⁢𝔭2⁢𝔭3 implies [𝔭1]=[𝔭2]=[𝔭3] in 𝒞⁢(K). Otherwise K has non-homogeneous splitting.

This write-up stems from the initial curious observation that ℚ⁢(73) appears to have homogeneous splitting. This observation appeared whilst investigating the representation of primes by ternary cubic forms, and relating this to the ideal classes in a cubic number field in analogy with the quadratic case. This homogeneous splitting was noted in connection with the splitting of the defining polynomial of the Hilbert class field of ℚ⁢(73), specifically the apparent lack of splitting into factors of degree (1,1,1,3,3) modulo p.

Once the splitting field of the Hilbert class field of ℚ⁢(73) is known, homogeneous splitting can be proven easily. There is a condition on the degree of this splitting field which implies homogeneous splitting, and conversely if this condition fails, I can prove non-homogeneous splitting must occur using the Chebotarev density theorem.

3 Hilbert Class Field of K, AND its SPlitting Field

For a field K as above, consider the Hilbert class field H. We know that hK=3, and Gal⁡(H/K)≅𝒞⁢(K) which means H/K has degree 3 and H/ℚ has degree 9 .

If K/ℚ is Galois, then a standard argument shows that H/ℚ is also Galois. H is the maximal unramified Abelian extension of K, and any conjugate of H/ℚ is also an unramified Abelian extension of K. Therefore any conjugate of H/ℚ is contained in H, and for degree reasons is in fact equal. This means H/ℚ is equal to all its conjugates, and so is Galois.

If K/ℚ is non-Galois, then H/ℚ cannot be Galois. If H/ℚ were Galois, then G:=Gal⁡(H/ℚ)≅ ℤ3×ℤ3 or ≅ℤ9 by the classification of groups of order p2. So K/ℚ would correspond to a subgroup of G=Gal⁡(H/ℚ) of index 3. Such a subgroup would necessarily be normal, since G is Abelian. But normal subgroups of the Galois group correspond to Galois extensions of the base field, which means K/ℚ would be Galois.

Consider now the splitting field S of the Hilbert class field H/ℚ, which fits into the following field diagram.

Proposition 2.1. The degree of the splitting field S/H is either 1,2,6 or 18 . This corresponds to degrees 9,18,54 or 162 as an extension of ℚ.

Proof. The degree of S/H is 1 if and only if H/ℚ is Galois, which is if and only if K/ℚ itself is Galois. We can therefore assume that K/ℚ, and H/ℚ are non-Galois, and show one of the remaining cases holds.

The splitting field of K/ℚ has degree 2 over K and degree 6 over ℚ. This is a standard result, namely let f⁢(x) is the defining polynomial of K, with roots α1,α2,α3. Then K is obtained by attaching α1, but since K is not Galois, α2,α3∉K. Dividing out f⁢(x)/(x-α1) gives an irreducible quadratic polynomial over K which has roots α2,α3. Attaching α2 to K gives K~ a degree 2 extension of K, a degree 6 extension of ℚ. And then already α3∈K~, since α2⁢α3,α2∈K~. So f⁢(x) splits completely in K~, and this is the splitting field of K. Consider the extension H/K, and find some α1∈H\K. Since H/K is Galois, we get conjugates α2:=α1σ,α3:=α1σ2 in H, where Gal⁡(H/K)≅ℤ3 is generated by σ.

Let h⁢(x) be the defining polynomial for H/ℚ, with roots α1,…,α9. Since H/K is Galois, each conjugate H′/K′ will also be Galois, where K′ is one of the conjugates of K/ℚ. This means there are 3 conjugates H,H′,H′′, over K,K′,K′′ respectively, and we can therefore group the roots such that α1,2,3∈H,α4,5,6∈H′ and α7,8,9∈H′′. Consider the polynomial g⁢(x)= (x-α1)⁢(x-α2)⁢(x-α3). Since the α1,2,3 are conjugates over K, this polynomial is in K⁢[x], and is irreducible here since α1∉K. Therefore g⁢(x) is the minimal polynomial for α1 over K.

Since h⁢(x) is a polynomial over K (in fact ℚ ) with root α1, and g⁢(x) is the minimal polynomial for α1 over K, the standard argument using the division algorithm shows g∣h in K⁢[x]. If g′⁢(x) is the minimal polynomial for α4 over K′, and g′′⁢(x) for α7 over K′′, we have g′∣h in K′⁢[x] and g′′∣h in K′′⁢[x] by exactly the same argument.

Consider now the splitting field K~ of K. The splitting field of H/ℚ, whatever it is, must contain K~, so let’s start here. Furthermore, K~ contains K,K′,K′′. So in K~⁢[x] the polynomial h⁢(x) of H/ℚ splits into three cubic factors as h⁢(x)=g⁢(x)⁢g′⁢(x)⁢g′′⁢(x).

We obtain the splitting field of H/ℚ by making the factors g⁢(x),g′⁢(x) and g′′⁢(x) split completely. And since H/K,H′/K′,H′′/K′′ are Galois, attaching one root of g,g′,g′′ makes that factor split completely. We must attach first the root α1 of g⁢(x) to K~ get a field F1:=K~⁢(α1) containing H, wherein g⁢(x) has split completely. Then F1/ℚ has degree 6×3=18. If this is not the splitting field, one of g′,g′′ has no split. Say, by reordering the roots, it is g′. Attach α4 to F1 to get F2:=K~⁢(α1,α4). Then F2/ℚ has degree 18×3=54. If this is still not the splitting field g′′ has not split, so attach α7 to F2 to get F3:=K~⁢(α1,α4,α7). Then F3/ℚ has degree 54×3=162. At this point the polynomial f⁢(x) definitely has split completely, so we have found the splitting field.

If S is the splitting field of L/ℚ, then by the tower law [S:L][L:ℚ]=[S:ℚ], so that [S:L]=[S:ℚ]/9. If S=F1, then [S:L]=18/9=2. If S=F2, then [S:L]=54/9=6. Finally if S=F3, then [S:L]=162/9=18. This proves the proposition.

Remark 2.2. It appears generally that [S:L]=2, or [S:L]=6. If one were to study the situation in the Proposition 2.1 in greater detail, one could presumably establish that once g,g′ split, the factor g′′ must also split automatically. This would eliminate the case where [S:L]=18. But as yet, this would seem to take more effort than I am willing to make.

4 Splitting of p in the Hilbert class field H of K

Now we look at how the prime p can splits in K, and what impact this has on the splitting on the Hilbert class field H. We shall analyse what happens with the factorisation in cases i) to iii), and the subcases of these where the ideals in the factorisation fall into the various different ideal classes in 𝒞⁢(K). Using Dedekind’s theorem, we will relate these to the factorisation modulo p of the polynomials fK⁢(x) defining K/ℚ, and fH⁢(x) defining the Hilbert class field H/ℚ. Recall that the degrees of the irreducible factors of fK⁢(x) modulo p are the inertial degrees of the prime ideals above p in K.

𝒑 is inert in 𝑲 : So p⁢𝒪K is prime, with f⁢(p⁢𝒪K∣p)=3. Therefore fK⁢(x) is irreducible modulo p. The ideal p⁢𝒪 is principal, so splits completely in the Hilbert class field as p⁢𝒪H=𝔓1⁢𝔓2⁢𝔓3, with f⁢(𝔓i∣p⁢𝒪H)=1. Multiplicativity of f means f⁢(𝔓i∣p)=3, so fH⁢(x) factors with degrees (3,3,3) modulo p.

p⁢𝒪𝑲=𝔭1⁢𝔮𝟏 in 𝑲 : We have f⁢(𝔭1∣p)=1 and f⁢(𝔮1∣p)=2, so modulo p⁢fK⁢(x) factors with degrees (1,2). Since [𝔭1]=[𝔮1]-1, either both ideals are principal, or both ideals are non-principal. If 𝔭1 is principal, then it splits completely in H/K as 𝔭1⁢𝒪H=𝔓1⁢𝔓2⁢𝔓3 with f⁢(𝔓i∣𝔭1)=1. Since 𝔮1 is also principal, we get complete splitting in H/K as 𝔮1=𝔔1⁢𝔔2⁢𝔔3 with f⁢(𝔔i∣𝔮1)=1. Multiplicativity means f⁢(𝔔i∣p)=2 and f⁢(𝔓i∣p)=1. Therefore fH⁢(x) factors with degrees (1,1,1,2,2,2) modulo p.

If 𝔭1 is non-principal, it does not split completely in H/K. But since H/K is Galois with prime degree, the only other possibility is that 𝔭1 is inert. Therefore 𝔭1⁢𝒪H is prime in L, with f⁢(𝔭1⁢𝒪H∣𝔭1)=3. And 𝔮1⁢𝒪H, similarly, is prime in L with f⁢(𝔮1⁢𝒪H∣𝔮1)=3. Multiplicativity means f⁢(𝔭1⁢𝒪∣p)=3 and f⁢(𝔮1⁢𝒪H∣p)=6. Therefore fH⁢(x) factors with degrees (3,6) modulo p.

p⁢𝒪𝑲=𝔭1⁢𝔭2⁢𝔭3 in 𝑲 : So p splits completely in K. We have f⁢(𝔭i∣p)=1, so fK⁢(x) factors with degrees (1,1,1) modulo p. From the previous discussion there are four cases to consider, where all 𝔭i are principal; all 𝔭i are non-principal of class 1 ; all 𝔭i are non-principal of class 2 ; or the 𝔭i are of three different classes.

If all 𝔭i are principal, then each 𝔭i splits completely in H/K as 𝔭i⁢𝒪H=𝔓i,1⁢𝔓i,2⁢𝔓i,3, with f⁢(𝔓i,j∣𝔭i)=1. By multiplicativity f⁢(𝔓i,j∣p)=1. So fH⁢(x) factors with degrees (1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1) modulo p.

If all 𝔭i are non-principal of either class - we can’t distinguish with H(!) - then each 𝔭i does not split completely in H/K. Since H/K is Galois with prime degree, they therefore remain inert. So 𝔭i⁢𝒪H is prime in L with f⁢(𝔭i⁢𝒪H∣𝔭i)=3. By multiplicativity f⁢(𝔭i⁢𝒪H∣p)=3. So fH⁢(x) factors with degrees (3,3,3) modulo p.

If the 𝔭i are of three different classes, then say 𝔭1 is principal, 𝔭2 is non-principal of class 1 , and 𝔭3 is non-principal of class 2. From the above discussion we know 𝔭1 splits complete as 𝔭1⁢𝒪H=𝔓1⁢𝔓2⁢𝔓3 with f⁢(𝔓i∣p)=1. But both 𝔭2 and 𝔭3 are inert in H, so 𝔭2⁢𝒪H and 𝔭3⁢𝒪H are prime with f⁢(𝔭2⁢𝒪H∣p)=3 and f⁢(𝔭3⁢𝒪H∣p)=3. Therefore fH⁢(x) factors with degrees (1,1,1,3,3) modulo p.

This discussion can be summarised by the following table

In K	Subcases	fK degrees	fH degrees
p⁢𝒪K prime	p⁢𝒪K principal	(3)	(3,3,3)
p⁢𝒪K=𝔭1⁢𝔮1	𝔭1,𝔮1 principal	(1,2)	(1,1,1,2,2,2)
	𝔭1,𝔮1 non-principal	(1,2)	(3,6)
p⁢𝒪K=𝔭1⁢𝔭2⁢𝔭3	𝔭i all principal	(1,1,1)	(1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1)
	𝔭i all non-principal	(1,1,1)	(3,3,3)
	𝔭i all different classes	(1,1,1)	(1,1,1,3,3)

The upshot of this is that non-homogeneous splitting is detected uniquely by factorisation of fH⁢(x) modulo p having degrees (1,1,1,3,3). If this occurs, when we have non-homogeneous splitting, and if it does not occur then we have homogeneous splitting.

The goal of the remaining sections will be to prove the following theorem

Theorem 3.1. Let K be a cubic number field with hK=3, and let H/K its Hilbert class field. Let S be the splitting field of H/ℚ, with d=[S:H]. Then K has homogeneous splitting if and only if d≤2.

5 4. [S:H]≤2 IMPLIES HOMOGENEOUS SPLITTING

Suppose that [S:H]≤2, and suppose some prime p splits in a non-homogeneous way in K. So p⁢𝒪K=𝔭1⁢𝔭2⁢𝔭3 with 𝔭1 principal, and 𝔭2,𝔭3 non-principal, say. Then let 𝔓1 be a prime in H above the principal prime 𝔭1. From the discussion previously, we know f⁢(𝔓1∣p)=1. The prime in H above 𝔭2 is 𝔭⁢𝒪H, since 𝔭2 is inert, and f⁢(𝔭2⁢𝒪H∣p)=3. Let ℜ1 be a prime above 𝔓1 in S. It is not clear how 𝔓1 behaves in S/H, but regardless we have f(ℜ1∣𝔓1)≤[S:K]≤2. Let ℜ2 be a prime above 𝔭2⁢𝒪H in S. Again it is not clear how 𝔭⁢𝒪H behaves in S/H, but we do have f⁢(ℜ2∣𝔭2⁢𝒪H)≥1.

This information fits into the following field diagram.

By multiplicativity we have f⁢(ℜ1∣p)≤1×2=2, and f⁢(ℜ2∣p)≥3×1=3. But this is not possible in the Galois extension S/ℚ, every prime above p must have the same inertial degree. This proves that the splitting of p in K must be homogeneous.

6 5. [S:H]>2 IMPLIES NON-HOMOGENEOUS SPlitTing

This direction is a little more delicate, at the moment. It relies on the classification of transitive groups of degree 9, and the Chevotarev density theorem. With more work in Proposition 2.1. one could presumably even determine the exact structure of the Galois group in the case where [S:K]=1,2, or 6 . But again this is more effort than I want to expend.

Recall the Chebotarev density theorem, phrased in terms of the splitting of a polynomial modulo p goes as follows.

Theorem 5.1 (Chebotarev density theorem). Let f⁢(x)∈ℤ⁢[x] be a monic irreducible polynomial with deg⁡(f)=n. Let E=ℚ⁢(α) where α is a root of f⁢(x), and let F be the normal closure of E. Let P=(n1,…,nr) be a partition of n. Let 𝒮 be the set of unramified primes, and 𝒮P be the set of unramified primes p for which f⁢(x) factors modulo p into irreducibles of degree (n1,…,nr). Let G=Gal⁡(F/ℚ) be the Galois group of E, viewed as a subgroup of the symmetric group Σn. And let GP be the set of elements of G with cycle type (n1,…,nr). Then the density δ⁢(𝒮P) of 𝒮P satisfies

	
limN→∞#⁢{p∈𝒮p∣p≤N}#⁢{p∈𝒮∣p≤N}=:δ(𝒮p)=#⁢GP#⁢G.
	

In particular, if #⁢GP>0, then 𝒮P≠∅, and there exists some prime p for which f⁢(x) factors modulo p with degrees P=(n1,…,nr), and in fact infinitely many.

Recall from Proposition 2.1, if [S:H]>2, then [S:H]=6 or 18 . Which then corresponds to [S:ℚ]=54 or 162 . The Galois group of H/ℚ then corresponds to a transitive group of degree 9 of order 54 or 162 . (Here 9 corresponds to the degree of H/ℚ, and of the polynomial fH⁢(x). The order 54 or 162 is the degree of the splitting field S/ℚ.) When [S:H]≤2, we get [S:ℚ]=9 or 18 giving transitive groups groups of degree 9 and order 9 or 18 .

Butler and McKay BM83 classify the transitive groups of degree up to 11 (and in particular degree 9). Those groups relevant to us are summarised in the following table by limiting the groups to those of degree 9 and order 54 or 162 . Those of order 9 and 18 are also included for completeness to illustrate how homogeneous splitting in the previous section also follows from Chebotarev (at least for all but finitely many primes).

Group G	Name	Order #⁢G	#⁢G(1,1,1,3,3)
9T1	C⁢(9)=9	9	0
9T2	E⁢(9)=3⊗3	9	0
9⁢T3	D⁢(9)=9:2	18	0
9⁢T4	S⁢(3)⊗3	18	0
9⁢T5	S⁢(3)⁢[12]⁢S⁢(3)=32:2	18	0
9T10	[32]⁢S⁢(3)6	54	6
9⁢T11	E(9):6=12[32:2]S(3)	54	6
9⁢T12	[32]⁢S⁢(3)	54	6
9⁢T13	E(9):D6=[32:2]3=[12S(3)2]3	54	6
9⁢T20	[33]S(3)=3[S(3)	162	12
9⁢T21	12[33:2]S(3)	162	12
9⁢T22	[33:2]3	162	12

From this table we can see that groups of order 54 or 162 always have #⁢G(1,1,1,3,3)>0. From Chebotarev, this means that there exist some prime p for which fH⁢(x) factors modulo p into degrees (1,1,1,3,3). By the analysis of the prime decomposition in K, and H from section 3 . this type of splitting occurs only for non-homogeneous splitting of p. Therefore if [S:H]>2, the field K has non-homogeneous splitting.

Remark 5.2. In all the cases I have explicitly calculated so far, the splitting field has degree [S:H]=1,2 or 6 . And the structure of the Galois group depends only on [S:H], as follows.

[S:H]	Gal⁡(H/ℚ)	Name
1	9⁢T2	E⁢(9)=3⊗3
2	9⁢T4	S⁢(3)⊗3
6	9⁢T12	[32]⁢S⁢(3)

With more effort in Proposition 2.1, this could probably be proven explicitly.

Remark 5.3. One question really remains. Given a cubic number field K with hK=3, how can one determine whether [S:H]=2 or 6 from the arithmetic of K itself?","1 Introduction and main results

Let K be a cubic number field, with class number hK=3. Then the class group 𝒞⁢(K) is isomorphic to ℤ3, where 0 corresponds to the principal ideal class, and 1 and 2 correspond to different non-principal ideal classes. Consider how a prime p∈ℤ can split in K. Excluding the finite number of primes which ramify, the following are the only possibilities.

(1) p⁢𝒪k is inert, with f⁢(p⁢𝒪K∣p)=3.

(2) p⁢𝒪K=𝔭1⁢𝔮1 with f⁢(𝔭1∣p)=1 and f⁢(𝔮1∣p)=2.

(3) p⁢𝒪K=𝔭1⁢𝔭2⁢𝔭3 with f⁢(𝔭i∣p)=1, so p⁢𝒪K splits completely.

Definition 1.1 (homogenous splitting). Let K be a cubic number field, with class number hK=3. Let p∈ℤ be a prime which does not ramify in K. We say K has homogeneous splitting if complete splitting p⁢𝒪K= 𝔭1⁢𝔭2⁢𝔭3 implies [𝔭1]=[𝔭2]=[𝔭3] in 𝒞⁢(K). Otherwise, we say that K has nonhomogeneous splitting.

It turns out that this homogeneous splitting has connections with the splitting of the defining polynomial of the Hilbert class field of K. Once the splitting field of the Hilbert class field of K is known, homogeneous splitting can be proven easily. There is a condition on the degree of this splitting field which implies homogeneous splitting, which we study in the present manuscript, and conversely if this condition fails, we show that nonhomogeneous splitting must occur using the Chebotarev density theorem.

The main goal of this manuscript is to prove the following theorem.

Key words and phrases: Chebotarev density theorem, homogenous splitting of primes. Mathematics Subject Classification: primary 11Rxx, secondary 11R45, 11R29, 11R37. THEOREM 1.2. Let K be a cubic number field with class number hK=3, and let H/K be its Hilbert class field. Let S be the splitting field of H/ℚ, with 𝒟=[S:H]. Then K has homogeneous splitting if and only if 𝒟⩽2.

Throughout Section 2 and Section 3 we build the tools required to prove Theorem 1.2, and finally in Section 4, we present a proof.

2 Hilbert class field of K and its splitting field

For a field K as above, consider the Hilbert class field H. We know that hK=3, and Gal⁡(H/K)≅𝒞⁢(K) which means H/K has degree 3 and H/ℚ has degree 9.

If K/ℚ is Galois, then a standard argument shows that H/ℚ is also Galois. H is the maximal unramified Abelian extension of K, and any conjugate of H/ℚ is also an unramified Abelian extension of K. Therefore any conjugate of H/ℚ is contained in H, and for degree reasons is in fact equal to H. This means H/ℚ is equal to all its conjugates, and so is Galois.

If K/ℚ is non-Galois, then H/ℚ cannot be Galois. If H/ℚ were Galois, then G:=Gal⁡(H/ℚ)≅ℤ3×ℤ3 or ≅ℤ9 by the classification of groups of order 9 . So K/ℚ would correspond to a subgroup of G=Gal⁡(H/ℚ) of index 3. Such a subgroup would necessarily be normal, since G is Abelian. But normal subgroups of the Galois group correspond to Galois extensions of the base field, which means K/ℚ would be Galois.

Consider now the splitting field S of the Hilbert class field H/ℚ, which fits into the following field diagram.

Proposition 2.1. The degree of the splitting field S/H is either 1,2,6 or 18. This corresponds to degrees 9,18,54 or 162 as an extension of ℚ.

Proof. The degree of S/H is 1 if and only if H/ℚ is Galois, which is if and only if K/ℚ itself is Galois. We can therefore assume that K/ℚ, and H/ℚ are non-Galois, and show one of the remaining cases holds.

The splitting field of K/ℚ has degree 2 over K and degree 6 over ℚ. This is a standard result, namely let f⁢(x) be the defining polynomial of K, with roots α1,α2,α3. Then K is obtained by attaching α1, but since K is not Galois, α2,α3∉K. Dividing out f⁢(x)/(x-α1) gives an irreducible quadratic polynomial over K which has roots α2,α3. Attaching α2 to K gives K~ a degree 2 extension of K, a degree 6 extension of ℚ. And then already α3∈K~, since α2⁢α3,α2∈K~. So f⁢(x) splits completely in K~, and this is the splitting field of K. Consider the extension H/K, and find some α1∈H\K. Since H/K is Galois, we get conjugates α2:=α1σ,α3:=α1σ2 in H, where Gal⁡(H/K)≅ℤ3 is generated by σ.

Let h⁢(x) be the defining polynomial for H/ℚ, with roots α1,α2,…,α9. Since H/K is Galois, each conjugate H′/K′ will also be Galois, where K′ is one of the conjugates of K/ℚ. This means there are 3 conjugates H, H′,H′′, over K,K′,K′′ respectively, and we can therefore group the roots such that α1,2,3∈H,α4,5,6∈H′ and α7,8,9∈H′′. Consider the polynomial g⁢(x)=(x-α1)⁢(x-α2)⁢(x-α3). Since the α1,2,3 are conjugates over K, this polynomial is in K⁢[x], and is irreducible here since α1∉K. Therefore, we deduce that g⁢(x) is the minimal polynomial for α1 over K.

Since h⁢(x) is a polynomial over K (in fact ℚ ) with root α1, and g⁢(x) is the minimal polynomial for α1 over K, the standard argument using the division algorithm shows g∣h in K⁢[x]. If g′⁢(x) is the minimal polynomial for α4 over K′, and g′′⁢(x) for α7 over K′′, we have g′∣h in K′⁢[x] and g′′∣h in K′′⁢[x] by exactly the same argument.

Consider now the splitting field K~ of K. The splitting field of H/ℚ, whatever it is, must contain K~, so we start here. Furthermore, K~ contains K,K′,K′′. So in K~⁢[x] the polynomial h⁢(x) of H/ℚ splits into three cubic factors as h⁢(x)=g⁢(x)⁢g′⁢(x)⁢g′′⁢(x).

We obtain the splitting field of H/ℚ by making the factors g⁢(x),g′⁢(x) and g′′⁢(x) split completely. And since H/K,H′/K′,H′′/K′′ are Galois, attaching one root of g,g′,g′′ makes that factor split completely. We must attach first the root α1 of g⁢(x) to K~ get a field F1:=K~⁢(α1) containing H, wherein g⁢(x) has split completely. Then F1/ℚ has degree 6×3=18. If this is not the splitting field, one of g′,g′′ has no split. Say, by reordering the roots, it is g′. Attach α4 to F1 to get F2:=K~⁢(α1,α4). Then F2/ℚ has degree 18×3=54. If this is still not the splitting field g′′ has not split, so attach α7 to F2 to get F3:=K~⁢(α1,α4,α7). Then F3/ℚ has degree 54×3= 162. At this point the polynomial f⁢(x) definitely has split completely, so we have found the splitting field.

If S is the splitting field of H/ℚ, then by the tower law [S:H][H:ℚ]= [S:ℚ], so that [S:H]=[S:ℚ]/9. If S=F1, then [S:H]=18/9=2. If S=F2, then [S:H]=54/9=6. Finally if S=F3, then [S:H]= 162/9=18. This completes the proof.

3 Splitting of primes in the Hilbert class field H of K

Now we look at how the prime p can split in K, and what impact this has on the splitting on the Hilbert class field H. We shall analyse what happens with the factorisation in cases (1) to (3), and the subcases of these where the ideals in the factorisation fall into the various different ideal classes in 𝒞⁢(K). Using Dedekind’s theorem, we will relate these to the factorisation modulo p of the polynomials fK⁢(x) defining K/ℚ, and fH⁢(x) defining the Hilbert class field H/ℚ. Recall that the degrees of the irreducible factors of fK⁢(x) modulo p are the inertial degrees of the prime ideals above p in K.

p is inert in K : So p⁢𝒪K is prime, with f⁢(p⁢𝒪K∣p)=3. Therefore fK⁢(x) is irreducible modulo p. The ideal p⁢𝒪K is principal, so splits completely in the Hilbert class field as p⁢𝒪H=𝔅1⁢𝔅2⁢𝔅3, with f⁢(𝔅i∣p⁢𝒪H)=1. Multiplicativity of f means f⁢(𝔅i∣p)=3, so fH⁢(x) factors with degrees (3,3,3) modulo p.

p⁢𝒪K=𝔭1⁢𝔮1 in K: We have f⁢(𝔭1∣p)=1 and f⁢(𝔮1∣p)=2, so fK⁢(x) factors with degrees (1,2) modulo p. Since [𝔮1]=[𝔭1]-1, either both ideals are principal, or both ideals are non-principal. If 𝔭1 is principal, then it splits completely in H/K as 𝔭1⁢𝒪H=𝔅1⁢𝔅2⁢𝔅3 with f⁢(𝔅i∣𝔭1)=1. Since 𝔮1 is also principal, we get complete splitting in H/K as 𝔮1=𝔔1⁢𝔔2⁢𝔔3 with f⁢(𝔔i∣𝔮1)=1. Multiplicativity means f⁢(𝔔i∣p)=2 and f⁢(𝔅i∣p)=1. Therefore fH⁢(x) factors with degrees (1,1,1,2,2,2) modulo p.

If 𝔭1 is non-principal, it does not split completely in H/K. But since H/K is Galois with prime degree, the only other possibility is that 𝔭1 is inert. Therefore 𝔭1⁢𝒪H is prime in L, with f⁢(𝔭1⁢𝒪H∣𝔭1)=3. And 𝔮1⁢𝒪H, similarly, is prime in L with f⁢(𝔮1⁢𝒪H∣𝔮1)=3. Multiplicativity means f⁢(𝔭1⁢𝒪H∣p)=3 and f⁢(𝔮1⁢𝒪H∣p)=6. Therefore fH⁢(x) factors with degrees (3,6) modulo p.

p⁢𝒪K=𝔭1⁢𝔭2⁢𝔭2 in K : So p splits completely in K. We have f⁢(𝔭i∣p)=1, so fK⁢(x) factors with degrees (1,1,1) modulo p. From the previous discussion there are four cases to consider, where all 𝔭i are principal; all 𝔭i are non-principal of class 1 ; all 𝔭i are non-principal of class 2 ; or the 𝔭i are of three different classes. If all 𝔭i are principal, then each 𝔭i splits completely in H/K as 𝔭i⁢𝒪H=𝔅i,1⁢𝔅i,2⁢𝔅i,3, with f⁢(𝔅i,j∣𝔭i)=1. By multiplicativity f⁢(𝔅i,j∣p)=1. So fH⁢(x) factors with degrees (1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1) modulo p.

If all 𝔭i are non-principal of either class - we cannot distinguish with H - then each 𝔭i does not split completely in H/K. Since H/K is Galois with prime degree, they therefore remain inert. So 𝔭i⁢𝒪H is prime in H with f⁢(𝔭i⁢𝒪H∣𝔭i)=3. By multiplicativity f⁢(𝔭i⁢𝒪H∣p)=3. Therefore, fH⁢(x) factors with degrees (3,3,3) modulo p.

If the 𝔭i are of three different classes, then say 𝔭1 is principal, 𝔭2 is nonprincipal of class 1 , and 𝔭3 is non-principal of class 2 . From the above discussion we know 𝔭1 splits completely as 𝔭1⁢𝒪H=𝔅1⁢𝔅2⁢𝔅3 with f⁢(𝔅i∣p)=1. But both 𝔭2 and 𝔭3 are inert in H, so 𝔭2⁢𝒪H and 𝔭3⁢𝒪H are prime with f⁢(𝔭2⁢𝒪H∣p)=3 and f⁢(𝔭3⁢𝒪H∣p)=3. Therefore fH⁢(x) factors with degrees (1,1,1,3,3) modulo p.

The upshot of this is that non-homogeneous splitting is detected uniquely by factorisation of fH⁢(x) modulo p having degrees (1,1,1,3,3). If this occurs, then we have non-homogeneous splitting, and if it does not occur then we have homogeneous splitting.

4 Proof of Theorem 1.2

4.1. 𝒟⩽2 implies homogenous splitting. Suppose that 𝒟=[S:H]⩽2, and suppose some prime p splits in a non-homogeneous way in K. So p⁢𝒪K= 𝔭1⁢𝔭2⁢𝔭3 with 𝔭1 principal, and 𝔭2,𝔭3 non-principal, say. Then let 𝔅1 be a prime in H above the principal prime 𝔭1. From the discussion previously, we know f⁢(𝔅1∣p)=1. The prime in H above 𝔭2 is 𝔭2⁢𝒪H, since 𝔭2 is inert, and f⁢(𝔭2⁢𝒪H∣p)=3. Now let ℜ1 be a prime above 𝔅1 in S. It is not clear how 𝔅1 behaves in S/H, but regardless we have f(ℜ1∣𝔅1)⩽[S:K]⩽2. Let ℜ2 be a prime above 𝔭2⁢𝒪H in S. Again it is not clear how 𝔭2⁢𝒪H behaves in S/H, but we do have f⁢(ℜ2∣𝔭2⁢𝒪H)⩾1.

This information fits into the following field diagram.

By multiplicativity we have f⁢(ℜ1∣p)⩽1×2=2, and f⁢(ℜ2∣p)⩾ 3×1=3. But this is not possible in the Galois extension S/ℚ, every prime above p must have the same inertial degree. This proves that the splitting of p in K must be homogeneous if 𝒟⩽2.

4.2. 𝒟>2 implies non-homogenous splitting. This direction is a little more delicate. It relies on the classification of transitive groups of degree 9, and the Chebotarev density theorem. With more work in Proposition 2.1, one could presumably even determine the exact structure of the Galois group in the case where [S:H]=1,2, or 6 .

Recall the Chebotarev density theorem, phrased in terms of the splitting of a polynomial modulo p :

Group G	Name	Order #⁢G	#⁢G(1,1,1,3,3)

Table 1

Theorem 4.1 (Chebotarev density theorem). Let f⁢(x)∈ℤ⁢[x] be a monic irreducible polynomial with deg⁡(f)=n. Let E=ℚ⁢(α) where α is a root of f⁢(x), and let F be the normal closure of E. Let P=(n1,…,nr) be a partition of n. Let 𝒮 be the set of unramified primes, and 𝒮P be the set of unramified primes p for which f⁢(x) factors modulo p into irreducibles of degree (n1,…,nr). Let G=Gal⁡(F/ℚ) be the Galois group of F, viewed as a subgroup of the symmetric group ∑n, and let GP be the set of elements of G with cycle type (n1,…,nr). Then the density δ⁢(𝒮P) of 𝒮P satisfies

	
limN→∞⁡#⁢{p∈𝒮P∣p⩽N}#⁢{p∈𝒮∣p⩽N}:=δ⁢(𝒮P)=#⁢GP#⁢G.
	

In particular, if #⁢GP>0, then 𝒮P≠∅, and there exists some prime p for which f⁢(x) factors modulo p with degrees P=(n1,…,nr), and in fact infinitely many.

Recall from Proposition 2.1, if [S:H]>2, then [S:H]=6 or 18, which then corresponds to [S:ℚ]=54 or 162 . The Galois group of H/ℚ then corresponds to a transitive group of degree 9 of order 54 or 162 . (Here 9 corresponds to the degree of H/ℚ, and of the polynomial fH⁢(x). The order 54 or 162 is the degree of the splitting field S/ℚ.) When [S:H]⩽2, we get [S:ℚ]=9 or 18 giving transitive groups of degree 9 and order 9 or 18 .

Butler and McKay [1] classify the transitive groups of degree up to 11 (and in particular degree 9). Those groups relevant to us are summarised in Table 1 by limiting the groups to those of degree 9 and order 54 or 162 . Those of order 9 and 18 are also included for completeness to illustrate how homogeneous splitting in the previous section also follows from Chebotarev density theorem (at least for all but finitely many primes).

From Table 1 we see that groups of order 54 or 162 always have

	
#⁢G⁢(1,1,1,3,3)>0.
	

From Chebotarev, this means that there exist some prime p for which fH⁢(x) factors modulo p into degrees (1,1,1,3,3). By the analysis of the prime decomposition in K, and H from Section 3, this type of splitting occurs only for non-homogeneous splitting of p.

"TheOrem 4.1. The group G=A¯+B, where A and B are copies of the standard basic subgroup, has a cobounded subgroup H with the following properties. (1) H is not pure-complete. (2) H is not semi-complete. (3) H is not a direct sum of closed groups. Proof. Define H={p⁢G,a1,an+1+bn}n<ω. Let S=A¯⁢[p], and observe that S⊆H. We show that S does not support a pure subgroup of H. Assume that S does support a pure subgroup K of H. Since each element of S has the same height in H as in G, it follows that K is pure in G. Since K⁢[p]=A¯⁢[p],K is a closed group ; hence K is a direct summand of G. In fact, we have the decompositions G= K+B and H=K+(H∩B). It is easily verified that H∩B=p⁢B,

262 PAUL HILL so we have the equation H=K+p⁢B. The defining equation for H and the above decompositions imply that {p⁢K+p⁢B,a1,an+1+bn}n<ω= K+p⁢B. Thus, for each positive integer n,

	
pn⁢(an+2+bn+1)=pn⁢k(n)+pn+1⁢b(n)
	

where k(n)∈K and b(n)∈B. Define s⁢(1)=1 and suppose that a positive integer s⁢(i) has been chosen for i≦n such that s⁢(1)<s⁢(2)<⋯<s⁢(n). Choose s⁢(n+1)>s⁢(n) such that b⁢(n)∈∑i<s⁢(n+1){bi}. Since p2⁢(pn⁢k(n))=0 for each n and since K is closed, ∑ps⁢(n)⁢k(s⁢(n)) must converge in K. Since

	
pn⁢k(n)=pn⁢an+2+(pn⁢bn+1-pn+1⁢b(x))
	

and since G=A¯+B, it follows that ∑(ps⁢(n)⁢bs⁢(n)+1-ps⁢(n)+1⁢b(s(n)) must converge in B. However, this is impossible since, for each positive integer n, the projection of the limit onto {bs⁢(n)+1} is ps⁢(n)⁢bs⁢(n)+1≠0. Thus S does not support a pure subgroup of H, and we have verified (1).

Assume that H is a direct sum of closed groups. Then H is a direct sum of a countable number of closed groups since G, and therefore H by Theorem 2.1, has a countable basic subgroup. It follows from Theorem 5.6 in [7] that a direct sum of a countable number of closed groups is pure-complete. Since we have already verified (1), we conclude that H is not a direct sum of closed groups. Furthermore, every semi-complete group [10] is a direct sum of closed groups, so the theorem is proved.

Coroluary 4.2. The property of being pure-complete is not a quasi-isomorphic invariant.

Corollary 4.3. The property of being semi-complete is not a quasi-isomorphic invariant.

Corollary 4.4. The property of being a direct sum of closed groups is not a quasi-isomorphic invariant.","Theorem 3.4. Let M be a Q⁢T⁢A⁢G-m⁢o⁢d⁢u⁢l⁢e such that M=B¯+B′ where B,B′ are basic submodules of M, and B¯ the closed module defined by B. Then M has a cobounded submodule N such that: (i) N is not h-pure complete; (ii) N is not semiclosed, and N is not a direct sum of closed modules. Proof. Let B=⨁Bi and B′=⨁Bi′ where each Bi and Bi′ is a direct sum of uniserial modules of length i. We define N=B1+∑n<ω(Bn+1+Bn′)+H1⁢(M). Let S be the socle of B¯, then S⊆N. Suppose on contrary that S supports a h-pure submodule K of N. Now Soc⁡(K)=Soc⁡(B¯), the h-purity of K implies that K is a closed module. Therefore, it is a summand of M, we may write M=K+B′ and N= K+(N∩B′). By the defining relation N∩B′=H1⁢(B′), we have N=K+H1⁢(B′). These decompositions and the definition of N imply that

	
H1⁢(K)+H1⁢(B′)+B1+∑n<ω(Bn+1+Bn′)=K+H1⁢(B′)
	

For each integer n and the uniform element x∈Bn+2+Bn+1′,∃ an element y such that d⁢(x⁢Ry⁢R)=n, and y∈K+H1⁢(B′) such that d⁢(2⁢Ry⁢R)=n, where z=un+vn, un∈K,vn∈H1⁢(B′). Now we define s⁢(1)=1 and positive integers s⁢(i) for i≤n such that s⁢(1)<s⁢(2)<⋯<s⁢(n). We may choose s⁢(n+1)>s⁢(n) such that vn∈ ∑i<s⁢(n+1)Bi. Now e⁢(un)≤n+2 for each n and K is closed. The Cauchy sequence {us⁢(n)′} must converge in K. Here d⁢(us⁢(n)⁢R⁢Rus⁢(n)⁢R)=s⁢(n).

Since M=B¯+B′, the sequence ∑{cs⁢(n)+1-ds⁢(n)} must converge in B′. Here d⁢(us⁢(n)+1⁢Rcs⁢(n)+1⁢R)=s(n) and d⁢(us⁢(n)⁢Rds⁢(n)R)=s⁢(n)+1. But for each integer n, the projection of the limit onto {us⁢(n)′} is cs⁢(n)+1 which is not zero. This contradiction implies that S does not support a h-pure submodule, Therefore, N is not h-pure complete.

758 MEHDI ET AL. For (ii) assume that N is a direct sum of a countable number of closed modules. Therefore, by Theorem 2.4, N has a countably generated basic submodule. Since a direct sum of countably generated closed modules is h-pure complete by the above discussion N is not a direct sum of closed modules. Since every semiclosed module is a direct sum of closed modules and uniserial modules, the result follows. The properties of being h-pure complete, semiclosed, and a direct sum of closed modules are not quasi-isomorphic invariants.",0168.27303.tex,1188.16002.tex,Variation of subject; Paraphrase; Deletions
"Corollary 2.2. The critical number of a primary group is a quasi-isomorphic invariant. Theorem 2.1 also yields a refinement of Theorem 5.1 in [3]. Corollary 2.3. If H is a cobounded subgroup of the primary group G and N is high in G, then M=H∩N is high in H.

ON QUASI-ISOMORPHIC INVARIANTS OF PRIMARY GROUPS 259 Proof. Since N is high in G, we have the relation G⁢[p]= N⁢[p]+G1⁢[p] where G1=⋂n<ωpn⁢G. Thus H⁢[p]=M⁢[p]+H1⁢[p] since H1=G1. Now the purity of M in H implies that M is a high subgroup of H.

The question now arises as to whether for each pure and dense subgroup B of a cobounded subgroup H of the primary group G there exists a pure and dense subgroup A of G such that B=A∩H.

Theorem 2.4. If H is a cobounded subgroup of the primary group G and if B is pure and dense in H, then there exists a pure and dense subgroup A of G such that B=A∩H.

Proof. Choose A maximal in G with respect to A∩H=B. Then A is neat in G. We show that the socle of A is dense in G⁢[p]. Let x∈G⁢[p]. There is an element a∈A such that x=a+h where h∈H. Since p⁢h∈A∩H=B and since B is pure, there exists b∈B such that p⁢h=p⁢b. Thus

	
x=(a+b)+(h-b)∈{A⁢[p],H⁢[p]}≦{A⁢[p],B⁢⌊p⌋¯}≦A⁢⌊p⌋¯.
	

By Theorem 1 in [6], A is pure and dense in G. Observe that B=A∩H is cobounded in A since H is cobounded in G. It follows that B is a direct sum of cyclic groups if and only if A is a direct sum of cyclic groups. Hence we have the following corollary. Corollary 2.5. Let H be a cobounded subgroup of the primary group G. The correspondence B→B∩H is a function from the basic subgroups of G onto the basic subgroups of H.","Corollary 2.6. For a cobounded submodule N of a Q⁢T⁢A⁢G-module M and a high submodule K⊂M,N∩K is high in N.

Proof. Since K is high in M, Soc⁡(M)=Soc⁡(K)⊕Soc⁡(M1), where M1= ⋂k∈ωHk⁢(M) and Soc⁡(N)=Soc⁡(N∩K)+Soc⁡(N1) as N1=M1. Again N∩K is pure in N; therefore, N∩K is high in N.

To investigate h-pure and dense submodules of cobounded submodules of a Q⁢T⁢A⁢G-module, we proceed as follows.

Theorem 2.7. If N is a cobounded submodule of the Q⁢T⁢A⁢G-module M and if B is h-pure and dense in N, then there exists a h-pure and dense submodule K of M which is maximal such that B=K∩N.

Proof. Let K be the maximal submodule of M such that K∩N=B. Now K is h-neat in M. For x∈Soc⁡(M) there exists an element y∈K such that x⁢R=y⁢R+z⁢R with z∈N. Now there exists z′∈K∩N=B such that d⁢(z′⁢Rz⁢R)=1 and the h-purity of B ensures the existence of x′∈B such that d⁢(x′⁢Rz⁢R)=1 and x′⁢R=z′⁢R. This implies that

	
x=y+x′+(z-x′)∈Soc⁡(K)+Soc⁡(N)⊆Soc⁡(K)+Soc⁡(B¯)⊆Soc⁡(K)¯.
	

Therefore, K is h-pure and dense in M. Now B=K∩N is cobounded in K because N is cobounded in M. This implies that B is a direct sum of uniserial modules if and only if K is a direct sum of uniserial modules.

Remark 2.8. For a cobounded submodule N of a Q⁢T⁢A⁢G-module M, there is a function which maps the basic submodules B of M onto the basic submodules B∩N of N.",0168.27303.tex,1188.16002.tex,Variation of subject; Paraphrase; Formula Manipulation
"THEOREM 2.1. Suppose that H is a cobounded subgroup of the primary group G. If B is pure and dense in G, relative to the p adic topology, then B∩H is pure and dense in H.

Proof. There is, of course, no proper cobounded subgroup of a divisible group. Thus {B,H}/B=G/B and {B,H}=G, so H/B∩H≅ {B,H}/B=G/B and B∩H is dense in H. Since H is cobounded and since B⁢[p] is dense in G⁢[p], it is immediate that (B∩H)⁢[p] is dense in H⁢[p]. In order to prove that B∩H is pure in H, it suffices, according to [6], to prove that B∩H is a neat subgroup of H. Suppose that p⁢h=b where h∈H and b∈B∩H. Since B is pure, there is an element b′∈B such that p⁢b′=b=p⁢h. Now (h-b′)-b′′∈H for some b′′∈B⁢[p] since B⁢[p] is dense in G⁢[p] and since H is cobounded. Observe that b′+b′′∈B∩H and that p⁢(b′+b′′)=b. This completes the proof of the theorem.","Theorem 2.4. Let N be a cobounded submodule of a QTAG-module M. If the submodule B is h-pure and dense in M relative to h-topology, then B∩N is h-pure and dense in N.

Proof. A divisble Q⁢T⁢A⁢G-module M has no proper cobounded submodule. Therefore, (B+N)/B=M/B as B+N=M and

	
N/(B∩N)≅(B+N)/B=M/B
	

This implies that B∩N is dense in N. Now N is bounded and Soc⁡(B) is dense in Soc⁡(M), implying that Soc⁡(B∩N) is dense in Soc⁡(N). Now it is sufficient to prove that B∩N is h-neat in N. This would imply that B∩N is h-pure in N.

Let x∈(B∩N)∩H1⁢(N) such that there exists y∈N and d⁢(y⁢Rx⁢R)=1. As B is h-pure in M, there exists z∈B such that d⁢(z⁢Rx⁢R)=1. Since Soc⁡(B) is dense in Soc⁡(M) and N is cobounded y-z∈B+N and y-z-u∈N for some u∈Soc⁡(B). Now z+u∈B∩N and d⁢((z+u)⁢R/x⁢R)=1, i.e., B∩N is h-neat in N.",0168.27303.tex,1188.16002.tex,Variation of subject; Paraphrase; Different Presentation
"Two primary groups G and H are quasi-isomorphic if there exist subgroups G* and H* of G and H such that G* and H* are isomorphic and such that G/G* and H/H* are bounded. The paper is concerned with properties, of primary groups, that are invariant under the relation of quasi-isomorphism. In the final section, a condition is given which is necessary and sufficient in order that the primary groups G and H be quasi-isomorphic in case G and H are both direct sums of closed groups.","Two QTAG-modules are quasi-isomorphic when they contain cobounded submodules. Here we prove that cobounded submodules inherit basic submodules. Then we impose some restrictions on quasi-isomorphism and find that quasi-isomorphic modules with these restrictions are very different. We also study the quasi-isomorphism of direct sum of uniserial modules and some quasi-isomorphic variants. It is natural to ask if for two quasi-isomorphic Q⁢T⁢A⁢G-modules M,M′ if M is a direct sum of countably generated uniserial modules, then M′ is also the direct sum of countably generated uniserial modules or not. In the last section we obtain the condition under which this is possible.",0168.27303.tex,1188.16002.tex,Variation of subject; Paraphrase; Insertions
