Definition:Altitude of Triangle/Foot,Foot,"Let ABC be a triangle.

Let h_a be the altitude of A:

:


The point at which h_a meets BC (or its production) is the foot of the altitude h_a.

Definition:Right Angle/Perpendicular/Foot,Foot,":


The foot of a perpendicular is the point where it intersects the line to which it is at right angles.

In the above diagram, the point C is the foot of the perpendicular CD."
Definition:Residue (Complex Analysis),Residue,"Let f: ℂ→ℂ be a complex function.

Let z_0 ∈ U ⊂ℂ such that f is analytic in U ∖{ z_0 }.


Then by Existence of Laurent Series, there is a Laurent series:
:∑_j  = -∞^∞ a_j ( z - z_0 )^j
such that the sum converges to f in U - { z_0 }.  


The residue at a point z = z_0 of f is defined as a_-1 in that Laurent series.

It is denoted Res( f,   )z_0 or just Res(   )z_0 when f is understood."
Definition:Residue (Number Theory),Residue,"Let m, n ∈ℕ be natural numbers.

Let a ∈ℤ be an integer such that a is not divisible by m.

Then a is a residue of m of order n  if and only if :
:∃ x ∈ℤ: x^n ≡ a  m
where ≡ denotes modulo congruence.


=== Nonresidue ===
Let m, n ∈ℕ be natural numbers.

Let a ∈ℤ be an integer such that a is not divisible by m.


a is a nonresidue of m of order n  if and only if  there does not exist x ∈ℤ such that:
:x^n ≡ a  m

where ≡ denotes modulo congruence."
