Definition:Tableau Proof (Formal Systems),Tableau Proof,"A tableau proof for a proof system is a technique for presenting a logical argument in the form of a formal proof in a straightforward, standard form.

On  , the proof system is usually natural deduction.


A tableau proof is a sequence of lines specifying the order of premises, assumptions, inferences and conclusion in support of an argument.


Each line of a tableau proof has a particular format. It consists of the following parts:

* Line: The line number of the proof. This is a simple numbering from 1 upwards.
* Pool: The list of all the lines containing the pool of assumptions for the formula introduced on this line.
* Formula: The propositional formula introduced on this line.
* Rule: The justification for introducing this line. This should be the rule of inference being used to derive this line.
* Depends on: The lines (if any) upon which this line directly depends. For premises and assumptions, this field will be empty.


Optionally, a comment may be added to explicitly point out possible intricacies.

If any assumptions are discharged on a certain line, for the sake of clarity it is preferred that such be mentioned explicitly in a comment.


At the end of a tableau proof, the only lines upon which the proof depends may be those which contain the premises.


=== Length ===
The length of a tableau proof is the number of lines it has.

Definition:Set Intersection,Intersection,"Let S and T be sets.


The (set) intersection of S and T is written S ∩ T.

It means the set which consists of all the elements which are contained in both of S and T:

:x ∈ S ∩ T  x ∈ S  x ∈ T

or, more formally:

:A = S ∩ T ∀ z: ( z ∈ A  z ∈ S  z ∈ T )


We can write:

:S ∩ T := { x: x ∈ S  x ∈ T }

and can voice it S intersect T.


It can be seen that, in this form, ∩ is a binary operation which acts on sets.


One often says that two sets intersect  if and only if  they have non-empty intersection.


=== Set of Sets ===
Let S be a set of sets.

The intersection of S is:
:⋂ S := { x: ∀ S ∈ S: x ∈ S }
That is, the set of all objects that are elements of all the elements of S.


Thus:
:⋂{ S, T } := S ∩ T

=== Family of Sets ===
Let I be an indexing set.

Let ⟨ S_i ⟩_i ∈ I be a family of sets indexed by I.


Then the intersection of ⟨ S_i ⟩ is defined as:

:⋂_i ∈ I S_i := { x: ∀ i ∈ I: x ∈ S_i }


=== In the context of the Universal Set ===

In treatments of set theory in which the concept of the universal set is recognised, this can be expressed as follows.

Let 𝕌 be a universal set.

Let I be an indexing set.

Let ⟨ S_i ⟩_i ∈ I be an indexed family of subsets of 𝕌.


Then the intersection of ⟨ S_i ⟩ is defined and denoted as:

:⋂_i ∈ I S_i := { x ∈𝕌: ∀ i ∈ I: x ∈ S_i }

=== Subsets of General Set ===
This definition is the same when the universal set 𝕌 is replaced by any set X, which may or may not be a universal set:

Let I be an indexing set.

Let ⟨ S_i ⟩_i ∈ I be an indexed family of subsets of a set X.


Then the intersection of ⟨ S_i ⟩ is defined as:

:⋂_i ∈ I S_i := { x ∈ X: ∃ i ∈ I: x ∈ S_i }
where i is a bound variable.

=== Countable Intersection ===
Let 𝕊 be a set of sets.

Let ⟨ S_n ⟩_n ∈ℕ be a sequence in 𝕊.

Let S be the intersection of ⟨ S_n ⟩_n ∈ℕ:
:S = ⋂_n ∈ℕ S_n


Then S is a countable intersection of sets in 𝕊.

=== Finite Intersection ===
Let S = S_1 ∩ S_2 ∩…∩ S_n.

Then:
:S = ⋂_i ∈ℕ^*_n S_i := { x: ∀ i ∈ℕ^*_n: x ∈ S_i }
where ℕ^*_n = { 1, 2, 3, …, n }.


If it is clear from the context that i ∈ℕ^*_n, we can also write ⋂_ℕ^*_n S_i."
Definition:Intersection (Geometry),Intersection,"The intersection of two lines AB and CD is denoted by AB ∩ CD.

b ( f_n - 1 - ⌊ f_n - 1⌋)     : n > 1

:going vertically ""down"" the page or screen from the origin, the numbers on the y-axis are negative.

Let the x-axis, y-axis and z-axis be defined.


Let a point P be identified on the x-axis, different from O, with the coordinate pair ( 1, 0 ) in the x-y plane.

Let the point P' be identified on the y-axis such that OP' = OP.

It remains to identify the point P' ' on the z-axis such that OP' ' = OP.

The orientation of the z-axis is determined by the position of P' ' relative to O.


The Cartesian 3-Space is defined as left-handed when P' ' is located as follows.

Let the coordinate axes be oriented as follows:

Imagine being positioned, standing on the x-y plane at O, and facing along the x-axis towards P, with P' on the left. 

P' ' is then one unit below the x-y plane.


Hence, let the coordinate axes be oriented as follows:

:Let the x-axis increase from West to East.
:Let the y-axis increase from South to North.

Then the z-axis increases from above to below.


Simiarly, let the x-y plane be identified with the plane of the page or screen such aligned perpendicular to the line of sight such that:

:the x-axis increases from left to right.
:the y-axis increases from bottom to top.

Then the z-axis increases from in front to behind (that is, from closer in to further away).

Let ϕ: S → T be a bijection such that:

Alternatively, we can define S to be a ring extension of R if R is a subring of S (provided we insist that a subring inherits the multiplicative identity from its parent ring).


These definitions are equivalent up to isomorphism, for if R ⊆ S is a subring, then the identity id : R → S is a monomorphism.

Conversely if ϕ : R → S is a monomorphism, then imϕ⊆ S is a subring of S.

:m is such that b^m ≤ n < b^m + 1
:all the r_j are such that 0 ≤ r_j < b.

  
 

The number b is known as the number base to which n is represented.

n is thus described as being (written) in base b.

=== Partial Embedding ===

A common method of constructing isomorphisms and elementary embeddings in proofs is to recursively define them a finite number of elements at a time.  For this  purpose, it is useful to have a definition of embeddings using functions which are only defined on a subset of M:

:∑_0 ≤ i ≤ n( ∑_0 ≤ j ≤ i a_i j) = ∑_0 ≤ j ≤ i ≤ n a_i j

=== Definition by Propositional Function ===
Let ( S, + ) be an algebraic structure where the operation + is an operation derived from, or arising from, the addition operation on the natural numbers.

Let ( a_1, a_2, …, a_n ) ∈ S^n be an ordered n-tuple in S.


Let R (   )j be a propositional function of j.

Then we can write the summation as:

:∑_R (   )j a_j =  The sum of all a_j such that R (   )j holds.


If more than one propositional function is written under the summation sign, they must all hold.


Such an operation on an ordered tuple is known as a summation.


Note that the definition by inequality form 1 ≤ j ≤ n is a special case of such a propositional function.

Also note that the definition by index form ∑_j  = 1^n is merely another way of writing ∑_1 ≤ j ≤ n.

Hence all instances of a summation can be expressed in terms of a propositional function.


=== Iverson's Convention ===
Let ∑_R (   )j a_j be the summation over all a_j such that j satisfies R.


This can also be expressed:
:∑_j ∈ℤ a_j [ R (   )j ]
where [ R (   )j ] is Iverson's convention.

=== Iverson's Convention ===
Let ∑_R (   )j a_j be the summation over all a_j such that j satisfies R.

Definition:Digraph,Directed,"A digraph is a graph each of whose edges has a direction:



In the above graph, the vertices are v_1, v_2, v_3 and v_4.


=== Arc ===
Let G = ( V, E ) be a digraph.

The arcs are the elements of E.

Informally, an arc is a line that joins one vertex to another.


If e ∈ E is an arc joining the vertex u to the vertex v, it is denoted u v.


=== Endvertex ===
Let D = ( V, E ) be a digraph.

Let e = u v be an arc of D, that is, e ∈ E.


The endvertices of e are the vertices u and v.


=== Initial Vertex ===
Let D = ( V, E ) be a digraph.

Let e = u v be an arc of D, that is, e ∈ E.


The initial vertex of e is the endvertex u which e is incident from.

=== Final Vertex ===
Let D = ( V, E ) be a digraph.

Let e = u v be an arc of D, that is, e ∈ E.


The final vertex of e is the endvertex v which e is incident to.

In the above graph, the arcs are v_1 v_2, v_2 v_4, v_4 v_3, v_4 v_1 and v_1 v_4.


As can be seen, in this general definition it is allowable for an arc to go in both directions between a given pair of vertices.


=== Formal Definition ===



A directed graph or digraph D is a non-empty set V together with an antireflexive relation E on V.

The elements of E are the arcs.


Thus the above digraph can be defined as:

:D = ( V, E ):
::V = { v_1, v_2, v_3, v_4 }
::E = {( v_1, v_2 ), ( v_2, v_4 ), ( v_4, v_3 ), ( v_4, v_1 ), ( v_1, v_4 )  }

=== Category-Theoretic Definition ===
Let 𝐒𝐞𝐭 be the category of sets.

A digraph is an arrangement of the following form in 𝐒𝐞𝐭:

::<0em,0em>*E = ""E"",
<5em,0em>*V = ""V"",

""E""+/^.3em/+/r1em/;""V""+/^.3em/+/l1em/ **@- ?>*@> ?*!/_.6em/s,
""E""+/_.3em/+/r1em/;""V""+/_.3em/+/l1em/ **@- ?>*@> ?*!/^.6em/t,

=== Symmetric Digraph ===
Let D = ( V, E ) be a digraph such that the relation E in D is symmetric.

Then D is called a symmetric digraph.


It follows from the definition of a (simple) graph that a symmetric digraph is in fact the same thing as an undirected graph.

=== Simple Digraph ===
Let D = ( V, E ) be a digraph.

If the relation E in D is also specifically asymmetric, then D is called a simple digraph.

That is, in a simple digraph there are no pairs of arcs (like there are between v_1 and v_4 in the diagram above) which go in both directions between two vertices."

: there exists a bijective differentiable strictly increasing real function:
:: ϕ: [c  . .  d] →[a  . .  b]

Definition:Proof System,System,"Let ℒ be a formal language.


A proof system 𝒫 for ℒ comprises:

* Axioms and/or axiom schemata;
* Rules of inference for deriving theorems.


It is usual that a proof system does this by declaring certain arguments concerning ℒ to be valid.

Informally, a proof system amounts to a precise account of what constitutes a (formal) proof.


=== Rule of Inference ===
Let ℒ be a formal language.

Part of defining a proof system 𝒫 for ℒ is to specify its rules of inference.


A rule of inference is a specification of a valid means to conclude new theorems in 𝒫 from given theorems and axioms of 𝒫.

Often, the formulation of rules of inference also appeals to the notion of provable consequence to be able to deal with assumptions as part of a proof.

=== Axiom ===
Let ℒ be a formal language.

Part of defining a proof system 𝒫 for ℒ is to specify its axioms.


An axiom of 𝒫 is a well-formed formula of ℒ that 𝒫 approves of by definition.


=== Axiom Schema ===
Let ℒ be a formal language.

Part of defining a proof system 𝒫 for ℒ is to specify its axiom schemata.


An axiom schema is a well-formed formula ϕ of ℒ, except for it containing one or more variables which are outside ℒ itself.

This formula can then be used to represent an infinite number of individual axioms in one statement.


Namely, each of these variables is allowed to take a specified range of values, most commonly WFFs.

Each WFF ψ that results from ϕ by a valid choice of values for all the variables is then an axiom of 𝒫.

=== Formal Proof ===
Let 𝒫 be a proof system for a formal language ℒ.


Let ϕ be a WFF of ℒ.

A formal proof of ϕ in 𝒫 is a collection of axioms and rules of inference of 𝒫 that leads to the conclusion that ϕ is a theorem of 𝒫.


The term formal proof is also used to refer to specific presentations of such collections.

For example, the term applies to tableau proofs in natural deduction."
Definition:Independent Proof System,System,"Let ℒ be a logical language.

* Proofs whose structure can be viewed as rooted trees.

Specific instances may deviate from this general scheme at some points.

Let ( a, b ) be an ordered pair.

The following terminology is used:
:a is called the first coordinate
:b is called the second coordinate.

This definition is compatible with the equivalent definition in the context of Cartesian coordinate systems.

=== Origin ===
The origin of a coordinate system is the zero vector.

In the x y-plane, it is the point:
:O = ( 0, 0 )

:O = ( 0, 0, …, 0 ) _n coordinates

=== Abstract System ===

A mathematical system 𝒮 = ( E, O, A ) is classed as abstract  if and only if  the elements of E and O are defined only by their properties as specified in A.


=== Concrete System ===

A mathematical system 𝒮 = ( E, O, A ) is classed as concrete  if and only if  the elements of E and O are understood as objects independently of their existence in 𝒮 itself.


The distinction between abstract and concrete is of questionable value from a modern standpoint, as it is a moot point, for example, as to whether the natural numbers exist independently of Peano's axioms or are specifically defined by them.


=== Algebraic System ===

A mathematical system 𝒮 = ( E, O, A ) is classed as algebraic  if and only if  it has many of the properties of the set of integers.

This is usually because such a system is itself an abstraction of certain properties of the integers.

The axioms are usually not considered as separate entities from the operations, as their nature is implicit in the operations themselves.

At 59 the pattern stops, and the number 60 is represented by the digit 1 once again.

Thus these groupings were placed side by side:
:the rightmost grouping would indicate a number from 1 to 59
:the one to the left of that would indicate a number from 60 × 1 to 60 × 59
and so on, each grouping further to the left indicating another multiplication by 60


For fractional numbers there was no actual radix point. Instead, the distinction was inferred by context.


The fact that they had no symbol to indicate the zero digit means that this was not a true positional numeral system as such.


For informal everyday arithmetic, they used a decimal system which was the decimal part of the full sexagesimal system."
Definition:Number-Naming System,System,"There are various number-naming systems for naming large numbers (that is: greater than 1   000   000).

=== Range ===
Let S be a set of observations of a quantitative variable.


The range of S is defined as:

Let ℕ denote the natural numbers.


For each m ∈ℕ, recursively define e_m: ℕ→ℕ to be the mapping:
:e_m (n) = 
1     : n = 0 

m × e_m (x)     : n = x + 1
where:
: + denotes natural number addition.
: × denotes natural number multiplication.


e_m (n) is then expressed as a binary operation in the form:
:m^n := e_m (n)

and is called m to the power of n.

=== Integers ===

Let n ∈ℤ be an integer.

The expression x^n is called x to the power of n.

x^n is defined recursively as:


:x^n =  1     : n = 0

Let m ∈ℤ be an integer.

Let y = √(x) be the mth root of x.


Then we can write y = x^1/m which means the same thing as y = √(x).


Thus we can define the power to a positive rational number:

Let r =  p q ∈ℚ be a positive rational number where p ∈ℤ_≥ 0, q ∈ℤ_> 0.

Then x^r is defined as:
:x^r = x^p/q = ( √(x))^p = √(( x^p ) )


When r = -p q ∈ℚ: r < 0 we define:
:x^r = x^-p/q =  1 x^p/q
analogously for the negative integer definition.

=== Real Numbers ===
Let x ∈ℝ_>0 be a (strictly) positive real number.

Let r ∈ℝ be a real number.


We define x^r as:

:x^r := exp(   )r ln x
where exp denotes the exponential function.


This definition is an extension of the definition for rational r.

This follows from Logarithms of Powers and Exponential of Natural Logarithm: it can be seen that:
:∀ r ∈ℚ: exp(   )r ln x = exp(   )ln(   )x^r = x^r

 

=== Complex Numbers ===
Let z, k ∈ℂ be complex numbers.


z to the power of k is defined as the multifunction:

where the powers on the   are integer powers.


Category:Definitions/Analysis

=== Power of Zero ===
Let r ∈ℝ be a real number.

(This includes the situation where r ∈ℤ or r ∈ℚ.)

When x=0, x^r is defined as follows:

:0^r = 
1     : r = 0 

0     : r > 0 
Undefined    : r < 0

This takes account of the awkward case 0^0: it is ""generally accepted"" that 0^0 = 1 as this convention agrees with certain general results which would otherwise need a special case."

=== Upper Bound of Number ===
When considering the upper bound of a set of numbers, it is commonplace to ignore the set and instead refer just to the number itself.

Thus the construction:

:The set of numbers which fulfil the propositional function P (   )n is bounded above with the upper bound N

would be reported as:

:The number n such that P (   )n has the upper bound N.


This construct obscures the details of what is actually being stated. Its use on   is considered an abuse of notation and so discouraged.


This also applies in the case where it is the upper bound of a mapping which is under discussion.

If, at the end of processing an input word w, s ∈ A, the finite state machine is said to accept w, otherwise to reject it.


The set of words w accepted by the machine F is called the accepted language L(F).

Category:Definitions/Abstract Machines"
Definition:Unlimited Register Machine,Machine,"An unlimited register machine, abbreviated URM, is an abstract machine with the following characteristics:


=== Registers ===
A URM has a sequence of registers which can store natural numbers: { 0, 1, 2, …}.

Any given URM program may make use of only a finite number of these registers.


Registers are usually referred to by the subscripted uppercase letters R_1, R_2, R_3, ….

The number held at any one time by a register is usually referred to by the corresponding lowercase letter r_1, r_2, r_3, ….


The registers are unlimited in the following two senses:
:(1): Although a URM program may make use of only a finite number of registers, there is no actual upper bound on how many a particular URM program can actually use.
:(2): There is no upper bound on the size of the natural numbers that may be stored in any register.


=== Index of Register ===
The subscript (which is a natural number) appended to a URM register is called the index of that register.

Hence, for example, the index of register R_5 is 5.

=== Program ===
The numbers held in the registers of a URM are manipulated according to a program.

A URM program is a finite sequence of basic instructions.


=== Basic Instruction ===
The basic instructions of a URM program form a finite sequence and hence can be considered a set indexed by the (positive) integer 1, 2, 3, ….


The basic instructions are as follows:


Name     	Notation          	Effect                     	Description
Zero     	Z (   )n        	0 → R_n                	Replace the number in R_n by 0.
Successor	S (   )n        	r_n + 1 → R_n          	Add 1 to the number in R_n.
Copy     	C (   )m, n   	r_m → R_n              	Replace the number in R_n by the number in R_m (leaving the one in R_m as it was).
Jump     	J (   )m, n, q	r_m = r_n ? ⇒ q	If the numbers in R_m and R_n are equal, go to instruction number q, otherwise go to the next instruction.



=== Execution ===
The operation of carrying out a basic URM instruction is referred to as execution.

=== Execution ===
The operation of carrying out a basic URM instruction is referred to as execution.

=== Line Number ===
For historical reasons, the index of an instruction in a given URM program is called its line number.

We can refer either to the line of the program or the line in the URM.

=== Set of All URM Programs ===
It is convenient to use U to stand for the set of all URM programs.

=== Length of Program ===
Let U denote the set of all URM programs.

Let P ∈ U be a URM program.

By definition, P is a finite sequence of basic instructions.


We define the function λ:  U →ℕ as follows:
:∀ P ∈ U: λ(   )P = the number of basic instructions that comprise P

Thus λ(   )P is referred to as the length of P.

=== Highest Register ===
Let U denote the set of all URM programs.

Let P ∈ U be a URM program.

By definition, P uses a finite number of registers.


We define the function ρ:  U →ℕ as follows:
:∀ P ∈ U: ρ(   )P = the highest register number used by P

That is, in any URM program P, no instruction refers to any register with index greater than ρ(   )P.

=== Highest Register ===
Let U denote the set of all URM programs.

Let P ∈ U be a URM program.

By definition, P uses a finite number of registers.


We define the function ρ:  U →ℕ as follows:
:∀ P ∈ U: ρ(   )P = the highest register number used by P

That is, in any URM program P, no instruction refers to any register with index greater than ρ(   )P.

=== Termination ===
A URM program terminates when there are no more instructions to execute.

This can happen in either of two ways:
:(1): If the program executes the last instruction, and this does not involve a Jump to an earlier instruction, the program will stop.
:(2): If the program executes a Jump instruction to a non-existent instruction, the program will stop.


=== Exit Jump ===
 

Such a Jump instruction is known as an exit jump .

=== Exit Line ===
 

The line on which a particular run of a URM program stops is called the exit line.


=== Endless Loop ===
 

If a URM program, when running, never reaches a state where it terminates, then it is said to be in an endless loop and will never terminate.

 

Note that whether a program terminates or not may depend on its input.

It may terminate perfectly well for one input, but go into an endless loop on another.

=== Input ===

The input to a URM program is:
:either an ordered k-tuple ( n_1, n_2, …, n_k ) ∈ℕ^k
:or a natural number n ∈ℕ.


In the latter case, it is convenient to consider a single natural number as an ordered 1-tuple ( n_1 ) ∈ℕ^1 = ℕ.

Hence we can discuss inputs to URM programs solely as instances of tuples, and not be concerned with cumbersome repetition for the cases where k = 1 and otherwise.


The convention usually used is for a URM program P to start computation with:
:the input (n_1, n_2, …, n_k) in registers R_1, R_2, …, R_k
:0 in all other registers used by P.


That is, the initial state of the URM is:
:∀ i ∈[ 1  . . ]k: r_i = n_i
:∀ i > k: r_i = 0.


It is usual for the input (either all or part) to be overwritten during the course of the operation of a program. That is, at the end of a program, R_1, R_2, …, R_k are not guaranteed still to contain n_1, n_2, …, n_k unless the program has been explicitly written so as to ensure that this is the case.


=== Output ===

At the end of the running of a URM program, the output will be found in register R_1.

=== Operation ===
When a URM runs a program, it always starts by executing the first instruction of the program.

When it has executed an instruction, it moves to the next instruction and executes that one, unless required otherwise by a Jump instruction.


=== Execution ===
The operation of carrying out a basic URM instruction is referred to as execution.

=== Instruction Pointer ===
The line number of the instruction which is currently about to be executed is known as the instruction pointer.

It can be imagined as a special-purpose register in the URM whose purpose is to hold that line number.

=== Stage of Computation ===
The stage of computation (or just stage) of a URM program is the count of how many instructions have been executed.

Thus each stage corresponds to the processing of one instruction.

=== State ===
The state of a URM program at a particular stage is defined as:
:(1): the value of the instruction pointer
:(2): the values contained by each of the registers that are used by the URM program.

=== Instruction Pointer ===
The line number of the instruction which is currently about to be executed is known as the instruction pointer.

It can be imagined as a special-purpose register in the URM whose purpose is to hold that line number.

=== Stage of Computation ===

Thus each stage corresponds to the processing of one instruction.

=== State ===
The state of a URM program at a particular stage is defined as:
:(1): the value of the instruction pointer
:(2): the values contained by each of the registers that are used by the URM program.

=== Input ===

The input to a URM program is:
:either an ordered k-tuple ( n_1, n_2, …, n_k ) ∈ℕ^k
:or a natural number n ∈ℕ.


In the latter case, it is convenient to consider a single natural number as an ordered 1-tuple ( n_1 ) ∈ℕ^1 = ℕ.

Hence we can discuss inputs to URM programs solely as instances of tuples, and not be concerned with cumbersome repetition for the cases where k = 1 and otherwise.


The convention usually used is for a URM program P to start computation with:
:the input (n_1, n_2, …, n_k) in registers R_1, R_2, …, R_k
:0 in all other registers used by P.


That is, the initial state of the URM is:
:∀ i ∈[ 1  . . ]k: r_i = n_i
:∀ i > k: r_i = 0.


It is usual for the input (either all or part) to be overwritten during the course of the operation of a program. That is, at the end of a program, R_1, R_2, …, R_k are not guaranteed still to contain n_1, n_2, …, n_k unless the program has been explicitly written so as to ensure that this is the case.


=== Output ===

At the end of the running of a URM program, the output will be found in register R_1.


=== Null Program ===
The null URM program is a URM program which contains no instructions.

That is, a URM program whose length is zero."
Definition:Turing Machine,Machine,"A Turing machine is an abstract machine which works by manipulating symbols on an imaginary piece of paper by means of a specific set of algorithmic rules.

To simplify things, the piece of paper being worked on is in the form of a series of boxes on a one-dimensional ""tape"" divided into squares.

Each square can be either blank or can contain a symbol taken from a finite set, e.g. s_1, s_2, …, s_α.


The machine examines one square at a time, and carries out an action determined by both:
:(1): the symbol in the square
:(2): the current internal state of the machine.

The internal state of the machine is a way of providing a device that can keep track of the symbols in other squares.

There can be only a finite set of these states, say q_1, q_2, …, q_β.


The actions that the machine can take are as follows:
:(1): Replace the symbol in the square with another symbol
:(2): Move to examine the square in the immediate left of the current square being looked at
:(3): Move to examine the square in the immediate right of the current square being looked at.

After carrying out an action, the machine may change to a different internal state.


The program for the machine is a set of instructions which specify:
:(1): what action to take in some possible combinations of the internal state and symbol in the square currently being read
:(2): which internal state the machine moves into after carrying out that action.

Thus the instructions have the following form:
:q_i    s_j    A    q_t
which is interpreted as:

""If:
:* the machine is in internal state q_i
: the symbol in the square currently being examined is s_j
then:
: Carry out action A
: Move into internal state q_t.


The actions can be abbreviated to:
: L: Move one square to the left
: R: Move one square to the right
: s_k: Replace the symbol in the square currently being read with symbol s_k.


The computation stops when there is no instruction which specifies what should be done in the current combination of internal state and symbol being read.

=== Formal Definition ===
 

A Turing machine is a 7-tuple ( Q, x3a3, Γ, δ, q_0, B, F ) that satisfies the following:
* Q is a finite set, the states of the machine.
* x3a3 is a finite set, the input symbols.
* Γ⊋x3a3 is a finite superset of the input symbols, called the tape symbols.
** For convenience, we also require that Γ and Q are disjoint.
* δ : Q ×Γ→ Q ×Γ×{ L, R } is a partial mapping, the transition function.
** L and R are arbitrary constants called directions.
* q_0 ∈ Q is a distinguished state called the start state.
* B ∈Γ is a distinguished tape symbol called the blank symbol. B must not be an element of x3a3.
* F ⊂ Q be a designated subset of the states called accepting states.


An instantaneous description of a Turing machine is a finite sequence of elements of Γ∪ Q, subject to the following conditions:
* There is exactly one element of Q in the sequence.
* The first entry in the sequence is not B.
* The last entry in the sequence is not in Q.
* If the last entry in the sequence is B, then the second-to-last is in Q.

By this definition, an instantaneous description can always be written as:
:X_m X_m-1… X_2 X_1 q Y Z_1 Z_2 … Z_n-1 Z_n
where m or n may be 0; X_i, Y, and Z_j are all elements of Γ; and q is an element of Q.

Additionally, X_m and Z_n are not B if they exist; that is, if m and n are not 0, respectively.


A move reduces one instantaneous description into another by applying the transition function.

We write A ⊢ B if a machine with instantaneous description A has, after a single move, instantaneous description B.

Let δ(   )q, Y = ( q', Y', d ).

Then there are seven cases to consider:

* If d = L and m > 0, and either n > 0 or Y' ≠ B then:
:X_m … X_2 X_1 q Y Z_1 … Z_n ⊢ X_m … X_2 q' X_1 Y' Z_1 … Z_n

* If d = L and m > 0, but n = 0 and Y' = B then:
:X_m … X_2 X_1 q Y ⊢ X_m … X_2 q' X_1

* If d = L but m = 0, and either n > 0 or Y' ≠ B then:
:q Y Z_1 … Z_n ⊢ q' B Y' Z_1 … Z_n

* If d = R and n > 0, and either m > 0 or Y' ≠ B then:
:X_m … X_1 q Y Z_1 Z_2 … Z_n ⊢ X_m … X_1 Y' q' Z_1 Z_2 … Z_n

* If d = R and n > 0, but m = 0 and Y' = B then:
:q Y Z_1 Z_2 … Z_n ⊢ q' Z_1 Z_2 … Z_n

* If d = R but n = 0, and either m > 0 or Y' ≠ B then:
:X_m … X_1 q Y ⊢ X_m … X_1 Y' q' B

* If m = 0, n = 0, and Y' = B then regardless of d:
:q Y ⊢ q' B


Let A ⊢^* B indicate that there exists a finite sequence ⟨ A_i ⟩_0 ≤ i ≤ n such that:
:A = A_0 ⊢ A_1 ⊢ A_2 ⊢…⊢ A_n = B


The language L (   )M accepted by the machine M is the set of strings w ∈x3a3^* for which, for some α, β∈Γ^* and p ∈ F:
:q_0 w ⊢^* α p β

As a special case, the null string is in the language  if and only if  the above holds for w = B.


A machine M halts on an input w, using the same special case for the null string as above,  if and only if  for some α, β∈Γ^*, X ∈Γ, and q ∈ Q:
:q_0 w ⊢^* α q X β
where δ(   )q, X is undefined."
Definition:Nondeterministic Turing Machine,Machine,"A Nondeterministic (or Non-deterministic) Turing Machine (NTM) is a variation of the classical Turing machine that relaxes the restriction that all the steps in the machine must be definite.

That is, given a single internal state and a single character being read on the tape the machine may have more than one possible response.

If any sequence of choices puts the machine into a halting state, then the machine stops after n steps, where n is the minimum number of steps needed to put the machine into a halting state.

 

=== Formal Definition ===

A nondeterministic Turing machine is a 7-tuple ( Q, x3a3, Γ, δ, q_0, B, F ) that satisfies the following:
* Q is a finite set, the states of the machine.
* x3a3 is a finite set, the input symbols.
* Γ⊋x3a3 is a finite superset of the input symbols, called the tape symbols.
** For convenience, we also require that Γ and Q are disjoint.
* δ : Q ×Γ→𝒫( Q ×Γ×{ L, R }) is a mapping, the transition function.
** L and R are arbitrary constants called directions.
* q_0 ∈ Q is a distinguished state called the start state.
* B ∈Γ is a distinguished tape symbol called the blank symbol. B must not be an element of x3a3.
* F ⊂ Q be a designated subset of the states called accepting states.


An instantaneous description of a nondeterministic Turing machine is a finite sequence of elements of Γ∪ Q, subject to the following conditions:
* There is exactly one element of Q in the sequence.
* The first entry in the sequence is not B.
* The last entry in the sequence is not in Q.
* If the last entry in the sequence is B, then the second-to-last is in Q.

By this definition, an instantaneous description can always be written as:

Additionally, X_m and Z_n are not B if they exist; that is, if m and n are not 0, respectively.


A move reduces one instantaneous description into another by applying the transition function. There may be many possible moves from any given instantaneous description.

We write A ⊢ B if a machine with instantaneous description A may have, after a single move, instantaneous description B.

Let ( q', Y', d ) ∈δ(   )q, Y.

Then there are seven cases to consider:

It allows one to specify that a logical formula should (temporarily) be regarded as being a single entity, being on the same level as a statement variable.

Typically, a formal language, in defining its formal grammar, ensures by means of parenthesis that all of its well-formed words are uniquely readable.


Generally, brackets are used to indicate that certain formulas are in parenthesis.

The brackets that are mostly used are round ones, the left (round) bracket ( and the right (round) bracket )."

However, there are problems with the  . If we allow it to be used without any restrictions at all, paradoxes arise, the most famous example probably being Russell's Paradox.

=== Notation ===
The conventional notation for x is a divisor of y is ""x | y"", but there is a growing trend to follow the notation ""x \ y"", as espoused by   etc.

From  :
:The notation 'm | n' is actually much more common than 'm \ n' in current mathematics literature. But vertical lines are overused – for absolute values, set delimiters, conditional probabilities, etc. – and backward slashes are underused. Moreover, 'm \ n' gives an impression that m is the denominator of an implied ratio. So we shall boldly let our divisibility symbol lean leftward.


An unfortunate unwelcome side-effect of this notational convention is that to indicate non-divisibility, the conventional technique of implementing / through the notation looks awkward with \, so \ is eschewed in favour of ∤.


Some sources use | -10mu  3pt - or similar to denote non-divisibility.

A complex number is an ordered pair ( x, y ) where x, y ∈ℝ are real numbers, on which the operations of addition and multiplication are defined as follows:


=== Complex Addition ===
Let ( x_1, y_1 ) and ( x_2, y_2 ) be complex numbers.

Then ( x_1, y_1 ) + ( x_2, y_2 ) is defined as:

:( x_1, y_1 ) + ( x_2, y_2 ):= ( x_1 + x_2, y_1 + y_2 )

=== Construction from Cayley-Dickson Construction ===
The complex numbers can be defined by the Cayley-Dickson construction from the set of real numbers ℝ.

From Real Numbers form Algebra, ℝ forms a nicely normed *-algebra.

Let a, b ∈ℝ.

Then ( a, b ) ∈ℂ, where:

:( a, b ) ( c, d ) = ( a c - d b, a d + c b )
:( a, b )  = ( a, -b )
where:
:a is the conjugate of a
and 
:( a, b ) is the conjugation operation on ℂ.

From Real Numbers form Algebra, a = a and so the above translate into:

:( a, b ) ( c, d ) = ( a c - d b, a d + c b )
:( a, b )  = ( a, -b )


It is clear by direct comparison with the formal definition that this construction genuinely does generate the complex numbers."

Definition:Degrees of Freedom (Statistics),Degrees of Freedom,"The number of degrees of freedom is essentially the number of independent units of information in a sample relevant to the estimation of a parameter or calculation of a statistic.

One approach is to regard the n observations as the initial data, one of which is used to determine the total or mean.

As the mean must be known before we can determine deviations from it, there are n - 1 degrees of freedom left to estimate the variance.

Hence, in the sense that the total is fixed, only n - 1 values can be assigned arbitrarily, as the remaining one is then fixed to ensure the correct total."

Definition:Quadratic Form (Polynomial Theory),Quadratic Form,A quadratic form is a form whose variables are of degree 2.
Definition:Argument of Complex Number,Argument,"Let z = x + i y be a complex number.

An argument of z, or z, is formally defined as a solution to the pair of equations:
:(1):    x | z | = cos(   ) z
:(2):    y | z | = sin(   ) z
where | z | is the modulus of z.

From Sine and Cosine are Periodic on Reals, it follows that if θ is an argument of z, then so is θ + 2 k π where k ∈ℤ is any integer.


Thus, the argument of a complex number z is a continuous multifunction.

 


=== Principal Range ===
It is understood that the argument of a complex number z is unique only up to multiples of 2 k π.

With this understanding, we can limit the choice of what θ can be for any given z by requiring that θ lie in some half open interval of length 2 π.

The most usual of these are:
:[ 0  . . )2 π
:( -π . . ]π

but in theory any such interval may be used.

This interval is known as the principal range.

=== Principal Argument ===
Let R be the principal range of the complex numbers ℂ.

The unique value of θ in R is known as the principal argument, of z.

This is denoted Arg( z ).

Note the capital A.

The standard practice is for R to be ( -π . . ]π.

This ensures that the principal argument is continuous on the real axis for positive numbers.

Thus, if z is represented in the complex plane, the principal argument Arg( z ) is intuitively defined as the angle which z yields with the real (y = 0) axis.


 "
Definition:Logical Argument,Argument,"A logical argument (or just argument) is a process of creating a new statement from one or more existing statements.

An argument proceeds from a set of premises to a conclusion, by means of logical implication, via a procedure called logical inference.


An argument may have more than one premise, but only one conclusion.


While statements may be classified as either true or false, an argument may be classified as either valid or invalid.


Loosely speaking, a valid argument is one that leads unshakeably from true statements to other true statements, whereas an invalid argument is one that can lead you to, for example, a false statement from one which is true.


Thus:
:An argument may be valid, even though its premises are false.
:An argument may be invalid, even though its premises are true.
:An argument may be invalid and its premises false.

It is even possible for the conclusion of an argument to be true, even though the argument is invalid and its premises are false.


To be sure of the truth of a conclusion, it is necessary to make sure both that the premises are true and that the argument is valid.


However, while you may not actually know whether a statement is true or not, you can investigate the consequences of it being either true or false, and see what effect that has on the truth value of the proposition(s) of which it is a part. That, in short, is what the process of logical argument consists of.


An argument may be described symbolically by means of sequents, which specify the flow of an argument.


=== Finitary Argument ===
A finitary argument is a logical argument which starts with a finite number of axioms, and can be translated into a finite number of statements."
