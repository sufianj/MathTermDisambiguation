Definition:Logical Not,Negation,"The logical not or (logical) negation operator is a unary connective whose action is to reverse the truth value of the statement on which it operates.

:p is defined as:
:p is not true
:It is not the case that p is true
:It is false that p
:p is false.


Thus the statement p is called the negation of p.


p is voiced not p.


=== Truth Function ===
The logical not connective defines the truth function f^ as follows:

 
 
 
 

=== Truth Table ===
The characteristic truth table of the negation operator p is as follows:

:[ p p; F T; T F;   ]

=== Boolean Interpretation ===
Let 𝐀 be a propositional formula.

Let  denote the negation operator.


The truth value of 𝐀 under a boolean interpretation v is given by:

:v (   )𝐀 = T    : v (   )𝐀 = F
F    : v (   )𝐀 = T"

Definition:Content of Polynomial,Content,"=== Integer Polynomial ===
Let f ∈ℤ[ X ] be a polynomial with integer coefficients.

Then the content of f, denoted cont( f ), is the greatest common divisor of the coefficients of f.

=== Rational Polynomial ===
Let f ∈ℚ[ X ] be a polynomial with rational coefficients.


The content of f is defined as:
:cont( f ) := cont( n f )  n
where n ∈ℕ is such that n f ∈ℤ[ X ].

=== Polynomial in GCD Domain ===
Let D be a GCD domain.

Let K be the field of quotients of D.

Let f ∈ K [ X ] be a polynomial.

Let a ∈ D be such that a f ∈ D [ X ].

Let d be the greatest common divisor of the coefficients of a f.

Then we define the content of f to be:
:cont( f ) :=  d a"

Definition:Like Vector Quantities,Like,"Let 𝐚 and 𝐛 be vector quantities.

Then 𝐚 and 𝐛 are known as like vector quantities  if and only if  they have the same direction."
Definition:Electric Charge/Polarity/Like,Like,"If 2 electric charges are of the same polarity, they are referred to as being like (electric) charges.


The usage is archaic; the word one would expect is alike."
Definition:Polygon/Internal Angle,Interior Angle,"The internal angle of a vertex of a polygon is the size of the angle between the sides adjacent to that vertex, as measured inside the polygon."
Definition:Transversal (Geometry)/Interior Angle,Interior Angle,":


An interior angle of a transversal is an angle which is between the two lines cut by that transversal.

In the above figure, the interior angles with respect to the transversal EF are:
:∠ AHJ
:∠ CJH
:∠ BHJ
:∠ DJH"
