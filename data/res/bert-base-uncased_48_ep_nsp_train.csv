=== Rational Numbers ===
Let x ∈ℝ be a real number such that x > 0.

Let m ∈ℤ be an integer.

Let y = √(x) be the mth root of x.


Then we can write y = x^1/m which means the same thing as y = √(x).


Thus we can define the power to a positive rational number:

Let r =  p q ∈ℚ be a positive rational number where p ∈ℤ_≥ 0, q ∈ℤ_> 0.

Then x^r is defined as:
:x^r = x^p/q = ( √(x))^p = √(( x^p ) )


When r = -p q ∈ℚ: r < 0 we define:
:x^r = x^-p/q =  1 x^p/q
analogously for the negative integer definition.

=== Real Numbers ===
Let x ∈ℝ_>0 be a (strictly) positive real number.

Let r ∈ℝ be a real number.


We define x^r as:

:x^r := exp(   )r ln x
where exp denotes the exponential function.


This definition is an extension of the definition for rational r.

This follows from Logarithms of Powers and Exponential of Natural Logarithm: it can be seen that:
:∀ r ∈ℚ: exp(   )r ln x = exp(   )ln(   )x^r = x^r

 

=== Complex Numbers ===
Let z, k ∈ℂ be complex numbers.


z to the power of k is defined as the multifunction:

:z^k := e^k ln( z )

where:
:e^z is the exponential function
:ln is the  natural logarithm multifunction.


=== Principal Branch ===
The principal branch of a complex number raised to a complex power is defined as:

:z^k = e^k Ln z

where Ln z is the principal branch of the natural logarithm.


=== Positive Real Base ===
Let t > 0 be a real number and let k be a complex number.


The principal branch of a positive real number raised to a complex power is defined as:

:t^k = e^k ln t

where ln is the natural logarithm of a positive real number.

=== Power of Zero ===
Let r ∈ℝ be a real number.

(This includes the situation where r ∈ℤ or r ∈ℚ.)

When x=0, x^r is defined as follows:

:0^r = 
1     : r = 0 

0     : r > 0 
Undefined    : r < 0

This takes account of the awkward case 0^0: it is ""generally accepted"" that 0^0 = 1 as this convention agrees with certain general results which would otherwise need a special case.",Definition:Power (Algebra)

To denote the dual of an ordering, the conventional technique is to reverse the symbol.

Thus:
:≽ denotes ≼^-1
:≽ denotes ≼^-1
:⋟ denotes ⋞^-1

:a ≼ b  b ≽ a
:a ≼ b  b ≽ a
:a ⋞ b  b ⋟ a

:≥ denotes ≤^-1
:⩾ denotes ⩽^-1
:⪖ denotes ⪕^-1

=== Notation for Dual Strict Ordering ===
To denote the dual of an strict ordering, the conventional technique is to reverse the symbol.

Let ( x_1, y_1 ) and ( x_2, y_2 ) be complex numbers.


Then ( x_1, y_1 ) ( x_2, y_2 ) is defined as:

:( x_1, y_1 ) ( x_2, y_2 ) := ( x_1 x_2 - y_1 y_2, x_1 y_2 + y_1 x_2 )

=== Scalar Product ===
Let ( x, y ) be a complex number.

Let m ∈ℝ be a real number.


Then m ( x, y ) is defined as:

:m ( x, y ) := ( m x, m y )

=== Construction from Cayley-Dickson Construction ===
The complex numbers can be defined by the Cayley-Dickson construction from the set of real numbers ℝ.

From Real Numbers form Algebra, ℝ forms a nicely normed *-algebra.

Let a, b ∈ℝ.

Then ( a, b ) ∈ℂ, where:

:( a, b ) ( c, d ) = ( a c - d b, a d + c b )
:( a, b )  = ( a, -b )
where:
:a is the conjugate of a
and 
:( a, b ) is the conjugation operation on ℂ.

From Real Numbers form Algebra, a = a and so the above translate into:

:( a, b ) ( c, d ) = ( a c - d b, a d + c b )
:( a, b )  = ( a, -b )


It is clear by direct comparison with the formal definition that this construction genuinely does generate the complex numbers.",Definition:Complex Number

=== Independent Variable ===

Let f (   )z = w.


Then z is referred to as an independent variable (of f).

Then the (complex) conjugate of z is denoted z and is defined as:

:z := a - i b


That is, you get the complex conjugate of a complex number by negating its imaginary part.


=== Complex Conjugation ===
The operation of complex conjugation is the mapping:
: ·: ℂ→ℂ: z ↦z.
where z is the complex conjugate of z.


That is, it maps a complex number to its complex conjugate.

This is called the operation induced on 𝒫( S ) by ∘, and A ∘_𝒫 B is called the subset product of A and B.


It is usual to write A ∘ B for A ∘_𝒫 B.


=== Subset Product with Singleton ===

When one of the subsets in a subset product is a singleton, we can (and often do) dispose of the set braces. Thus:
Let ( S, ∘) be an algebraic structure.


Let A ⊆ S be a subset of S.

181,Definition:Unlimited Register Machine,Machine,"An unlimited register machine, abbreviated URM, is an abstract machine with the following characteristics:


=== Registers ===
A URM has a sequence of registers which can store natural numbers: { 0, 1, 2, …}.

Any given URM program may make use of only a finite number of these registers.


Registers are usually referred to by the subscripted uppercase letters R_1, R_2, R_3, ….

The number held at any one time by a register is usually referred to by the corresponding lowercase letter r_1, r_2, r_3, ….


The registers are unlimited in the following two senses:
:(1): Although a URM program may make use of only a finite number of registers, there is no actual upper bound on how many a particular URM program can actually use.
:(2): There is no upper bound on the size of the natural numbers that may be stored in any register.


=== Index of Register ===
The subscript (which is a natural number) appended to a URM register is called the index of that register.

Hence, for example, the index of register R_5 is 5.

=== Program ===
The numbers held in the registers of a URM are manipulated according to a program.

A URM program is a finite sequence of basic instructions.


=== Basic Instruction ===
The basic instructions of a URM program form a finite sequence and hence can be considered a set indexed by the (positive) integer 1, 2, 3, ….


The basic instructions are as follows:


Name     	Notation          	Effect                     	Description
Zero     	Z (   )n        	0 → R_n                	Replace the number in R_n by 0.
Successor	S (   )n        	r_n + 1 → R_n          	Add 1 to the number in R_n.
Copy     	C (   )m, n   	r_m → R_n              	Replace the number in R_n by the number in R_m (leaving the one in R_m as it was).
Jump     	J (   )m, n, q	r_m = r_n ? ⇒ q	If the numbers in R_m and R_n are equal, go to instruction number q, otherwise go to the next instruction.



=== Execution ===
The operation of carrying out a basic URM instruction is referred to as execution.

=== Execution ===
The operation of carrying out a basic URM instruction is referred to as execution.

=== Line Number ===
For historical reasons, the index of an instruction in a given URM program is called its line number.

We can refer either to the line of the program or the line in the URM.

=== Set of All URM Programs ===
It is convenient to use U to stand for the set of all URM programs.

=== Length of Program ===
Let U denote the set of all URM programs.

Let P ∈ U be a URM program.

By definition, P is a finite sequence of basic instructions.


We define the function λ:  U →ℕ as follows:
:∀ P ∈ U: λ(   )P = the number of basic instructions that comprise P

Thus λ(   )P is referred to as the length of P.

=== Highest Register ===
Let U denote the set of all URM programs.

Let P ∈ U be a URM program.

By definition, P uses a finite number of registers.


We define the function ρ:  U →ℕ as follows:
:∀ P ∈ U: ρ(   )P = the highest register number used by P

That is, in any URM program P, no instruction refers to any register with index greater than ρ(   )P.

=== Highest Register ===
Let U denote the set of all URM programs.

Let P ∈ U be a URM program.

By definition, P uses a finite number of registers.


We define the function ρ:  U →ℕ as follows:
:∀ P ∈ U: ρ(   )P = the highest register number used by P

That is, in any URM program P, no instruction refers to any register with index greater than ρ(   )P.

=== Termination ===
A URM program terminates when there are no more instructions to execute.

This can happen in either of two ways:
:(1): If the program executes the last instruction, and this does not involve a Jump to an earlier instruction, the program will stop.
:(2): If the program executes a Jump instruction to a non-existent instruction, the program will stop.


=== Exit Jump ===
 

Such a Jump instruction is known as an exit jump .

=== Exit Line ===
 

The line on which a particular run of a URM program stops is called the exit line.


=== Endless Loop ===
 

If a URM program, when running, never reaches a state where it terminates, then it is said to be in an endless loop and will never terminate.

 

Note that whether a program terminates or not may depend on its input.

It may terminate perfectly well for one input, but go into an endless loop on another.

=== Input ===

The input to a URM program is:
:either an ordered k-tuple ( n_1, n_2, …, n_k ) ∈ℕ^k
:or a natural number n ∈ℕ.


In the latter case, it is convenient to consider a single natural number as an ordered 1-tuple ( n_1 ) ∈ℕ^1 = ℕ.

Hence we can discuss inputs to URM programs solely as instances of tuples, and not be concerned with cumbersome repetition for the cases where k = 1 and otherwise.


The convention usually used is for a URM program P to start computation with:
:the input (n_1, n_2, …, n_k) in registers R_1, R_2, …, R_k
:0 in all other registers used by P.


That is, the initial state of the URM is:
:∀ i ∈[ 1  . . ]k: r_i = n_i
:∀ i > k: r_i = 0.


It is usual for the input (either all or part) to be overwritten during the course of the operation of a program. That is, at the end of a program, R_1, R_2, …, R_k are not guaranteed still to contain n_1, n_2, …, n_k unless the program has been explicitly written so as to ensure that this is the case.


=== Output ===

At the end of the running of a URM program, the output will be found in register R_1.

=== Operation ===
When a URM runs a program, it always starts by executing the first instruction of the program.

When it has executed an instruction, it moves to the next instruction and executes that one, unless required otherwise by a Jump instruction.


=== Execution ===
The operation of carrying out a basic URM instruction is referred to as execution.

=== Instruction Pointer ===
The line number of the instruction which is currently about to be executed is known as the instruction pointer.

It can be imagined as a special-purpose register in the URM whose purpose is to hold that line number.

=== Stage of Computation ===
The stage of computation (or just stage) of a URM program is the count of how many instructions have been executed.

Thus each stage corresponds to the processing of one instruction.

=== State ===
The state of a URM program at a particular stage is defined as:
:(1): the value of the instruction pointer
:(2): the values contained by each of the registers that are used by the URM program.

At the end of the running of a URM program, the output will be found in register R_1.


=== Null Program ===
The null URM program is a URM program which contains no instructions.

That is, a URM program whose length is zero.",Definition:Unlimited Register Machine
182,Definition:Turing Machine,Machine,"A Turing machine is an abstract machine which works by manipulating symbols on an imaginary piece of paper by means of a specific set of algorithmic rules.

To simplify things, the piece of paper being worked on is in the form of a series of boxes on a one-dimensional ""tape"" divided into squares.

Each square can be either blank or can contain a symbol taken from a finite set, e.g. s_1, s_2, …, s_α.


The machine examines one square at a time, and carries out an action determined by both:
:(1): the symbol in the square
:(2): the current internal state of the machine.

The internal state of the machine is a way of providing a device that can keep track of the symbols in other squares.

There can be only a finite set of these states, say q_1, q_2, …, q_β.


The actions that the machine can take are as follows:
:(1): Replace the symbol in the square with another symbol
:(2): Move to examine the square in the immediate left of the current square being looked at
:(3): Move to examine the square in the immediate right of the current square being looked at.

After carrying out an action, the machine may change to a different internal state.


The program for the machine is a set of instructions which specify:
:(1): what action to take in some possible combinations of the internal state and symbol in the square currently being read
:(2): which internal state the machine moves into after carrying out that action.

Thus the instructions have the following form:
:q_i    s_j    A    q_t
which is interpreted as:

""If:
:* the machine is in internal state q_i
: the symbol in the square currently being examined is s_j
then:
: Carry out action A
: Move into internal state q_t.


The actions can be abbreviated to:
: L: Move one square to the left
: R: Move one square to the right
: s_k: Replace the symbol in the square currently being read with symbol s_k.


The computation stops when there is no instruction which specifies what should be done in the current combination of internal state and symbol being read.

=== Formal Definition ===
 

A Turing machine is a 7-tuple ( Q, x3a3, Γ, δ, q_0, B, F ) that satisfies the following:
* Q is a finite set, the states of the machine.
* x3a3 is a finite set, the input symbols.
* Γ⊋x3a3 is a finite superset of the input symbols, called the tape symbols.
** For convenience, we also require that Γ and Q are disjoint.
* δ : Q ×Γ→ Q ×Γ×{ L, R } is a partial mapping, the transition function.
** L and R are arbitrary constants called directions.
* q_0 ∈ Q is a distinguished state called the start state.
* B ∈Γ is a distinguished tape symbol called the blank symbol. B must not be an element of x3a3.
* F ⊂ Q be a designated subset of the states called accepting states.


An instantaneous description of a Turing machine is a finite sequence of elements of Γ∪ Q, subject to the following conditions:
* There is exactly one element of Q in the sequence.
* The first entry in the sequence is not B.
* The last entry in the sequence is not in Q.
* If the last entry in the sequence is B, then the second-to-last is in Q.

By this definition, an instantaneous description can always be written as:
:X_m X_m-1… X_2 X_1 q Y Z_1 Z_2 … Z_n-1 Z_n
where m or n may be 0; X_i, Y, and Z_j are all elements of Γ; and q is an element of Q.

Additionally, X_m and Z_n are not B if they exist; that is, if m and n are not 0, respectively.


A move reduces one instantaneous description into another by applying the transition function.

We write A ⊢ B if a machine with instantaneous description A has, after a single move, instantaneous description B.

:X_m … X_1 q Y Z_1 Z_2 … Z_n ⊢ X_m … X_1 Y' q' Z_1 Z_2 … Z_n

* If d = R and n > 0, but m = 0 and Y' = B then:
:q Y Z_1 Z_2 … Z_n ⊢ q' Z_1 Z_2 … Z_n

* If d = R but n = 0, and either m > 0 or Y' ≠ B then:

183,Definition:Nondeterministic Turing Machine,Machine,"A Nondeterministic (or Non-deterministic) Turing Machine (NTM) is a variation of the classical Turing machine that relaxes the restriction that all the steps in the machine must be definite.

That is, given a single internal state and a single character being read on the tape the machine may have more than one possible response.

If any sequence of choices puts the machine into a halting state, then the machine stops after n steps, where n is the minimum number of steps needed to put the machine into a halting state.

Additionally, X_m and Z_n are not B if they exist; that is, if m and n are not 0, respectively.


A move reduces one instantaneous description into another by applying the transition function. There may be many possible moves from any given instantaneous description.

We write A ⊢ B if a machine with instantaneous description A may have, after a single move, instantaneous description B.

=== Formal Definition ===



A directed graph or digraph D is a non-empty set V together with an antireflexive relation E on V.

Let D = ( V, E ) be a digraph.

If the relation E in D is also specifically asymmetric, then D is called a simple digraph.

The orientation of the y-axis is determined by the position of P' relative to O.

It is conventional to locate P' such that, if one were to imagine being positioned at O and facing along the x-axis towards P, then P' is on the left.

Identify one distinct point in space as the origin O.

Let 3 distinct planes be constructed through O such that all are perpendicular.

Each pair of these 3 planes intersect in a straight line that passes through O.

Let X, Y and Z be points, other than O, one on each of these 3 lines of intersection.


Then the lines OX, OY and OZ are named the x-axis, y-axis and z-axis respectively.


Select a point P on the x-axis different from O.

Let P be identified with the coordinate pair ( 1, 0 ) in the x-y plane.

Identify the point P' on the y-axis such that OP' = OP.

Identify the point P' ' on the z-axis such that OP' ' = OP.


=== Orientation ===


Consider a Cartesian 3-Space.

Let the x-axis, y-axis and z-axis be defined.


Let a point P be identified on the x-axis, different from O, with the coordinate pair ( 1, 0 ) in the x-y plane.

Let the point P' be identified on the y-axis such that OP' = OP.


It remains to identify the point P'  ' on the z-axis such that OP' ' = OP.

The orientation of the z-axis is determined by the position of P' ' relative to O.


The Cartesian 3-Space is defined as right-handed when P' ' is located as follows.

Let the coordinate axes be oriented as follows:

Imagine being positioned, standing on the x-y plane at O, and facing along the x-axis towards P, with P' on the left. 

Then P' ' is then one unit above the x-y plane.


Hence, let the coordinate axes be oriented as follows:

:Let the x-axis increase from West to East.
:Let the y-axis increase from South to North.

Then the z-axis increases from below to above.


Simiarly, let the x-y plane be identified with the plane of the page or screen such aligned perpendicular to the line of sight such that:

:the x-axis increases from left to right.
:the y-axis increases from bottom to top.

Then the z-axis increases from behind to in front (that is, from further away to closer in).

872,Definition:Argument of Complex Number,Argument,"Let z = x + i y be a complex number.

An argument of z, or z, is formally defined as a solution to the pair of equations:
:(1):    x | z | = cos(   ) z
:(2):    y | z | = sin(   ) z
where | z | is the modulus of z.

From Sine and Cosine are Periodic on Reals, it follows that if θ is an argument of z, then so is θ + 2 k π where k ∈ℤ is any integer.


Thus, the argument of a complex number z is a continuous multifunction.

 


=== Principal Range ===
It is understood that the argument of a complex number z is unique only up to multiples of 2 k π.

With this understanding, we can limit the choice of what θ can be for any given z by requiring that θ lie in some half open interval of length 2 π.

The most usual of these are:
:[ 0  . . )2 π
:( -π . . ]π

but in theory any such interval may be used.

This interval is known as the principal range.

=== Principal Argument ===
Let R be the principal range of the complex numbers ℂ.

The unique value of θ in R is known as the principal argument, of z.

This is denoted Arg( z ).

Note the capital A.

The standard practice is for R to be ( -π . . ]π.

This ensures that the principal argument is continuous on the real axis for positive numbers.

Thus, if z is represented in the complex plane, the principal argument Arg( z ) is intuitively defined as the angle which z yields with the real (y = 0) axis.


 ",Definition:Argument of Complex Number
873,Definition:Logical Argument,Argument,"A logical argument (or just argument) is a process of creating a new statement from one or more existing statements.

An argument proceeds from a set of premises to a conclusion, by means of logical implication, via a procedure called logical inference.


An argument may have more than one premise, but only one conclusion.


While statements may be classified as either true or false, an argument may be classified as either valid or invalid.


Loosely speaking, a valid argument is one that leads unshakeably from true statements to other true statements, whereas an invalid argument is one that can lead you to, for example, a false statement from one which is true.


Thus:
:An argument may be valid, even though its premises are false.
:An argument may be invalid, even though its premises are true.
:An argument may be invalid and its premises false.

It is even possible for the conclusion of an argument to be true, even though the argument is invalid and its premises are false.


To be sure of the truth of a conclusion, it is necessary to make sure both that the premises are true and that the argument is valid.


However, while you may not actually know whether a statement is true or not, you can investigate the consequences of it being either true or false, and see what effect that has on the truth value of the proposition(s) of which it is a part. That, in short, is what the process of logical argument consists of.


An argument may be described symbolically by means of sequents, which specify the flow of an argument.

Let ⟨ x_n ⟩ be bounded above by H ∈ℝ.


Then H is an upper bound of ⟨ x_n ⟩.


=== Upper Bound of Number ===
When considering the upper bound of a set of numbers, it is commonplace to ignore the set and instead refer just to the number itself.

Thus the construction:

:The set of numbers which fulfil the propositional function P (   )n is bounded above with the upper bound N

would be reported as:

:The number n such that P (   )n has the upper bound N.


This construct obscures the details of what is actually being stated. Its use on   is considered an abuse of notation and so discouraged.


This also applies in the case where it is the upper bound of a mapping which is under discussion.

The k-cycle ρ is denoted:
:[             i       ρ(   )i             … ρ^k - 1(   )i ]


From Existence and Uniqueness of Cycle Decomposition, all permutations can be defined as the product of disjoint cycles.

As Disjoint Permutations Commute, the order in which they are performed does not matter.


So, for a given permutation ρ, the cycle notation for ρ consists of all the disjoint cycles into which ρ can be decomposed, concatenated as a product.

It is conventional to omit 1-cycles from the expression, and to write those cycles with lowest starting number first.


=== Canonical Representation ===
The permutation:

:[ 1 2 3 4 5; 2 1 4 3 5 ]

can be expressed in cycle notation as:

:[ 1 2 ][ 3 4 ]

or as:

:[ 3 4 ][ 5 ][ 1 2 ]

or as:

:[ 4 3 ][ 2 1 ]

etc.

:⟨ G_i ⟩_i ∈[ 0  . . ]n = ( { e } = G_0  G_1 ⋯ G_n - 1 G_n = G )


The factor groups of ⟨ G_i ⟩_i ∈[ 0  . . ]n:
:{ e } = G_0  G_1 ⋯ G_n = G

are the quotient groups:
:G_1 / G_0, G_2 / G_1, …, G_i / G_i - 1, …, G_n / G_n-1

=== Normal Series as Sequence of Homomorphisms ===
Let G be a group whose identity is e.

Let ⟨ G_i ⟩_i ∈[ 0  . . ]n be a normal series for G:
:⟨ G_i ⟩_i ∈[ 0  . . ]n = ( { e } = G_0  G_1 ⋯ G_n - 1 G_n = G )
whose factor groups are:
:H_1 = G_1 / G_0, H_2 = G_2 / G_1, …, H_i = G_i / G_i - 1, …, H_n = G_n / G_n - 1


By Kernel of Group Homomorphism Corresponds with Normal Subgroup of Domain, such a series can also be expressed as a sequence ϕ_1, …, ϕ_n of group homomorphisms:

:{ e }ϕ_1→ H_1 ϕ_2→ H_2 ϕ_3→⋯ϕ_n→ H_n

=== Infinite Normal Series ===
A normal series may or may not terminate at either end:
:⋯ϕ_i - 1⟶ H_i - 1ϕ_i⟶ H_i ϕ_i + 1⟶ H_i + 1ϕ_i + 2⟶⋯

Such a series is referred to as an infinite normal series.

The context will determine which end, if either, it terminates.

=== Length ===
Let G be a group whose identity is e.

Let ⟨ G_i ⟩_i ∈[ 0  . . ]n be a normal series for G:
:⟨ G_i ⟩_i ∈[ 0  . . ]n = ( { e } = G_0  G_1 ⋯ G_n-1 G_n = G )


The length of ⟨ G_i ⟩_i ∈[ 0  . . ]n is the number of (normal) subgroups which make it.

In this context, the length of ⟨ G_i ⟩_i ∈[ 0  . . ]n is n.


If such a normal series is infinite, then its length is not defined.

=== Notation ===
The conventional notation for x is a divisor of y is ""x | y"", but there is a growing trend to follow the notation ""x \ y"", as espoused by   etc.

From  :
:The notation 'm | n' is actually much more common than 'm \ n' in current mathematics literature. But vertical lines are overused – for absolute values, set delimiters, conditional probabilities, etc. – and backward slashes are underused. Moreover, 'm \ n' gives an impression that m is the denominator of an implied ratio. So we shall boldly let our divisibility symbol lean leftward.


An unfortunate unwelcome side-effect of this notational convention is that to indicate non-divisibility, the conventional technique of implementing / through the notation looks awkward with \, so \ is eschewed in favour of ∤.


Some sources use | -10mu  3pt - or similar to denote non-divisibility.

:sup_R (   )j a_j :=  the supremum of all a_j such that R (   )j holds


If more than one propositional function is written under the supremum sign, they must all hold.


=== Finite Range ===
Let ⟨ a_j ⟩_j ∈ I be a family of elements of the real numbers ℝ indexed by I.

Let R (   )j be a propositional function of j ∈ I.


Let the fiber of truth of R (   )j be finite.

Then the supremum of ⟨ a_j ⟩_j ∈ I can be expressed as:

:max_R (   )j a_j =  the maxmum of all a_j such that R (   )j holds

and can be referred to as the maximum of ⟨ a_j ⟩_j ∈ I.


If more than one propositional function is written under the supremum sign, they must all hold.

=== Vacuous Supremum ===
Take the indexed supremum:
:sup _Φ(   )j a_j
where Φ(   )j is a propositional function of j.

Suppose that there are no values of j for which Φ(   )j is true.

Then sup_Φ(   )j a_j is defined as being -∞.

This supremum is called a vacuous supremum.


This is because:
:∀ a ∈ℝ: sup{ a, -∞} = a

Hence for all j for which Φ(   )j is false, the supremum is unaffected.


In this context -∞ is considered as minus infinity, the hypothetical quantity that has the property:

The diagonal relation on V is the relation Δ_V on V defined as:

:Δ_V = {( x, x ): x ∈ V }

Alternatively:

:Δ_V = {( x, y ): x, y ∈ V: x = y }",Definition:Diagonal Relation
1426,Definition:Diagonal Mapping,Diagonal,"Let S be a set.

Let S × S be the Cartesian product of S with itself.


Then the diagonal mapping on S is defined as Δ: S → S × S:
:∀ x ∈ S: Δ(x) = (x, x)


Clearly Δ is an injection, and is not a surjection unless S is a singleton.

=== Definition by Remainder after Division ===
Let z ∈ℝ.


We define a relation ℛ_z on the set of all x, y ∈ℝ:
:ℛ_z := {( x, y ) ∈ℝ×ℝ: ∃ k ∈ℤ: x = y + k z }


This relation is called congruence modulo z, and the real number z is called the modulus.


When ( x, y ) ∈ℛ_z, we write:
:x ≡ y  z
and say:
:x is congruent to y modulo z.


Similarly, when ( x, y ) ∉ℛ_z, we write:
:x ≢y  z
and say:
:x is not congruent (or incongruent) to y modulo z.

=== Definition by Modulo Operation ===
Let z ∈ℝ.

Let  be defined as the modulo operation:

:x  y :=  x - y ⌊ x y ⌋    : y  0 
 x     : y = 0


Then congruence modulo z is the relation on ℝ defined as:
:∀ x, y ∈ℝ: x ≡ y  z  x  z = y  z 


The real number z is called the modulus.

=== Definition by Integer Multiple ===
Let z ∈ℝ.

Let x, y ∈ℝ.


Then x is congruent to y modulo z  if and only if  their difference is an integer multiple of z:
