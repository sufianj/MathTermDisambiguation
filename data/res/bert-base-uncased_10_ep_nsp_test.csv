Then we can write:

Let ( R, +, ∘) be a ring.

Let 𝐀 = [ a ]_m n be an m × n matrix over R.

Let 𝐁 = [ b ]_n p be an n × p matrix over R.

Then the matrix product of 𝐀 and 𝐁 is written 𝐀𝐁 and is defined as follows.

Let 𝐀𝐁 = 𝐂 = [ c ]_m p.


Then:
:∀ i ∈[ 1  . . ]m, j ∈[ 1  . . ]p: c_i j = ∑_k  = 1^n a_i k∘ b_k j


Thus [ c ]_m p is the m × p matrix where each entry c_i j is built by forming the (ring) product of each entry in the i'th row of 𝐀 with the corresponding entry in the j'th column of 𝐁 and adding up all those products.


This operation is called matrix multiplication, and 𝐂 is the matrix product of 𝐀 with 𝐁.


It follows that matrix multiplication is defined whenever the first matrix has the same number of columns as the second matrix has rows.


=== Pre-Multiplication ===
Let ( R, +, ∘) be a ring.

Let 𝐀 = [ a ]_m n be an m × n matrix over R.

Let 𝐀 = [ a ]_m n be an m × n matrix over R.

Let 𝐁 = [ b ]_n p be an n × p matrix over R.


Let 𝐀𝐁 be the product of 𝐀 with 𝐁.

Then 𝐀 is post-multiplied by 𝐁.

=== Using Einstein Summation Convention ===
Let ( R, +, ∘) be a ring.

Let 𝐀 = [ a ]_m n be an m × n matrix over R.

Let 𝐁 = [ b ]_n p be an n × p matrix over R.


The matrix product of 𝐀 and 𝐁 can be expressed using the Einstein summation convention as:

Then:
:c_i j := a_i k∘ b_k j


The index which appears twice in the expressions on the   is the entry k, which is the one summated over.

=== Conformable Matrices ===
Let 𝐀 and 𝐁 be matrices.

It needs to be emphasised that matrix product can be defined on 𝐀 and 𝐁  if and only if  𝐀 and 𝐁 are conformable.


That is, if the number of rows of one is equal to the number of columns of the other.

=== Matrix Scalar Product ===
Let 𝔽 denote one of the standard number systems.

Let ℳ(   )m, n be the m × n matrix space over 𝔽.

Let 𝐀 = [ a ]_m n∈ℳ(   )m, n.

Let λ∈𝔽 be any element of F.


The operation of scalar multiplication of 𝐀 by λ is defined as follows.

Let λ𝐀 = 𝐂.

Then:
:∀ i ∈[ 1  . . ]m, j ∈[ 1  . . ]n: c_i j = λ a_i j

λ𝐀 is the scalar product of λ and 𝐀.

Let ( R, +, ∘) be a ring.

Let 𝐀 = [ a ]_m n be an m × n matrix over ( R, +, ∘).

=== Kronecker Product ===

Also known as matrix direct product:

Let 𝐀 = [ a ]_m n and 𝐁 = [ b ]_p q be matrices.

The Kronecker product of 𝐀 and 𝐁 is denoted 𝐀⊗𝐁 and is defined as the block matrix:

:𝐀⊗𝐁 = [ a_11𝐁 a_12𝐁     ⋯ a_1n𝐁; a_21𝐁 a_22𝐁     ⋯ a_2n𝐁;     ⋮     ⋮     ⋱     ⋮; a_m1𝐁 a_m2𝐁     ⋯ a_mn𝐁 ]


Writing this out in full:

:𝐀⊗𝐁 = [ a_11 b_11 a_11 b_12         ⋯ a_11 b_1q         ⋯         ⋯ a_1n b_11 a_1n b_12         ⋯ a_1n b_1q; a_11 b_21 a_11 b_22         ⋯ a_11 b_2q         ⋯         ⋯ a_1n b_21 a_1n b_22         ⋯ a_1n b_2q;         ⋮         ⋮         ⋱         ⋮                             ⋮         ⋮         ⋱         ⋮; a_11 b_p1 a_11 b_p2         ⋯ a_11 b_pq         ⋯         ⋯ a_1n b_p1 a_1n b_p2         ⋯ a_1n b_pq;         ⋮         ⋮                   ⋮         ⋱                   ⋮         ⋮                   ⋮;         ⋮         ⋮                   ⋮                   ⋱         ⋮         ⋮                   ⋮; a_m1 b_11 a_m1 b_12         ⋯ a_m1 b_1q         ⋯         ⋯ a_mn b_11 a_mn b_12         ⋯ a_mn b_1q; a_m1 b_21 a_m1 b_22         ⋯ a_m1 b_2q         ⋯         ⋯ a_mn b_21 a_mn b_22         ⋯ a_mn b_2q;         ⋮         ⋮         ⋱         ⋮                             ⋮         ⋮         ⋱         ⋮; a_m1 b_p1 a_m1 b_p2         ⋯ a_m1 b_pq         ⋯         ⋯ a_mn b_p1 a_mn b_p2         ⋯ a_mn b_pq ]


Thus, if:
:𝐀 is a matrix with order m × n
:𝐁 is a matrix with order p × q

then 𝐀⊗𝐁 is a matrix with order m p × n q.

=== Hadamard Product ===

Also known as Matrix Entrywise Product or Schur Product:

Let 𝐀 = [ a ]_m n and 𝐁 = [ b ]_m n be m × n matrices over a ring ( R, +, ×).


The Hadamard product of 𝐀 and 𝐁 is written 𝐀∘𝐁 and is defined as follows:

:𝐀∘𝐁 := 𝐂 = [ c ]_m n

where:

:∀ i ∈[ 1  . . ]m, j ∈[ 1  . . ]n: c_i j = a_i j× b_i j

In this situation, P is called a (binary) product of A and B and may be denoted A × B.

A proof system 𝒫 for ℒ comprises:

* Axioms and/or axiom schemata;
* Rules of inference for deriving theorems.


It is usual that a proof system does this by declaring certain arguments concerning ℒ to be valid.

Informally, a proof system amounts to a precise account of what constitutes a (formal) proof.


=== Rule of Inference ===
Let ℒ be a formal language.

Part of defining a proof system 𝒫 for ℒ is to specify its rules of inference.


A rule of inference is a specification of a valid means to conclude new theorems in 𝒫 from given theorems and axioms of 𝒫.

Often, the formulation of rules of inference also appeals to the notion of provable consequence to be able to deal with assumptions as part of a proof.

=== Axiom ===
Let ℒ be a formal language.

Part of defining a proof system 𝒫 for ℒ is to specify its axioms.


An axiom of 𝒫 is a well-formed formula of ℒ that 𝒫 approves of by definition.


=== Axiom Schema ===
Let ℒ be a formal language.

Part of defining a proof system 𝒫 for ℒ is to specify its axiom schemata.


An axiom schema is a well-formed formula ϕ of ℒ, except for it containing one or more variables which are outside ℒ itself.

This formula can then be used to represent an infinite number of individual axioms in one statement.


Namely, each of these variables is allowed to take a specified range of values, most commonly WFFs.

Each WFF ψ that results from ϕ by a valid choice of values for all the variables is then an axiom of 𝒫.

=== Formal Proof ===
Let 𝒫 be a proof system for a formal language ℒ.


Let ϕ be a WFF of ℒ.

A formal proof of ϕ in 𝒫 is a collection of axioms and rules of inference of 𝒫 that leads to the conclusion that ϕ is a theorem of 𝒫.


The term formal proof is also used to refer to specific presentations of such collections.

For example, the term applies to tableau proofs in natural deduction.",Definition:Proof System

=== Multiple Indices ===
Let ∑_0 ≤ j ≤ n a_j denote the summation of ( a_0, a_1, a_2, …, a_n ).


Summands with multiple indices can be denoted by propositional functions in several variables, for example:

:∑_0 ≤ i ≤ n( ∑_0 ≤ j ≤ n a_i j) = ∑_0 ≤ i, j ≤ n a_i j


:∑_0 ≤ i ≤ n( ∑_0 ≤ j ≤ i a_i j) = ∑_0 ≤ j ≤ i ≤ n a_i j

=== Definition by Propositional Function ===
Let ( S, + ) be an algebraic structure where the operation + is an operation derived from, or arising from, the addition operation on the natural numbers.

Let ( a_1, a_2, …, a_n ) ∈ S^n be an ordered n-tuple in S.


Let R (   )j be a propositional function of j.

Then we can write the summation as:

:∑_R (   )j a_j =  The sum of all a_j such that R (   )j holds.


If more than one propositional function is written under the summation sign, they must all hold.


Such an operation on an ordered tuple is known as a summation.


Note that the definition by inequality form 1 ≤ j ≤ n is a special case of such a propositional function.

Also note that the definition by index form ∑_j  = 1^n is merely another way of writing ∑_1 ≤ j ≤ n.

Hence all instances of a summation can be expressed in terms of a propositional function.

Let ∑_R (   )j a_j be the summation over all a_j such that j satisfies R.


This can also be expressed:

A rotation r_θ in space is an isometry on the Euclidean Space Γ = ℝ^3 as follows.


Let AB be a distinguished straight line in Γ, which has the property that:
:∀ P ∈ AB: r_θ(   )P = P

That is, all points on AB map to themselves.


Let P ∈Γ such that P ∉ AB.

Let a straight line be constructed from P to O on AB such that OP is perpendicular to AB.

Let a straight line OP' be constructed perpendicular to AB such that:
:(1):    OP' = OP
:(2):   ∠ POP' = θ such that OP → OP' is in the anticlockwise direction:


:


Then:
:r_θ(   )P = P'

Thus r_θ is a rotation (in space) of (angle) θ about (the axis) O.


 

=== Axis of Rotation ===
Let r_θ be a rotation in the Euclidean Space Γ = ℝ^n.


The set A of points in Γ such that:
:∀ P ∈ A: r_θ(   )P = P

is called the axis of rotation of r_θ.

=== Vector Form ===
A space rotation r_θ can be expressed as an axial vector 𝐫_θ such that:
:the direction of 𝐫_θ is defined to be its axis of rotation
:the length of 𝐫_θ specifies its angle of rotation of 𝐫_θ to an appropriate scale.

:

=== Right-Hand Rule ===
Let 𝐕 be an axial vector acting with respect to an axis of rotation R.

Consider a right hand with its fingers curled round R so that the fingers are pointed in the direction of rotation of 𝐕 around R.


The right-hand rule is the convention that the direction of 𝐕 is the direction in which the thumb is pointing:

When a proof is valid, we may say one of the following:
* The conclusion follows from the premises;
* The premises entail the conclusion;
* The conclusion is true on the strength of the premises;
* The conclusion is drawn from the premises;
* The conclusion is deduced from the premises;
* The conclusion is derived from the premises.


=== Proof ===

If all the premises of a valid argument are true, then the conclusion must also therefore be true.

It is not possible for the premises of a valid argument to be true, but for the conclusion to be false.

A proof is a valid argument whose premises are all true.


Hence a valid argument that has one or more false premises is not a proof.


Suppose P is a proposition whose truth or falsehood is to be determined.

Constructing a valid argument upon a set of premises, all of which have previously been established as being true, is called proving P.

An ℒ-automorphism j is an A-automorphism  if and only if  j (   )a = a for all a∈ A.

An ℒ-automorphism j is an A, b-automorphism  if and only if  it is an ( A ∪{ b })-automorphism; that is: j (   )a = a for all a ∈ A and also j (   )b = b.",Definition:Embedding (Galois Theory)

407,Definition:Set Intersection,Intersection,"Let S and T be sets.


The (set) intersection of S and T is written S ∩ T.

It means the set which consists of all the elements which are contained in both of S and T:

:x ∈ S ∩ T  x ∈ S  x ∈ T

or, more formally:

:A = S ∩ T ∀ z: ( z ∈ A  z ∈ S  z ∈ T )


We can write:

:S ∩ T := { x: x ∈ S  x ∈ T }

and can voice it S intersect T.


It can be seen that, in this form, ∩ is a binary operation which acts on sets.


One often says that two sets intersect  if and only if  they have non-empty intersection.


=== Set of Sets ===
Let S be a set of sets.

The intersection of S is:
:⋂ S := { x: ∀ S ∈ S: x ∈ S }
That is, the set of all objects that are elements of all the elements of S.


Thus:
:⋂{ S, T } := S ∩ T

=== Family of Sets ===
Let I be an indexing set.

Then the intersection of ⟨ S_i ⟩ is defined as:

:⋂_i ∈ I S_i := { x: ∀ i ∈ I: x ∈ S_i }


=== In the context of the Universal Set ===

In treatments of set theory in which the concept of the universal set is recognised, this can be expressed as follows.

Let 𝕌 be a universal set.

Let I be an indexing set.

Let ⟨ S_i ⟩_i ∈ I be an indexed family of subsets of 𝕌.


Then the intersection of ⟨ S_i ⟩ is defined and denoted as:

:⋂_i ∈ I S_i := { x ∈𝕌: ∀ i ∈ I: x ∈ S_i }

=== Subsets of General Set ===
This definition is the same when the universal set 𝕌 is replaced by any set X, which may or may not be a universal set:

Let I be an indexing set.

Let ⟨ S_i ⟩_i ∈ I be an indexed family of subsets of a set X.


Then the intersection of ⟨ S_i ⟩ is defined as:

:⋂_i ∈ I S_i := { x ∈ X: ∃ i ∈ I: x ∈ S_i }
where i is a bound variable.

=== Countable Intersection ===
Let 𝕊 be a set of sets.

Let ⟨ S_n ⟩_n ∈ℕ be a sequence in 𝕊.

Let S be the intersection of ⟨ S_n ⟩_n ∈ℕ:
:S = ⋂_n ∈ℕ S_n


Then S is a countable intersection of sets in 𝕊.

=== Finite Intersection ===
Let S = S_1 ∩ S_2 ∩…∩ S_n.

Then:
:S = ⋂_i ∈ℕ^*_n S_i := { x: ∀ i ∈ℕ^*_n: x ∈ S_i }
where ℕ^*_n = { 1, 2, 3, …, n }.


If it is clear from the context that i ∈ℕ^*_n, we can also write ⋂_ℕ^*_n S_i.",Definition:Intersection (Geometry)
