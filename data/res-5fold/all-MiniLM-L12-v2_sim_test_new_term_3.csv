The expression x^n is called x to the power of n.

x^n is defined recursively as:


:x^n =  1     : n = 0 
   
 x × x^n - 1    : n > 0 
   
x^n + 1 x     : n < 0

where x^n + 1 x denotes division.


=== Even Power ===
Let x ∈ℝ be a real number.

=== Odd Power ===

=== Rational Numbers ===
Let x ∈ℝ be a real number such that x > 0.

Let m ∈ℤ be an integer.

Let y = √(x) be the mth root of x.


Then we can write y = x^1/m which means the same thing as y = √(x).


Thus we can define the power to a positive rational number:

Let r =  p q ∈ℚ be a positive rational number where p ∈ℤ_≥ 0, q ∈ℤ_> 0.

Then x^r is defined as:
:x^r = x^p/q = ( √(x))^p = √(( x^p ) )


When r = -p q ∈ℚ: r < 0 we define:
:x^r = x^-p/q =  1 x^p/q
analogously for the negative integer definition.

=== Real Numbers ===
Let x ∈ℝ_>0 be a (strictly) positive real number.

Let r ∈ℝ be a real number.


We define x^r as:

:x^r := exp(   )r ln x
where exp denotes the exponential function.


This definition is an extension of the definition for rational r.

This follows from Logarithms of Powers and Exponential of Natural Logarithm: it can be seen that:
:∀ r ∈ℚ: exp(   )r ln x = exp(   )ln(   )x^r = x^r

 

=== Complex Numbers ===
Let z, k ∈ℂ be complex numbers.


z to the power of k is defined as the multifunction:

:z^k := e^k ln( z )

where:
:e^z is the exponential function
:ln is the  natural logarithm multifunction.


=== Principal Branch ===
The principal branch of a complex number raised to a complex power is defined as:

:z^k = e^k Ln z

where Ln z is the principal branch of the natural logarithm.


=== Positive Real Base ===
Let t > 0 be a real number and let k be a complex number.


The principal branch of a positive real number raised to a complex power is defined as:

:t^k = e^k ln t

where ln is the natural logarithm of a positive real number.

:x^k := ∏_j  = 1^n x_j^k_j
where the powers on the   are integer powers.

=== Power of Zero ===
Let r ∈ℝ be a real number.

(This includes the situation where r ∈ℤ or r ∈ℚ.)

When x=0, x^r is defined as follows:

:0^r =  1     : r = 0 
 0     : r > 0 
Undefined    : r < 0

This takes account of the awkward case 0^0: it is ""generally accepted"" that 0^0 = 1 as this convention agrees with certain general results which would otherwise need a special case.",Definition:Power (Algebra)

329,Definition:Valid Argument,Valid,"A valid argument is a logical argument in which the premises provide conclusive reasons for the conclusion.


When an argument is valid, we may say one of the following:
* The conclusion follows from the premises;
* The premises entail the conclusion;
* The conclusion is true on the strength of the premises;
* The conclusion is drawn from the premises;
* The conclusion is deduced from the premises;
* The conclusion is derived from the premises.


=== Proof ===

If all the premises of a valid argument are true, then the conclusion must also therefore be true.

It is not possible for the premises of a valid argument to be true, but for the conclusion to be false.

A proof is a valid argument whose premises are all true.


Hence a valid argument that has one or more false premises is not a proof.


Suppose P is a proposition whose truth or falsehood is to be determined.

Constructing a valid argument upon a set of premises, all of which have previously been established as being true, is called proving P.


=== Formal Proof ===

Let 𝒫 be a proof system for a formal language ℒ.

Let 𝒫 be a proof system for a formal language ℒ.


Let ϕ be a WFF of ℒ.

A formal proof of ϕ in 𝒫 is a collection of axioms and rules of inference of 𝒫 that leads to the conclusion that ϕ is a theorem of 𝒫.


The term formal proof is also used to refer to specific presentations of such collections.

For example, the term applies to tableau proofs in natural deduction.",Definition:Valid Argument
