Let 𝐁 = [ b ]_n p be an n × p matrix over R.

Then the matrix product of 𝐀 and 𝐁 is written 𝐀𝐁 and is defined as follows.

Let 𝐀𝐁 = 𝐂 = [ c ]_m p.


Then:
:∀ i ∈[ 1  . . ]m, j ∈[ 1  . . ]p: c_i j = ∑_k  = 1^n a_i k∘ b_k j


Thus [ c ]_m p is the m × p matrix where each entry c_i j is built by forming the (ring) product of each entry in the i'th row of 𝐀 with the corresponding entry in the j'th column of 𝐁 and adding up all those products.


This operation is called matrix multiplication, and 𝐂 is the matrix product of 𝐀 with 𝐁.


It follows that matrix multiplication is defined whenever the first matrix has the same number of columns as the second matrix has rows.

λ𝐀 is the scalar product of λ and 𝐀.

Let 𝐂 be a metacategory.

Let 𝒞 be any collection of objects of 𝐂.

Let 𝐃𝐢𝐬(   )𝒞 be the discrete category on 𝒞, considered as a subcategory of 𝐂.


A product for 𝒞, denoted ∏𝒞, is a limit for the inclusion functor D: 𝐃𝐢𝐬(   )𝒞→𝐂, considered as a diagram.


For an object C in 𝒞, the associated morphism ∏𝒞→ C is denoted pr_C and called the projection on C.

The whole construction is pictured in the following commutative diagram:

A proof system 𝒫 for ℒ comprises:

* Axioms and/or axiom schemata;
* Rules of inference for deriving theorems.

Informally, a proof system amounts to a precise account of what constitutes a (formal) proof.


=== Rule of Inference ===

A rule of inference is a specification of a valid means to conclude new theorems in 𝒫 from given theorems and axioms of 𝒫.

=== Axiom ===
Let ℒ be a formal language.

Part of defining a proof system 𝒫 for ℒ is to specify its axioms.


An axiom of 𝒫 is a well-formed formula of ℒ that 𝒫 approves of by definition.


=== Axiom Schema ===

Part of defining a proof system 𝒫 for ℒ is to specify its axiom schemata.


An axiom schema is a well-formed formula ϕ of ℒ, except for it containing one or more variables which are outside ℒ itself.

This formula can then be used to represent an infinite number of individual axioms in one statement.


Namely, each of these variables is allowed to take a specified range of values, most commonly WFFs.
