=== Informal Definition ===
A complex number is a number in the form a + b i or a + i b where:
:a and b are real numbers
:i is a square root of -1, that is, i = √(-1).

=== Formal Definition ===
A complex number is an ordered pair ( x, y ) where x, y ∈ℝ are real numbers, on which the operations of addition and multiplication are defined as follows:


=== Complex Addition ===
Let ( x_1, y_1 ) and ( x_2, y_2 ) be complex numbers.

Then + is a binary operation defined as:

:( x_1, y_1 ) + ( x_2, y_2 ):= ( x_1 + x_2, y_1 + y_2 )

=== Complex Multiplication ===
Let ( x_1, y_1 ) and ( x_2, y_2 ) be complex numbers.


Then ( x_1, y_1 ) ( x_2, y_2 ) is defined as:

:( x_1, y_1 ) ( x_2, y_2 ) := ( x_1 x_2 - y_1 y_2, x_1 y_2 + y_1 x_2 )

=== Scalar Product ===
Let ( x, y ) be a complex number.

Let m ∈ℝ be a real number.


Then m ( x, y ) is defined as:

:m ( x, y ) := ( m x, m y )

=== Construction from Cayley-Dickson Construction ===
The complex numbers can be defined by the Cayley-Dickson construction from the set of real numbers ℝ.

From Real Numbers form Algebra, ℝ forms a nicely normed *-algebra.

Let a, b ∈ℝ.

Then ( a, b ) ∈ℂ, where:

:( a, b ) ( c, d ) = ( a c - d b, a d + c b )
:( a, b )  = ( a, -b )
where:
:a is the conjugate of a
and 
:( a, b ) is the conjugation operation on ℂ.

From Real Numbers form Algebra, a = a and so the above translate into:

:( a, b ) ( c, d ) = ( a c - d b, a d + c b )
:( a, b )  = ( a, -b )


It is clear by direct comparison with the formal definition that this construction genuinely does generate the complex numbers.",Definition:Complex Number

Then the (complex) conjugate of z is denoted z and is defined as:

=== Complex Conjugation ===
The operation of complex conjugation is the mapping:
: ·: ℂ→ℂ: z ↦z.

That is, it maps a complex number to its complex conjugate.

:The notation 'm | n' is actually much more common than 'm \ n' in current mathematics literature. But vertical lines are overused – for absolute values, set delimiters, conditional probabilities, etc. – and backward slashes are underused. Moreover, 'm \ n' gives an impression that m is the denominator of an implied ratio. So we shall boldly let our divisibility symbol lean leftward.


An unfortunate unwelcome side-effect of this notational convention is that to indicate non-divisibility, the conventional technique of implementing / through the notation looks awkward with \, so \ is eschewed in favour of ∤.

207,Definition:Unlimited Register Machine,Machine,"An unlimited register machine, abbreviated URM, is an abstract machine with the following characteristics:


=== Registers ===
A URM has a sequence of registers which can store natural numbers: { 0, 1, 2, …}.

Any given URM program may make use of only a finite number of these registers.


Registers are usually referred to by the subscripted uppercase letters R_1, R_2, R_3, ….

The number held at any one time by a register is usually referred to by the corresponding lowercase letter r_1, r_2, r_3, ….


The registers are unlimited in the following two senses:
:(1): Although a URM program may make use of only a finite number of registers, there is no actual upper bound on how many a particular URM program can actually use.
:(2): There is no upper bound on the size of the natural numbers that may be stored in any register.


=== Index of Register ===
The subscript (which is a natural number) appended to a URM register is called the index of that register.

Hence, for example, the index of register R_5 is 5.

=== Program ===
The numbers held in the registers of a URM are manipulated according to a program.

A URM program is a finite sequence of basic instructions.


=== Basic Instruction ===
The basic instructions of a URM program form a finite sequence and hence can be considered a set indexed by the (positive) integer 1, 2, 3, ….


The basic instructions are as follows:


Name     	Notation          	Effect                     	Description
Zero     	Z (   )n        	0 → R_n                	Replace the number in R_n by 0.
Successor	S (   )n        	r_n + 1 → R_n          	Add 1 to the number in R_n.
Copy     	C (   )m, n   	r_m → R_n              	Replace the number in R_n by the number in R_m (leaving the one in R_m as it was).
Jump     	J (   )m, n, q	r_m = r_n ? ⇒ q	If the numbers in R_m and R_n are equal, go to instruction number q, otherwise go to the next instruction.



=== Execution ===
The operation of carrying out a basic URM instruction is referred to as execution.

=== Execution ===
The operation of carrying out a basic URM instruction is referred to as execution.

=== Line Number ===
For historical reasons, the index of an instruction in a given URM program is called its line number.

We can refer either to the line of the program or the line in the URM.

=== Set of All URM Programs ===
It is convenient to use U to stand for the set of all URM programs.

=== Length of Program ===
Let U denote the set of all URM programs.

Let P ∈ U be a URM program.

By definition, P is a finite sequence of basic instructions.


We define the function λ:  U →ℕ as follows:
:∀ P ∈ U: λ(   )P = the number of basic instructions that comprise P

Thus λ(   )P is referred to as the length of P.

=== Highest Register ===
Let U denote the set of all URM programs.

Let P ∈ U be a URM program.

By definition, P uses a finite number of registers.


We define the function ρ:  U →ℕ as follows:
:∀ P ∈ U: ρ(   )P = the highest register number used by P

That is, in any URM program P, no instruction refers to any register with index greater than ρ(   )P.

=== Highest Register ===
Let U denote the set of all URM programs.

Let P ∈ U be a URM program.

By definition, P uses a finite number of registers.


We define the function ρ:  U →ℕ as follows:
:∀ P ∈ U: ρ(   )P = the highest register number used by P

That is, in any URM program P, no instruction refers to any register with index greater than ρ(   )P.

=== Termination ===
A URM program terminates when there are no more instructions to execute.

This can happen in either of two ways:
:(1): If the program executes the last instruction, and this does not involve a Jump to an earlier instruction, the program will stop.
:(2): If the program executes a Jump instruction to a non-existent instruction, the program will stop.


=== Exit Jump ===
 

Such a Jump instruction is known as an exit jump .

=== Exit Line ===
 

The line on which a particular run of a URM program stops is called the exit line.


=== Endless Loop ===
 

If a URM program, when running, never reaches a state where it terminates, then it is said to be in an endless loop and will never terminate.

 

Note that whether a program terminates or not may depend on its input.

It may terminate perfectly well for one input, but go into an endless loop on another.

=== Input ===

The input to a URM program is:
:either an ordered k-tuple ( n_1, n_2, …, n_k ) ∈ℕ^k
:or a natural number n ∈ℕ.


In the latter case, it is convenient to consider a single natural number as an ordered 1-tuple ( n_1 ) ∈ℕ^1 = ℕ.

Hence we can discuss inputs to URM programs solely as instances of tuples, and not be concerned with cumbersome repetition for the cases where k = 1 and otherwise.


The convention usually used is for a URM program P to start computation with:
:the input (n_1, n_2, …, n_k) in registers R_1, R_2, …, R_k
:0 in all other registers used by P.


That is, the initial state of the URM is:
:∀ i ∈[ 1  . . ]k: r_i = n_i
:∀ i > k: r_i = 0.


It is usual for the input (either all or part) to be overwritten during the course of the operation of a program. That is, at the end of a program, R_1, R_2, …, R_k are not guaranteed still to contain n_1, n_2, …, n_k unless the program has been explicitly written so as to ensure that this is the case.


=== Output ===

At the end of the running of a URM program, the output will be found in register R_1.

=== Operation ===
When a URM runs a program, it always starts by executing the first instruction of the program.

When it has executed an instruction, it moves to the next instruction and executes that one, unless required otherwise by a Jump instruction.


=== Execution ===
The operation of carrying out a basic URM instruction is referred to as execution.

=== Instruction Pointer ===
The line number of the instruction which is currently about to be executed is known as the instruction pointer.

It can be imagined as a special-purpose register in the URM whose purpose is to hold that line number.

=== Stage of Computation ===
The stage of computation (or just stage) of a URM program is the count of how many instructions have been executed.

Thus each stage corresponds to the processing of one instruction.

=== State ===
The state of a URM program at a particular stage is defined as:
:(1): the value of the instruction pointer
:(2): the values contained by each of the registers that are used by the URM program.

=== Instruction Pointer ===
The line number of the instruction which is currently about to be executed is known as the instruction pointer.

:either an ordered k-tuple ( n_1, n_2, …, n_k ) ∈ℕ^k
:or a natural number n ∈ℕ.


In the latter case, it is convenient to consider a single natural number as an ordered 1-tuple ( n_1 ) ∈ℕ^1 = ℕ.

Hence we can discuss inputs to URM programs solely as instances of tuples, and not be concerned with cumbersome repetition for the cases where k = 1 and otherwise.


The convention usually used is for a URM program P to start computation with:
:the input (n_1, n_2, …, n_k) in registers R_1, R_2, …, R_k
:0 in all other registers used by P.


That is, the initial state of the URM is:
:∀ i ∈[ 1  . . ]k: r_i = n_i
:∀ i > k: r_i = 0.


It is usual for the input (either all or part) to be overwritten during the course of the operation of a program. That is, at the end of a program, R_1, R_2, …, R_k are not guaranteed still to contain n_1, n_2, …, n_k unless the program has been explicitly written so as to ensure that this is the case.


=== Output ===

At the end of the running of a URM program, the output will be found in register R_1.


=== Null Program ===
The null URM program is a URM program which contains no instructions.

That is, a URM program whose length is zero.",Definition:Unlimited Register Machine
208,Definition:Turing Machine,Machine,"A Turing machine is an abstract machine which works by manipulating symbols on an imaginary piece of paper by means of a specific set of algorithmic rules.

To simplify things, the piece of paper being worked on is in the form of a series of boxes on a one-dimensional ""tape"" divided into squares.

Each square can be either blank or can contain a symbol taken from a finite set, e.g. s_1, s_2, …, s_α.


The machine examines one square at a time, and carries out an action determined by both:
:(1): the symbol in the square
:(2): the current internal state of the machine.

The internal state of the machine is a way of providing a device that can keep track of the symbols in other squares.

There can be only a finite set of these states, say q_1, q_2, …, q_β.


The actions that the machine can take are as follows:
:(1): Replace the symbol in the square with another symbol
:(2): Move to examine the square in the immediate left of the current square being looked at
:(3): Move to examine the square in the immediate right of the current square being looked at.

After carrying out an action, the machine may change to a different internal state.


The program for the machine is a set of instructions which specify:
:(1): what action to take in some possible combinations of the internal state and symbol in the square currently being read
:(2): which internal state the machine moves into after carrying out that action.

Thus the instructions have the following form:
:q_i    s_j    A    q_t
which is interpreted as:

""If:
:* the machine is in internal state q_i
: the symbol in the square currently being examined is s_j
then:
: Carry out action A
: Move into internal state q_t.


The actions can be abbreviated to:
: L: Move one square to the left
: R: Move one square to the right
: s_k: Replace the symbol in the square currently being read with symbol s_k.


The computation stops when there is no instruction which specifies what should be done in the current combination of internal state and symbol being read.

* There is exactly one element of Q in the sequence.
* The first entry in the sequence is not B.
* The last entry in the sequence is not in Q.
* If the last entry in the sequence is B, then the second-to-last is in Q.

406,Definition:Weight (Physics),Weight,"The weight of a body is the magnitude of the force exerted on it by the influence of a gravitational field.


The context is that the gravitational field in question is usually that of the Earth.

=== Weigh ===
To weigh a body is to determine its weight, and thence its mass.

Similarly we can say that:
:body B weighs x
to mean:
:the weight of the body B is x
and both mean the same thing.

=== Dimension of Weight ===
The dimension of weight is 𝖬 𝖫 𝖳^-2: mass times acceleration, that is, a force.

=== Units of Weight ===
The SI unit of weight is N (newton).

The CGS unit of weight is dyn (dyne).",Definition:Weight (Physics)
407,Definition:Network/Weight,Weight,"Let N = ( V, E, w ) be a network with weight function w: E →ℝ.


The values of the elements of E under w are known as the weights of the edges of N.


The weights of a network N can be depicted by writing the appropriate numbers next to the edges of the underlying graph of N.


=== Weight of Walk ===
Let N = ( V, E, w ) be a network with weight function w: E →ℝ.


Let PQ = v_1 e_1 v_2 e_2 … e_n - 1 V_n be a walk in N.

The weight of PQ is defined as the sum of the weights of the edges that constitute PQ:

:w (   )PQ := ∑_k  = 1^n - 1 w (   )e_k


This definition can also be applied to paths, trails, circuits and  cycles.",Definition:Network/Weight Function

The mapping w: E →ℝ is known as the weight function of N.",Definition:Network/Weight Function
409,Definition:Weight Function,Weight,"A weight function on a set S is a mapping from S to the real numbers:
:w: S →ℝ


It is common for the requirements of a specific application under discussion for the codomain of w to be restricted to the positive reals:
:w: S →ℝ_≥ 0


The thing that determines whether a given mapping is a weight function depends more on how it is used.",Definition:Weight Function

The weight of C is the number of non-zero terms of C.",Definition:Weight of Linear Codeword
411,Definition:Weights,Weight,"A set of weights consists of a number of solid pieces of matter whose mass is measured and known.

They are used as reference masses for the purpose of determining to a certain limit of accuracy the weight of a body whose mass is unknown.
