Then ∠ DAC is the complement of ∠ BAD.


Hence, for any angle α (whether less than a right angle or not), the complement of α is π 2 - α.

Measured in degrees, the complement of α is 90^∘ - α.


If α is the complement of β, then it follows that β is the complement of α.

Hence we can say that α and β are complementary.


It can be seen from this that the complement of an angle greater than a right angle is negative.

where I_U and I_V are the identity mappings on U and V respectively.

We say that B is the inverse of A and write B = A^-1. 

The process of finding an A^-1 given A is called inverting.

=== Inner Product Space ===
Let ( V, ⟨·,   ⟩·) and ( U, ⟨·,   ⟩·) be inner product spaces.

Let A : V → U be a bounded linear transformation.


We say that A is invertible as a bounded linear transformation  if and only if :

:A has an inverse mapping that is a bounded linear transformation.


That is:

:there exists a bounded linear transformation B : U → V such that: 

::A ∘ B = I_U

195,Definition:Power (Algebra),Involution,"=== Natural Numbers ===
Let ℕ denote the natural numbers.


For each m ∈ℕ, recursively define e_m: ℕ→ℕ to be the mapping:
:e_m (   )n =  1     : n = 0 
 m × e_m (   )x     : n = x + 1
where:
:+ denotes natural number addition.
:× denotes natural number multiplication.


e_m (   )n is then expressed as a binary operation in the form:
:m^n := e_m (   )n

and is called m to the power of n.

=== Integers ===
Let x ∈ℝ be a real number.

Let n ∈ℤ be an integer.

The expression x^n is called x to the power of n.

x^n is defined recursively as:


:x^n =  1     : n = 0 
   
 x × x^n - 1    : n > 0 
   
x^n + 1 x     : n < 0

where x^n + 1 x denotes division.


=== Even Power ===
Let x ∈ℝ be a real number.

Let n ∈ℤ be an even integer.


Then x^n is called an even power of x.

=== Odd Power ===
Let x ∈ℝ be a real number.

Let n ∈ℤ be an odd integer.


Then x^n is called an odd power of x


Category:Definitions/Integer Powers
Category:Definitions/Odd Integers

=== Rational Numbers ===
Let x ∈ℝ be a real number such that x > 0.

Let m ∈ℤ be an integer.

Let y = √(x) be the mth root of x.


Then we can write y = x^1/m which means the same thing as y = √(x).


Thus we can define the power to a positive rational number:

Let r =  p q ∈ℚ be a positive rational number where p ∈ℤ_≥ 0, q ∈ℤ_> 0.

Then x^r is defined as:
:x^r = x^p/q = ( √(x))^p = √(( x^p ) )


When r = -p q ∈ℚ: r < 0 we define:
:x^r = x^-p/q =  1 x^p/q
analogously for the negative integer definition.

=== Real Numbers ===
Let x ∈ℝ_>0 be a (strictly) positive real number.

Let r ∈ℝ be a real number.


We define x^r as:

:x^r := exp(   )r ln x
where exp denotes the exponential function.


This definition is an extension of the definition for rational r.

This follows from Logarithms of Powers and Exponential of Natural Logarithm: it can be seen that:
:∀ r ∈ℚ: exp(   )r ln x = exp(   )ln(   )x^r = x^r

 

=== Complex Numbers ===
Let z, k ∈ℂ be complex numbers.


z to the power of k is defined as the multifunction:

:z^k := e^k ln( z )

where:
:e^z is the exponential function
:ln is the  natural logarithm multifunction.


=== Principal Branch ===
The principal branch of a complex number raised to a complex power is defined as:

:z^k = e^k Ln z

where Ln z is the principal branch of the natural logarithm.


=== Positive Real Base ===
Let t > 0 be a real number and let k be a complex number.


The principal branch of a positive real number raised to a complex power is defined as:

:t^k = e^k ln t

where ln is the natural logarithm of a positive real number.

Then x^k is defined as:

:x^k := ∏_j  = 1^n x_j^k_j
where the powers on the   are integer powers.


Category:Definitions/Analysis

=== Power of Zero ===
Let r ∈ℝ be a real number.

(This includes the situation where r ∈ℤ or r ∈ℚ.)

When x=0, x^r is defined as follows:

:0^r =  1     : r = 0 
 0     : r > 0 
Undefined    : r < 0

This takes account of the awkward case 0^0: it is ""generally accepted"" that 0^0 = 1 as this convention agrees with certain general results which would otherwise need a special case.",Definition:Power (Algebra)

Then we can write the summation as:

:∑_R (   )j a_j =  The sum of all a_j such that R (   )j holds.


If more than one propositional function is written under the summation sign, they must all hold.


Such an operation on an ordered tuple is known as a summation.


Note that the definition by inequality form 1 ≤ j ≤ n is a special case of such a propositional function.

Also note that the definition by index form ∑_j  = 1^n is merely another way of writing ∑_1 ≤ j ≤ n.

Hence all instances of a summation can be expressed in terms of a propositional function.

Let ∑_R (   )j a_j be the summation over all a_j such that j satisfies R.


This can also be expressed:
:∑_j ∈ℤ a_j [ R (   )j ]
