300,Definition:Matrix Product,Product,"=== Matrix Product (Conventional) ===
Let ( R, +, ‚àò) be a ring.

Let ùêÄ = [ a ]_m n be an m √ó n matrix over R.

Let ùêÅ = [ b ]_n p be an n √ó p matrix over R.

Then the matrix product of ùêÄ and ùêÅ is written ùêÄùêÅ and is defined as follows.

Let ùêÄùêÅ = ùêÇ = [ c ]_m p.


Then:
:‚àÄ i ‚àà[ 1  . . ]m, j ‚àà[ 1  . . ]p: c_i j = ‚àë_k  = 1^n a_i k‚àò b_k j


Thus [ c ]_m p is the m √ó p matrix where each entry c_i j is built by forming the (ring) product of each entry in the i'th row of ùêÄ with the corresponding entry in the j'th column of ùêÅ and adding up all those products.


This operation is called matrix multiplication, and ùêÇ is the matrix product of ùêÄ with ùêÅ.


It follows that matrix multiplication is defined whenever the first matrix has the same number of columns as the second matrix has rows.


=== Pre-Multiplication ===
Let ( R, +, ‚àò) be a ring.

Let ùêÄ = [ a ]_m n be an m √ó n matrix over R.

Let ùêÅ = [ b ]_n p be an n √ó p matrix over R.


Let ùêÄùêÅ be the product of ùêÄ with ùêÅ.

Then ùêÅ is pre-multiplied by ùêÄ.

=== Post-Multiplication ===
Let ( R, +, ‚àò) be a ring.

Let ùêÄ = [ a ]_m n be an m √ó n matrix over R.

Let ùêÅ = [ b ]_n p be an n √ó p matrix over R.


Let ùêÄùêÅ be the product of ùêÄ with ùêÅ.

Then ùêÄ is post-multiplied by ùêÅ.

=== Using Einstein Summation Convention ===
Let ( R, +, ‚àò) be a ring.

Let ùêÄ = [ a ]_m n be an m √ó n matrix over R.

Let ùêÅ = [ b ]_n p be an n √ó p matrix over R.


The matrix product of ùêÄ and ùêÅ can be expressed using the Einstein summation convention as:

Then:
:c_i j := a_i k‚àò b_k j


The index which appears twice in the expressions on the   is the entry k, which is the one summated over.

=== Conformable Matrices ===
Let ùêÄ and ùêÅ be matrices.

It needs to be emphasised that matrix product can be defined on ùêÄ and ùêÅ  if and only if  ùêÄ and ùêÅ are conformable.


That is, if the number of rows of one is equal to the number of columns of the other.

=== Matrix Scalar Product ===
Let ùîΩ denote one of the standard number systems.

Let ‚Ñ≥(   )m, n be the m √ó n matrix space over ùîΩ.

Let ùêÄ = [ a ]_m n‚àà‚Ñ≥(   )m, n.

Let Œª‚ààùîΩ be any element of F.


The operation of scalar multiplication of ùêÄ by Œª is defined as follows.

Let ŒªùêÄ = ùêÇ.

Then:
:‚àÄ i ‚àà[ 1  . . ]m, j ‚àà[ 1  . . ]n: c_i j = Œª a_i j

ŒªùêÄ is the scalar product of Œª and ùêÄ.


Thus ùêÇ = [ c ]_m n is the m √ó n matrix composed of the product of Œª with the corresponding elements of ùêÄ.


=== Ring ===
Let ( R, +, ‚àò) be a ring.

Let ùêÄ = [ a ]_m n be an m √ó n matrix over ( R, +, ‚àò).

Let Œª‚àà R be any element of R.


The scalar product of Œª and ùêÄ is defined as follows.

Let Œª‚àòùêÄ = ùêÇ.

Then:
:‚àÄ i ‚àà[ 1  . . ]m, j ‚àà[ 1  . . ]n: c_i j = Œª‚àò a_i j


Thus [ c ]_m n is the m √ó n matrix composed of the product of Œª with the corresponding elements of ùêÄ.


=== Scalar ===

=== Kronecker Product ===

Also known as matrix direct product:

Let ùêÄ = [ a ]_m n and ùêÅ = [ b ]_p q be matrices.

The Kronecker product of ùêÄ and ùêÅ is denoted ùêÄ‚äóùêÅ and is defined as the block matrix:

:ùêÄ‚äóùêÅ = [ a_11ùêÅ a_12ùêÅ     ‚ãØ a_1nùêÅ; a_21ùêÅ a_22ùêÅ     ‚ãØ a_2nùêÅ;     ‚ãÆ     ‚ãÆ     ‚ã±     ‚ãÆ; a_m1ùêÅ a_m2ùêÅ     ‚ãØ a_mnùêÅ ]


Writing this out in full:

:ùêÄ‚äóùêÅ = [ a_11 b_11 a_11 b_12         ‚ãØ a_11 b_1q         ‚ãØ         ‚ãØ a_1n b_11 a_1n b_12         ‚ãØ a_1n b_1q; a_11 b_21 a_11 b_22         ‚ãØ a_11 b_2q         ‚ãØ         ‚ãØ a_1n b_21 a_1n b_22         ‚ãØ a_1n b_2q;         ‚ãÆ         ‚ãÆ         ‚ã±         ‚ãÆ                             ‚ãÆ         ‚ãÆ         ‚ã±         ‚ãÆ; a_11 b_p1 a_11 b_p2         ‚ãØ a_11 b_pq         ‚ãØ         ‚ãØ a_1n b_p1 a_1n b_p2         ‚ãØ a_1n b_pq;         ‚ãÆ         ‚ãÆ                   ‚ãÆ         ‚ã±                   ‚ãÆ         ‚ãÆ                   ‚ãÆ;         ‚ãÆ         ‚ãÆ                   ‚ãÆ                   ‚ã±         ‚ãÆ         ‚ãÆ                   ‚ãÆ; a_m1 b_11 a_m1 b_12         ‚ãØ a_m1 b_1q         ‚ãØ         ‚ãØ a_mn b_11 a_mn b_12         ‚ãØ a_mn b_1q; a_m1 b_21 a_m1 b_22         ‚ãØ a_m1 b_2q         ‚ãØ         ‚ãØ a_mn b_21 a_mn b_22         ‚ãØ a_mn b_2q;         ‚ãÆ         ‚ãÆ         ‚ã±         ‚ãÆ                             ‚ãÆ         ‚ãÆ         ‚ã±         ‚ãÆ; a_m1 b_p1 a_m1 b_p2         ‚ãØ a_m1 b_pq         ‚ãØ         ‚ãØ a_mn b_p1 a_mn b_p2         ‚ãØ a_mn b_pq ]


Thus, if:
:ùêÄ is a matrix with order m √ó n
:ùêÅ is a matrix with order p √ó q

then ùêÄ‚äóùêÅ is a matrix with order m p √ó n q.

=== Hadamard Product ===

Also known as Matrix Entrywise Product or Schur Product:

The Hadamard product of ùêÄ and ùêÅ is written ùêÄ‚àòùêÅ and is defined as follows:

:ùêÄ‚àòùêÅ := ùêÇ = [ c ]_m n

A proof system ùí´ for ‚Ñí comprises:

* Axioms and/or axiom schemata;
* Rules of inference for deriving theorems.


It is usual that a proof system does this by declaring certain arguments concerning ‚Ñí to be valid.

Informally, a proof system amounts to a precise account of what constitutes a (formal) proof.


=== Rule of Inference ===
Let ‚Ñí be a formal language.

Part of defining a proof system ùí´ for ‚Ñí is to specify its rules of inference.


A rule of inference is a specification of a valid means to conclude new theorems in ùí´ from given theorems and axioms of ùí´.

Often, the formulation of rules of inference also appeals to the notion of provable consequence to be able to deal with assumptions as part of a proof.

Part of defining a proof system ùí´ for ‚Ñí is to specify its axiom schemata.


An axiom schema is a well-formed formula œï of ‚Ñí, except for it containing one or more variables which are outside ‚Ñí itself.

This formula can then be used to represent an infinite number of individual axioms in one statement.


Namely, each of these variables is allowed to take a specified range of values, most commonly WFFs.

Each WFF œà that results from œï by a valid choice of values for all the variables is then an axiom of ùí´.

=== Formal Proof ===
Let ùí´ be a proof system for a formal language ‚Ñí.


Let œï be a WFF of ‚Ñí.

A formal proof of œï in ùí´ is a collection of axioms and rules of inference of ùí´ that leads to the conclusion that œï is a theorem of ùí´.

The dyne is the CGS unit of force.

It is defined as being:

:The amount of force required to accelerate a mass of one gram at a rate of one centimetre per second squared.


This arises from Newton's Second Law of Motion, which states that such an acceleration exists under the influence of such a force.


=== Conversion Factors ===


=== Symbol ===
 

=== Base Units ===
The CGS base units of the dyne are:

:dyn := g cm s^-2
where:
:g denotes grams
:cm denotes centimetres
:s denotes seconds (of time).

==== Erg ====
The erg is the CGS unit of energy:


It is defined as being:

:the energy transferred to (or work done on) a body when a force of 1 dyne acts on that body in the direction of the force's motion through a distance of 1 centimetre.

Thus:
:1  erg = 1  dyn cm

=== Base Units ===
The CGS base units of the erg are:

:cm denotes centimetres
:s denotes seconds (of time).

Let ‚ü® x_i ‚ü©_i ‚àà I denote the set of the images of all the element i ‚àà I under x.


The image of x at an index i is referred to as a term of the (indexed) family, and is denoted x_i.


=== Notation ===
The family of elements x of S indexed by I is often seen with one of the following notations:

:‚ü® x_i ‚ü©_i ‚àà I

:( x_i )_i ‚àà I

:{ x_i }_i ‚àà I


There is little consistency in the literature, but ( x_i )_i ‚àà I is perhaps most common.

The preferred notation on   is ‚ü® x_i ‚ü©_i ‚àà I.

The subscripted i ‚àà I is often left out, if it is obvious in the particular context.


Note the use of x_i to denote the image of the index i under the indexing function x.

As x is actually a mapping, one would expect the conventional notation x (   )i.

However, this is generally not used, and x_i is used instead.
