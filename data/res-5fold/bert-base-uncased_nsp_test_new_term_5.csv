16,Definition:Formal Language/Alphabet,Alphabet,"Let ℒ be a formal language.


The alphabet 𝒜 of ℒ is a set of symbols from which collations in ℒ may be constructed.

An alphabet consists of the following parts:

:The letters
:The signs.


Depending on the specific nature of any particular formal language, these too may be subcategorized.


=== Letter ===
A letter of a formal language is a more or less arbitrary symbol whose interpretation depends on the specific context.

In building a formal language, letters are considered to be the undefined terms of said language.


An important part of assigning semantics to a formal language is to provide an interpretation for its letters.


=== Vocabulary ===
The vocabulary of a formal language is the collection of all of its letters.

As such, it forms part of the alphabet of this language.


Each signature for the language may have a different vocabulary.

However, different signatures only have different members of the respective classes of symbols comprising the alphabet, rather than introducing new such classes.

=== Sign ===
A sign of a formal language ℒ is a symbol whose primary purpose is to structure ℒ.

In building a formal language, signs form the hooks allowing the formal grammar to define the well-formed formulae of the formal language.


Common examples of signs are parentheses, ""("" and "")"", and the comma, "","".

The logical connectives are also signs.


Signs form part of the alphabet of ℒ.

Unlike the letters, they must be the same for each signature for ℒ.

=== Primitive Symbol ===
Let 𝒜 be the alphabet of a formal language ℒ.

The symbols which comprise 𝒜 are called the primitive symbols of 𝒜.

18,Definition:Argument of Complex Number,Argument,"Let z = x + i y be a complex number.

An argument of z, or z, is formally defined as a solution to the pair of equations:
:(1):    x | z | = cos(   ) z
:(2):    y | z | = sin(   ) z
where | z | is the modulus of z.

From Sine and Cosine are Periodic on Reals, it follows that if θ is an argument of z, then so is θ + 2 k π where k ∈ℤ is any integer.


Thus, the argument of a complex number z is a continuous multifunction.

 


=== Principal Range ===
It is understood that the argument of a complex number z is unique only up to multiples of 2 k π.

With this understanding, we can limit the choice of what θ can be for any given z by requiring that θ lie in some half open interval of length 2 π.

The most usual of these are:
:[ 0  . . )2 π
:( -π . . ]π

but in theory any such interval may be used.

This interval is known as the principal range.

=== Principal Argument ===
Let R be the principal range of the complex numbers ℂ.

The unique value of θ in R is known as the principal argument, of z.

This is denoted Arg( z ).

Note the capital A.

The standard practice is for R to be ( -π . . ]π.

This ensures that the principal argument is continuous on the real axis for positive numbers.

Thus, if z is represented in the complex plane, the principal argument Arg( z ) is intuitively defined as the angle which z yields with the real (y = 0) axis.


 ",Definition:Argument of Complex Number
19,Definition:Logical Argument,Argument,"A logical argument (or just argument) is a process of creating a new statement from one or more existing statements.

An argument proceeds from a set of premises to a conclusion, by means of logical implication, via a procedure called logical inference.


An argument may have more than one premise, but only one conclusion.


While statements may be classified as either true or false, an argument may be classified as either valid or invalid.


Loosely speaking, a valid argument is one that leads unshakeably from true statements to other true statements, whereas an invalid argument is one that can lead you to, for example, a false statement from one which is true.


Thus:
:An argument may be valid, even though its premises are false.
:An argument may be invalid, even though its premises are true.
:An argument may be invalid and its premises false.

It is even possible for the conclusion of an argument to be true, even though the argument is invalid and its premises are false.


To be sure of the truth of a conclusion, it is necessary to make sure both that the premises are true and that the argument is valid.


However, while you may not actually know whether a statement is true or not, you can investigate the consequences of it being either true or false, and see what effect that has on the truth value of the proposition(s) of which it is a part. That, in short, is what the process of logical argument consists of.


An argument may be described symbolically by means of sequents, which specify the flow of an argument.


=== Finitary Argument ===
A finitary argument is a logical argument which starts with a finite number of axioms, and can be translated into a finite number of statements.",Definition:Logical Argument

:∀ p: ( p ∈ S × T ∃ x: ∃ y: x ∈ S  y ∈ T  p = ( x, y )  )


S × T can be voiced S cross T.


=== Class Theory ===
Let A and B be classes.


The cartesian product A × B of A and B is the class of ordered pairs ( x, y ) with x ∈ A and y ∈ B:

:A × B = {( x, y ): x ∈ A  y ∈ B }


Thus:
:∀ p: ( p ∈ A × B ∃ x: ∃ y: x ∈ A  y ∈ B  p = ( x, y )  )


A × B can be voiced A cross B.

=== Finite Cartesian Product ===
Let ⟨ S_n ⟩ be a sequence of sets. 

The (finite) cartesian product of ⟨ S_n ⟩ is defined as:

:∏_k  = 1^n S_k = {( x_1, x_2, …, x_n ): ∀ k ∈ℕ^*_n: x_k ∈ S_k }


It is also denoted S_1 × S_2 ×⋯× S_n.

Thus S_1 × S_2 ×⋯× S_n is the set of all ordered n-tuples ( x_1, x_2, …, x_n ) with x_k ∈ S_k.


In particular:
:∏_k  = 1^2 S_k = S_1 × S_2

=== Countable Cartesian Product ===

The same notation can be used to define the (countable) cartesian product of an infinite sequence:

Let ⟨ S_n ⟩_n ∈ℕ be an infinite sequence of sets. 

The cartesian product of ⟨ S_n ⟩ is defined as:

:∏_k  = 1^∞ S_k = {( x_1, x_2, …, x_n, …): ∀ k ∈ℕ: x_k ∈ S_k }


It defines the concept:
:S_1 × S_2 ×⋯× S_n ×⋯

Thus ∏_k  = 1^∞ S_k is the set of all infinite sequences ( x_1, x_2, …, x_n, …) with x_k ∈ S_k.

=== Family of Sets ===
Let I be an indexing set.

Let ⟨ S_i ⟩_i ∈ I be a family of sets indexed by I.

The cartesian product of ⟨ S_i ⟩_i ∈ I is the set of all families ⟨ s_i ⟩_i ∈ I with s_i ∈ S_i for each i ∈ I.


This can be denoted ∏_i ∈ I S_i or, if I is understood, ∏_i S_i.",Definition:Cartesian Product

Let ( R, +, ∘) be a ring.

Let 𝐀 = [ a ]_m n be an m × n matrix over R.

Let 𝐁 = [ b ]_n p be an n × p matrix over R.

Then the matrix product of 𝐀 and 𝐁 is written 𝐀𝐁 and is defined as follows.

Let 𝐀𝐁 = 𝐂 = [ c ]_m p.


Then:
:∀ i ∈[ 1  . . ]m, j ∈[ 1  . . ]p: c_i j = ∑_k  = 1^n a_i k∘ b_k j


Thus [ c ]_m p is the m × p matrix where each entry c_i j is built by forming the (ring) product of each entry in the i'th row of 𝐀 with the corresponding entry in the j'th column of 𝐁 and adding up all those products.


This operation is called matrix multiplication, and 𝐂 is the matrix product of 𝐀 with 𝐁.


It follows that matrix multiplication is defined whenever the first matrix has the same number of columns as the second matrix has rows.


=== Pre-Multiplication ===
Let ( R, +, ∘) be a ring.

Let 𝐀 = [ a ]_m n be an m × n matrix over R.

Let 𝐁 = [ b ]_n p be an n × p matrix over R.


Let 𝐀𝐁 be the product of 𝐀 with 𝐁.

Then 𝐁 is pre-multiplied by 𝐀.

=== Post-Multiplication ===
Let ( R, +, ∘) be a ring.

Let 𝐀 = [ a ]_m n be an m × n matrix over R.

Let 𝐁 = [ b ]_n p be an n × p matrix over R.


Let 𝐀𝐁 be the product of 𝐀 with 𝐁.

Then 𝐀 is post-multiplied by 𝐁.

=== Using Einstein Summation Convention ===
Let ( R, +, ∘) be a ring.

Let 𝐀 = [ a ]_m n be an m × n matrix over R.

Let 𝐁 = [ b ]_n p be an n × p matrix over R.


The matrix product of 𝐀 and 𝐁 can be expressed using the Einstein summation convention as:

Then:
:c_i j := a_i k∘ b_k j


The index which appears twice in the expressions on the   is the entry k, which is the one summated over.

=== Conformable Matrices ===
Let 𝐀 and 𝐁 be matrices.

It needs to be emphasised that matrix product can be defined on 𝐀 and 𝐁  if and only if  𝐀 and 𝐁 are conformable.


That is, if the number of rows of one is equal to the number of columns of the other.

=== Matrix Scalar Product ===
Let 𝔽 denote one of the standard number systems.

Let ℳ(   )m, n be the m × n matrix space over 𝔽.

Let 𝐀 = [ a ]_m n∈ℳ(   )m, n.

Let λ∈𝔽 be any element of F.


The operation of scalar multiplication of 𝐀 by λ is defined as follows.

Let λ𝐀 = 𝐂.

Then:
:∀ i ∈[ 1  . . ]m, j ∈[ 1  . . ]n: c_i j = λ a_i j

λ𝐀 is the scalar product of λ and 𝐀.


Thus 𝐂 = [ c ]_m n is the m × n matrix composed of the product of λ with the corresponding elements of 𝐀.


=== Ring ===
Let ( R, +, ∘) be a ring.

Let 𝐀 = [ a ]_m n be an m × n matrix over ( R, +, ∘).

Let λ∈ R be any element of R.


The scalar product of λ and 𝐀 is defined as follows.

Let λ∘𝐀 = 𝐂.

Then:
:∀ i ∈[ 1  . . ]m, j ∈[ 1  . . ]n: c_i j = λ∘ a_i j


Thus [ c ]_m n is the m × n matrix composed of the product of λ with the corresponding elements of 𝐀.


=== Scalar ===
Let ℳ(   )m, n be a matrix space of order m × n on which scalar multiplication is defined.

Let 𝐀 = [ a ]_m n∈ℳ(   )m, n.

:𝐀⊗𝐁 = [ a_11𝐁 a_12𝐁     ⋯ a_1n𝐁; a_21𝐁 a_22𝐁     ⋯ a_2n𝐁;     ⋮     ⋮     ⋱     ⋮; a_m1𝐁 a_m2𝐁     ⋯ a_mn𝐁 ]


Writing this out in full:

:𝐀⊗𝐁 = [ a_11 b_11 a_11 b_12         ⋯ a_11 b_1q         ⋯         ⋯ a_1n b_11 a_1n b_12         ⋯ a_1n b_1q; a_11 b_21 a_11 b_22         ⋯ a_11 b_2q         ⋯         ⋯ a_1n b_21 a_1n b_22         ⋯ a_1n b_2q;         ⋮         ⋮         ⋱         ⋮                             ⋮         ⋮         ⋱         ⋮; a_11 b_p1 a_11 b_p2         ⋯ a_11 b_pq         ⋯         ⋯ a_1n b_p1 a_1n b_p2         ⋯ a_1n b_pq;         ⋮         ⋮                   ⋮         ⋱                   ⋮         ⋮                   ⋮;         ⋮         ⋮                   ⋮                   ⋱         ⋮         ⋮                   ⋮; a_m1 b_11 a_m1 b_12         ⋯ a_m1 b_1q         ⋯         ⋯ a_mn b_11 a_mn b_12         ⋯ a_mn b_1q; a_m1 b_21 a_m1 b_22         ⋯ a_m1 b_2q         ⋯         ⋯ a_mn b_21 a_mn b_22         ⋯ a_mn b_2q;         ⋮         ⋮         ⋱         ⋮                             ⋮         ⋮         ⋱         ⋮; a_m1 b_p1 a_m1 b_p2         ⋯ a_m1 b_pq         ⋯         ⋯ a_mn b_p1 a_mn b_p2         ⋯ a_mn b_pq ]


Thus, if:
:𝐀 is a matrix with order m × n
:𝐁 is a matrix with order p × q

then 𝐀⊗𝐁 is a matrix with order m p × n q.

Also known as Matrix Entrywise Product or Schur Product:

Let 𝐀 = [ a ]_m n and 𝐁 = [ b ]_m n be m × n matrices over a ring ( R, +, ×).

Construct an infinite straight line through O and P and call it the x-axis.


Identify the x-axis with the real number line such that:

:1 is identified with the point P'


The orientation of the y-axis is determined by the position of P' relative to O.

It is conventional to locate P' such that, if one were to imagine being positioned at O and facing along the x-axis towards P, then P' is on the left.
