As Disjoint Permutations Commute, the order in which they are performed does not matter.


So, for a given permutation ρ, the cycle notation for ρ consists of all the disjoint cycles into which ρ can be decomposed, concatenated as a product.

It is conventional to omit 1-cycles from the expression, and to write those cycles with lowest starting number first.

:[ s  d_1 d_2 d_3 …]_10
where:
:s = ⌊ x ⌋, the floor of x
:it is not the case that there exists m ∈ℕ such that d_M = 9 for all M ≥ m.
(That is, the sequence of digits does not end with an infinite sequence of 9s.)


=== Decimal Point ===
Let x ∈ℝ have a decimal expansion:
:n. d_1 d_2 d_3 …


The dot that separates the integer part from the fractional part of x is called the decimal point.

That is, it is the radix point when used specifically for a base 10 representation.

Let x ∈ℝ be a real number such that x ≥ 0.

Let b ∈ℕ: b ≥ 2.


Let us define the recursive sequence:
:∀ n ∈ℕ: n ≥ 1: ⟨ f_n ⟩ = 
b ( x - ⌊ x ⌋)     : n = 1 

b ( f_n - 1 - ⌊ f_n - 1⌋)     : n > 1

Then we define:
:∀ n ∈ℕ: n ≥ 1: ⟨ d_n ⟩ = ⌊ f_n ⌋


It follows from the method of construction and the definition of the floor function that:

:∀ n: 0 ≤ f_n < b and hence ∀ n: 0 ≤ d_n ≤ b - 1
:∀ n: f_n = 0  f_n + 1 = 0 and hence d_n + 1 = 0.


Hence we can express x = ⌊ x ⌋ + ∑_j ≥ 1d_j/b^j as:

:s = ⌊ x ⌋
:it is not the case that there exists m ∈ℕ such that d_M = b - 1 for all M ≥ m.

A space rotation r_θ can be expressed as an axial vector 𝐫_θ such that:
:the direction of 𝐫_θ is defined to be its axis of rotation
:the length of 𝐫_θ specifies its angle of rotation of 𝐫_θ to an appropriate scale.

Let 𝐕 be an axial vector acting with respect to an axis of rotation R.

Consider a right hand with its fingers curled round R so that the fingers are pointed in the direction of rotation of 𝐕 around R.


The right-hand rule is the convention that the direction of 𝐕 is the direction in which the thumb is pointing:

Often, the formulation of rules of inference also appeals to the notion of provable consequence to be able to deal with assumptions as part of a proof.

=== Axiom ===
Let ℒ be a formal language.

Part of defining a proof system 𝒫 for ℒ is to specify its axioms.


An axiom of 𝒫 is a well-formed formula of ℒ that 𝒫 approves of by definition.


=== Axiom Schema ===
Let ℒ be a formal language.

Part of defining a proof system 𝒫 for ℒ is to specify its axiom schemata.


An axiom schema is a well-formed formula ϕ of ℒ, except for it containing one or more variables which are outside ℒ itself.

This formula can then be used to represent an infinite number of individual axioms in one statement.


Namely, each of these variables is allowed to take a specified range of values, most commonly WFFs.

Each WFF ψ that results from ϕ by a valid choice of values for all the variables is then an axiom of 𝒫.

=== Formal Proof ===
Let 𝒫 be a proof system for a formal language ℒ.


Let ϕ be a WFF of ℒ.

A formal proof of ϕ in 𝒫 is a collection of axioms and rules of inference of 𝒫 that leads to the conclusion that ϕ is a theorem of 𝒫.


The term formal proof is also used to refer to specific presentations of such collections.

For example, the term applies to tableau proofs in natural deduction.",Definition:Proof System

Let F: C → D and H: D → D be holomorphic functions.

Let H (   )F (   )z = F (   )z + 1 for all z ∈ C.

Then F is said to be a superfunction of H, and H is called a transfer function of F.

That is, superfunctions are iterations of transfer functions.",Definition:Superfunction

437,Definition:Graph (Graph Theory)/Vertex,Vertex," 

Let G = ( V, E ) be a graph.

The vertices (singular: vertex) are the elements of V.

Informally, the vertices are the points that are connected by the edges.


In the above, the vertices are the points A, B, C, D, E, F, G which are marked as dots.",Definition:Graph (Graph Theory)/Vertex
