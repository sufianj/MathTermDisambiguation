Let ( R, +, ‚àò) be a ring.

Let ùêÄ = [ a ]_m n be an m √ó n matrix over R.

Let ùêÅ = [ b ]_n p be an n √ó p matrix over R.

Then the matrix product of ùêÄ and ùêÅ is written ùêÄùêÅ and is defined as follows.

Let ùêÄùêÅ = ùêÇ = [ c ]_m p.


Then:
:‚àÄ i ‚àà[ 1  . . ]m, j ‚àà[ 1  . . ]p: c_i j = ‚àë_k  = 1^n a_i k‚àò b_k j


Thus [ c ]_m p is the m √ó p matrix where each entry c_i j is built by forming the (ring) product of each entry in the i'th row of ùêÄ with the corresponding entry in the j'th column of ùêÅ and adding up all those products.


This operation is called matrix multiplication, and ùêÇ is the matrix product of ùêÄ with ùêÅ.


It follows that matrix multiplication is defined whenever the first matrix has the same number of columns as the second matrix has rows.


=== Pre-Multiplication ===
Let ( R, +, ‚àò) be a ring.

Let ùêÄ = [ a ]_m n be an m √ó n matrix over R.

Let ùêÅ = [ b ]_n p be an n √ó p matrix over R.


Let ùêÄùêÅ be the product of ùêÄ with ùêÅ.

Then ùêÅ is pre-multiplied by ùêÄ.

=== Post-Multiplication ===
Let ( R, +, ‚àò) be a ring.

Let ùêÄ = [ a ]_m n be an m √ó n matrix over R.

Let ùêÅ = [ b ]_n p be an n √ó p matrix over R.


Let ùêÄùêÅ be the product of ùêÄ with ùêÅ.

Then ùêÄ is post-multiplied by ùêÅ.

=== Using Einstein Summation Convention ===
Let ( R, +, ‚àò) be a ring.

Let ùêÄ = [ a ]_m n be an m √ó n matrix over R.

Let ùêÅ = [ b ]_n p be an n √ó p matrix over R.


The matrix product of ùêÄ and ùêÅ can be expressed using the Einstein summation convention as:

Then:
:c_i j := a_i k‚àò b_k j


The index which appears twice in the expressions on the   is the entry k, which is the one summated over.

=== Conformable Matrices ===
Let ùêÄ and ùêÅ be matrices.

It needs to be emphasised that matrix product can be defined on ùêÄ and ùêÅ  if and only if  ùêÄ and ùêÅ are conformable.


That is, if the number of rows of one is equal to the number of columns of the other.

=== Matrix Scalar Product ===
Let ùîΩ denote one of the standard number systems.

Let ‚Ñ≥(   )m, n be the m √ó n matrix space over ùîΩ.

Let ùêÄ = [ a ]_m n‚àà‚Ñ≥(   )m, n.

Let Œª‚ààùîΩ be any element of F.


The operation of scalar multiplication of ùêÄ by Œª is defined as follows.

Let ŒªùêÄ = ùêÇ.

Then:
:‚àÄ i ‚àà[ 1  . . ]m, j ‚àà[ 1  . . ]n: c_i j = Œª a_i j

ŒªùêÄ is the scalar product of Œª and ùêÄ.


Thus ùêÇ = [ c ]_m n is the m √ó n matrix composed of the product of Œª with the corresponding elements of ùêÄ.


=== Ring ===
Let ( R, +, ‚àò) be a ring.

Let ùêÄ = [ a ]_m n be an m √ó n matrix over ( R, +, ‚àò).

Let Œª‚àà R be any element of R.


The scalar product of Œª and ùêÄ is defined as follows.

Let Œª‚àòùêÄ = ùêÇ.

Then:
:‚àÄ i ‚àà[ 1  . . ]m, j ‚àà[ 1  . . ]n: c_i j = Œª‚àò a_i j


Thus [ c ]_m n is the m √ó n matrix composed of the product of Œª with the corresponding elements of ùêÄ.


=== Scalar ===

Let ùêÄ = [ a ]_m n‚àà‚Ñ≥(   )m, n.

Also known as matrix direct product:

Thus, if:

:ùêÅ is a matrix with order p √ó q

then ùêÄ‚äóùêÅ is a matrix with order m p √ó n q.

Let x: I ‚Üí S be a mapping.

Let x_i denote the image of an element i ‚àà I of the domain I of x.

Let ‚ü® x_i ‚ü©_i ‚àà I denote the set of the images of all the element i ‚àà I under x.


The image of x at an index i is referred to as a term of the (indexed) family, and is denoted x_i.


=== Notation ===
The family of elements x of S indexed by I is often seen with one of the following notations:

:‚ü® x_i ‚ü©_i ‚àà I

:( x_i )_i ‚àà I

:{ x_i }_i ‚àà I


There is little consistency in the literature, but ( x_i )_i ‚àà I is perhaps most common.

The preferred notation on   is ‚ü® x_i ‚ü©_i ‚àà I.

The subscripted i ‚àà I is often left out, if it is obvious in the particular context.


Note the use of x_i to denote the image of the index i under the indexing function x.

As x is actually a mapping, one would expect the conventional notation x (   )i.

However, this is generally not used, and x_i is used instead.
