Then we can write:

:∏_R (   )j a_j =  the product of all a_j such that R (   )j holds.


If more than one propositional function is written under the product sign, they must all hold.


Such an operation on an ordered tuple is known as a continued product.


Note that the definition by inequality form 1 ≤ j ≤ n is a special case of such a propositional function.

Thus S_1 × S_2 ×⋯× S_n is the set of all ordered n-tuples ( x_1, x_2, …, x_n ) with x_k ∈ S_k.


In particular:
:∏_k  = 1^2 S_k = S_1 × S_2

The cartesian product of ⟨ S_n ⟩ is defined as:

:∏_k  = 1^∞ S_k = {( x_1, x_2, …, x_n, …): ∀ k ∈ℕ: x_k ∈ S_k }


It defines the concept:

Let 𝐁 = [ b ]_n p be an n × p matrix over R.

Then the matrix product of 𝐀 and 𝐁 is written 𝐀𝐁 and is defined as follows.

Let 𝐀𝐁 = 𝐂 = [ c ]_m p.


Then:
:∀ i ∈[ 1  . . ]m, j ∈[ 1  . . ]p: c_i j = ∑_k  = 1^n a_i k∘ b_k j


Thus [ c ]_m p is the m × p matrix where each entry c_i j is built by forming the (ring) product of each entry in the i'th row of 𝐀 with the corresponding entry in the j'th column of 𝐁 and adding up all those products.


This operation is called matrix multiplication, and 𝐂 is the matrix product of 𝐀 with 𝐁.


It follows that matrix multiplication is defined whenever the first matrix has the same number of columns as the second matrix has rows.


=== Pre-Multiplication ===
Let ( R, +, ∘) be a ring.

Let 𝐀 = [ a ]_m n be an m × n matrix over R.

Let 𝐀 = [ a ]_m n be an m × n matrix over R.

Let 𝐁 = [ b ]_n p be an n × p matrix over R.


The matrix product of 𝐀 and 𝐁 can be expressed using the Einstein summation convention as:

The index which appears twice in the expressions on the   is the entry k, which is the one summated over.

=== Conformable Matrices ===

Let λ𝐀 = 𝐂.

Then:
:∀ i ∈[ 1  . . ]m, j ∈[ 1  . . ]n: c_i j = λ a_i j

λ𝐀 is the scalar product of λ and 𝐀.


Thus 𝐂 = [ c ]_m n is the m × n matrix composed of the product of λ with the corresponding elements of 𝐀.


=== Ring ===
Let ( R, +, ∘) be a ring.

Let 𝐀 = [ a ]_m n be an m × n matrix over ( R, +, ∘).

=== Hadamard Product ===

Also known as Matrix Entrywise Product or Schur Product:

Let 𝐀 = [ a ]_m n and 𝐁 = [ b ]_m n be m × n matrices over a ring ( R, +, ×).


The Hadamard product of 𝐀 and 𝐁 is written 𝐀∘𝐁 and is defined as follows:

:𝐀∘𝐁 := 𝐂 = [ c ]_m n

where:

:∀ i ∈[ 1  . . ]m, j ∈[ 1  . . ]n: c_i j = a_i j× b_i j

Let 𝐂 be a metacategory.

Let A and B be objects of 𝐂.


A (binary) product diagram for A and B comprises an object P and morphisms p_1: P → A, p_2: P → B:

::@+1em@L+3px
 A
   
 P
  [l]_*+p_1[r]^*+p_2   
 B

subjected to the following universal mapping property:


:For any object X and morphisms x_1, x_2 like so:

::@+1em@L+3px
 A
   
 X
  [l]_*+x_1[r]^*+x_2

:is a commutative diagram, i.e., x_1 = p_1 ∘ u and x_2 = p_2 ∘ u.


In this situation, P is called a (binary) product of A and B and may be denoted A × B.

Generally, one writes ⟨x_1, x_2⟩ for the unique morphism u determined by above diagram.


The morphisms p_1 and p_2 are often taken to be implicit.

They are called projections; if necessary, p_1 can be called the first projection and p_2 the second projection.
 

=== General Definition ===
Let 𝐂 be a metacategory.

Let 𝒞 be any collection of objects of 𝐂.

Let 𝐃𝐢𝐬(   )𝒞 be the discrete category on 𝒞, considered as a subcategory of 𝐂.


A product for 𝒞, denoted ∏𝒞, is a limit for the inclusion functor D: 𝐃𝐢𝐬(   )𝒞→𝐂, considered as a diagram.


For an object C in 𝒞, the associated morphism ∏𝒞→ C is denoted pr_C and called the projection on C.

The whole construction is pictured in the following commutative diagram:

::@R-.5em@L+3px

309,Definition:Complementary Angles,Complement,":

Let ∠ BAC be a right angle.

Let ∠ BAD + ∠ DAC = ∠ BAC.

That is:
:∠ DAC = ∠ BAC - ∠ BAD


Then ∠ DAC is the complement of ∠ BAD.


Hence, for any angle α (whether less than a right angle or not), the complement of α is π 2 - α.

Measured in degrees, the complement of α is 90^∘ - α.


If α is the complement of β, then it follows that β is the complement of α.

Hence we can say that α and β are complementary.


It can be seen from this that the complement of an angle greater than a right angle is negative.


Thus complementary angles are two angles whose measures add up to the measure of a right angle.
