More specifically:
:‚àÄ p: ( p ‚àà S √ó T ‚àÉ x: ‚àÉ y: x ‚àà S  y ‚àà T  p = ( x, y )  )


S √ó T can be voiced S cross T.


=== Class Theory ===
Let A and B be classes.


The cartesian product A √ó B of A and B is the class of ordered pairs ( x, y ) with x ‚àà A and y ‚àà B:

:A √ó B = {( x, y ): x ‚àà A  y ‚àà B }


Thus:
:‚àÄ p: ( p ‚àà A √ó B ‚àÉ x: ‚àÉ y: x ‚àà A  y ‚àà B  p = ( x, y )  )


A √ó B can be voiced A cross B.

=== Finite Cartesian Product ===
Let ‚ü® S_n ‚ü© be a sequence of sets. 

The (finite) cartesian product of ‚ü® S_n ‚ü© is defined as:

:‚àè_k  = 1^n S_k = {( x_1, x_2, ‚Ä¶, x_n ): ‚àÄ k ‚àà‚Ñï^*_n: x_k ‚àà S_k }


It is also denoted S_1 √ó S_2 √ó‚ãØ√ó S_n.

Thus S_1 √ó S_2 √ó‚ãØ√ó S_n is the set of all ordered n-tuples ( x_1, x_2, ‚Ä¶, x_n ) with x_k ‚àà S_k.


In particular:
:‚àè_k  = 1^2 S_k = S_1 √ó S_2

=== Countable Cartesian Product ===

The same notation can be used to define the (countable) cartesian product of an infinite sequence:

Let ‚ü® S_n ‚ü©_n ‚àà‚Ñï be an infinite sequence of sets. 

The cartesian product of ‚ü® S_n ‚ü© is defined as:

:‚àè_k  = 1^‚àû S_k = {( x_1, x_2, ‚Ä¶, x_n, ‚Ä¶): ‚àÄ k ‚àà‚Ñï: x_k ‚àà S_k }


It defines the concept:
:S_1 √ó S_2 √ó‚ãØ√ó S_n √ó‚ãØ

Thus ‚àè_k  = 1^‚àû S_k is the set of all infinite sequences ( x_1, x_2, ‚Ä¶, x_n, ‚Ä¶) with x_k ‚àà S_k.

=== Family of Sets ===
Let I be an indexing set.

Let ( R, +, ‚àò) be a ring.

Let ùêÄ = [ a ]_m n be an m √ó n matrix over R.

Let ùêÅ = [ b ]_n p be an n √ó p matrix over R.

Then the matrix product of ùêÄ and ùêÅ is written ùêÄùêÅ and is defined as follows.

Let ùêÄùêÅ = ùêÇ = [ c ]_m p.


Then:
:‚àÄ i ‚àà[ 1  . . ]m, j ‚àà[ 1  . . ]p: c_i j = ‚àë_k  = 1^n a_i k‚àò b_k j


Thus [ c ]_m p is the m √ó p matrix where each entry c_i j is built by forming the (ring) product of each entry in the i'th row of ùêÄ with the corresponding entry in the j'th column of ùêÅ and adding up all those products.


This operation is called matrix multiplication, and ùêÇ is the matrix product of ùêÄ with ùêÅ.


It follows that matrix multiplication is defined whenever the first matrix has the same number of columns as the second matrix has rows.


=== Pre-Multiplication ===
Let ( R, +, ‚àò) be a ring.

Let ùêÄ = [ a ]_m n be an m √ó n matrix over R.

Let ùêÅ = [ b ]_n p be an n √ó p matrix over R.


Let ùêÄùêÅ be the product of ùêÄ with ùêÅ.

Then ùêÅ is pre-multiplied by ùêÄ.

Let ( R, +, ‚àò) be a ring.

Let ùêÄ = [ a ]_m n be an m √ó n matrix over R.

Let ùêÅ = [ b ]_n p be an n √ó p matrix over R.


Let ùêÄùêÅ be the product of ùêÄ with ùêÅ.

Then ùêÄ is post-multiplied by ùêÅ.

=== Using Einstein Summation Convention ===
Let ( R, +, ‚àò) be a ring.

Let ùêÄ = [ a ]_m n be an m √ó n matrix over R.

Let ùêÅ = [ b ]_n p be an n √ó p matrix over R.


The matrix product of ùêÄ and ùêÅ can be expressed using the Einstein summation convention as:

Then:
:c_i j := a_i k‚àò b_k j


The index which appears twice in the expressions on the   is the entry k, which is the one summated over.

=== Conformable Matrices ===
Let ùêÄ and ùêÅ be matrices.

It needs to be emphasised that matrix product can be defined on ùêÄ and ùêÅ  if and only if  ùêÄ and ùêÅ are conformable.


That is, if the number of rows of one is equal to the number of columns of the other.

=== Matrix Scalar Product ===
Let ùîΩ denote one of the standard number systems.

Let ‚Ñ≥(   )m, n be the m √ó n matrix space over ùîΩ.

Let ùêÄ = [ a ]_m n‚àà‚Ñ≥(   )m, n.

Let Œª‚ààùîΩ be any element of F.


The operation of scalar multiplication of ùêÄ by Œª is defined as follows.

Let ŒªùêÄ = ùêÇ.

Then:
:‚àÄ i ‚àà[ 1  . . ]m, j ‚àà[ 1  . . ]n: c_i j = Œª a_i j

ŒªùêÄ is the scalar product of Œª and ùêÄ.


Thus ùêÇ = [ c ]_m n is the m √ó n matrix composed of the product of Œª with the corresponding elements of ùêÄ.


=== Ring ===
Let ( R, +, ‚àò) be a ring.

Let ùêÄ = [ a ]_m n be an m √ó n matrix over ( R, +, ‚àò).

Let Œª‚àà R be any element of R.


The scalar product of Œª and ùêÄ is defined as follows.

Then:
:‚àÄ i ‚àà[ 1  . . ]m, j ‚àà[ 1  . . ]n: c_i j = Œª‚àò a_i j

Also known as matrix direct product:

Thus, if:
:ùêÄ is a matrix with order m √ó n
:ùêÅ is a matrix with order p √ó q

then ùêÄ‚äóùêÅ is a matrix with order m p √ó n q.

=== Real Data ===
Let D be a finite collection of n data regarding some quantitative variable.

Let the data in D be described by rational numbers or by real numbers.

Let d_min be the value of the smallest datum in D.

Let d_max be the value of the largest datum in D.
 
Let P = { x_0, x_1, x_2, ‚Ä¶, x_n - 1, x_n }‚äÜ‚Ñù be a subdivision of [ a  . . ]b, where a ‚â§ x_0 ‚â§ x_n ‚â§ b.


The closed real interval [ a  . . ]b, where a ‚â§ d_min‚â§ d_max‚â§ b, is said to be divided into class intervals of real intervals with endpoints x_i and x_i + 1  if and only if :

:Every datum is assigned into exactly one class interval

:Every class interval is disjoint from every other class interval

:The union of all class intervals contains the entire real interval [ x_0  . . ]x_n


The class intervals may be any combination of open, closed, or half-open intervals that fulfill the above criteria, but usually:

:Every class interval except the last is of the form [ x_i  . . ]x_i + 1

:The last class interval is of the form [ x_n - 1 . . ]x_n 

By convention, the first and last class intervals are not empty class intervals.

=== Boundary of Class Interval ===
The class boundaries of a class interval are the endpoints of the integer interval or real interval which defines the class interval.

=== Class Mark ===
A class mark is a value within a class interval used to identify that class interval uniquely.

It is usual to use the midpoint.


=== Class Midpoint ===
When a class mark is defined to be the midpoint of the class interval it identifies, it is often called the class midpoint.

=== Empty Class Interval ===
A class interval is empty  if and only if  it is of frequency zero.

=== Relative Sizes of Class Interval ===

Let us define the relation ‚àº on T as follows:

369,Definition:Vector Quantity/Component,Component,"Let ùêö be a vector quantity embedded in an n-dimensional Cartesian coordinate system C_n.


Let ùêö be represented with its initial point at the origin of C_n.

Let ùêû_1, ùêû_2, ‚Ä¶, ùêû_n be the unit vectors in the positive direction of the coordinate axes of C_n.

Then:
:ùêö = a_1 ùêû_1 + a_2 ùêû_2 + ‚ãØ + a_3 ùêû_n

where:
:a_1 ùêû_1, a_2 ùêû_2, ‚Ä¶, a_3 ùêû_n are the component vectors of ùêö in the directions of ùêû_1, ùêû_2, ‚Ä¶, ùêû_n 
:a_1, a_2, ‚Ä¶, a_3 are the components of ùêö in the directions of ùêû_1, ùêû_2, ‚Ä¶, ùêû_n.


The number of components in ùêö is determined by the number of dimensions in the Cartesian coordinate system of its frame of reference.


A vector quantity with n components can be referred to as an n-vector.


It is usually more convenient to write ùêö as the ordered tuple ( a_1, a_2, ‚Ä¶, a_n ) instead of ùêö = a_1 ùêû_1 + a_2 ùêû_2 + ‚ãØ + a_3 ùêû_n.


There are two special cases:


=== Cartesian Plane ===
Let ùêö be a vector quantity embedded in a Cartesian plane P.


Let ùêö be represented with its initial point at the origin of P.

Let ùê¢ and ùê£ be the unit vectors in the positive direction of the x-axis and y-axis.

Then:
:ùêö = x ùê¢ + y ùê£

where:
:x ùê¢ and y ùê£ are the component vectors of ùêö in the ùê¢ and ùê£ directions
:x and y are the components of ùêö in the ùê¢ and ùê£ directions.


It is usually more convenient to write ùêö as the ordered pair ( x, y ) instead of ùêö = x ùê¢ + y ùê£.

Let ùêö be a vector quantity embedded in Cartesian 3-space S.

Let ùê¢, ùê£ and ùê§ be the unit vectors in the positive directions of the x-axis, y-axis and z-axis respectively.

Then:
:ùêö = x ùê¢ + y ùê£ + z ùê§

where:
:x ùê¢, y ùê£ and z ùê§ are the component vectors of ùêö in the ùê¢, ùê£, ùê§ directions
:x, y and z are the components of ùêö in the ùê¢, ùê£ and ùê§ directions.

It is usual to arrange that the coordinate axes form a right-handed Cartesian 3-space.
