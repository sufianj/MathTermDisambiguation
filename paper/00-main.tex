\begin{abstract}
In mathematical literature, terms can have multiple meanings based on context. Manual disambiguation across scholarly articles demands massive efforts from mathematicians. 
%This paper addresses the challenge of \st{automatically determining whether two definitions of a mathematical term are semantically different.}\ann{definiendum disambiguation, or automatically determining the equivalence of mathematical terms according to their definitions.}
This paper addresses the challenge of automatically determining whether two definitions of a mathematical term are semantically different.
%Unlike existing approaches in mathematical term disambiguation, which are based on document-level information or syntactic features, 
Specifically, the difficulties and how contextualized textual representation can help resolve the problem, are investigated.
%We construct a 
A new dataset MathD2 for %fine-grained 
mathematical term disambiguation is constructed with ProofWiki's disambiguation pages. %Given a definition containing an ambiguous term, the goal is to link it to its corresponding identifier, indicated by its page title in ProofWiki. %We then study two 
Then two approaches based on the contextualized textual representation %of the mathematical contents
are studied: (1) supervised classification based on the embedding of concatenated definition and title and (2) zero-shot prediction based on semantic textual similarity(STS) %the cosine similarity 
between definition and title. 
Both approaches achieve accuracy and macro F1 scores greater than 0.9 on the ground truth dataset, demonstrating the effectiveness of our methods for the automatic disambiguation of mathematical definitions. Our dataset, code and experimental results are available here: \url{https://anonymous.4open.science/r/ecir2025-4137-5B97} %Our results show challenges and promising applications of sentence embeddings for mathematical language processing and information retrieval.
