We will often write  $(\Y, (S_g)_{g \in G}, \pi^X_Y)$, $(\Y, \pi^X_Y)$ or just $\Y$, for the factor 
$(Y, \B_Y, \mu_Y, (S_g)_{g \in G}, \pi^X_Y)$.
If $U$ is a measure space and $f: Y \to U$ is a measurable map, we write $(\pi^X_Y)^* f: X \to U$ for the pullback $(\pi^X_Y)^* f := f \circ \pi^X_Y$.  Conversely, if $f \in L^2(\X)$, we write $(\pi^X_Y)_* f \in L^2(\Y)$ for the pushforward of $f$, and $\E(f|\Y) := (\pi^X_Y)^* (\pi^X_Y)_* f \in L^2(\X)$ for the conditional expectation of $f$ to $\Y$.  We say that $f \in L^2(\X)$ is \emph{$\B_Y$-measurable} if $f = \E(f|\Y)$, of equivalently if $f = (\pi^X_Y) F$ for some $F \in L^2(\Y)$.  We refer to $(\X, \pi^X_Y)$ as an \emph{extension} of the $G$-system $(Y, \B_Y, \mu_Y, (S_g)_{g \in G})$.  If $Y$ is a point,  $(\pi^X_{\pt})_* f = \int_X f\ d\mu_X$.

One factor $\Y = (Y, \B_Y, \mu_Y,(S_g)_{g \in \G}, \pi^X_Y)$ of $\X$  is said to \emph{extend} another factor $\Y' = (\Y', \B_{\Y'}, \mu_{\Y'},(S'_g)_{g \in \G}, \pi^X_{Y'})$ of $\X$ (or equivalently, $\Y'$ is a \emph{sub-factor} of $\Y$) if every $\Y'$-measurable function is also $\Y$-measurable; in this case, we write $\Y \geq \Y'$.  Two factors are said to be \emph{isomorphic} if they extend each other.  Note that the notion of extension is a partial order modulo measure equivalence.  When we say that a factor is \emph{maximal} (resp. \emph{minimal} ) with respect to some property, we mean that there is no extension (resp. sub-factor) of this factor, that obeys that property, which is not already equivalent to that factor.

We will often write  (, (S_g)_g ∈ G, π^X_Y), (, π^X_Y) or just , for the factor

If U is a measure space and f: Y → U is a measurable map, we write (π^X_Y)^* f: X → U for the pullback (π^X_Y)^* f := f ∘π^X_Y.  Conversely, if f ∈ L^2(), we write (π^X_Y)_* f ∈ L^2() for the pushforward of f, and (f|) := (π^X_Y)^* (π^X_Y)_* f ∈ L^2() for the conditional expectation of f to .

Which do you prefer?}
%\jc{I just added ""weakly"" in brackets; it should be enough (I prefer not to insist too much on this point, but it's true it needed some corrections). Strong connectivity leads to nothing; our intersections graphs do not have any cycle.}
%\nz{The parenthetical looks fine to me; another alternative would be to explicitly distinguish the ``oriented intersection graph'' (as defined above) from the ``intersection graph'' (= underlying undirected graph of the oriented intersection graph), and then define connected diagrams in terms of the latter...but I guess that's just a less concise way of saying ``weakly connected'', and I don't think there are other places where we would want to refer to the unoriented intersection graph(?).

A \emph{marking} of a floor diagram $\D$ is defined by the following
four step process

{\bf Step 1:} 
For each vertex $j$ of $\D$ create $s_j$ new indistinguishable vertices and
connect them to $j$ with new edges directed towards $j$.

{\bf Step 2:} For each vertex $j$ of $\D$ create $m+s_j- div(j)$ new
indistinguishable vertices and connect them to $j$ with new edges
directed away from $j$. This makes the divergence of vertex $j$ equal
to $m$.


{\bf Step 3:} Subdivide each edge of the original floor
diagram $\D$ into two
directed edges by introducing a new
vertex for each edge. The new edges inherit their weights and orientations. Denote the
resulting graph $\widetilde{\D}$.

\item $\#i - \#(-i) \geq 0$,
\item $\#i-\#(-i)\geq \#(i+1)-\#(-i-1)$,
\item if the last letter is $0$ then $\#k-\#(-k)>0$.

The partition $(\#1-\#(-1),\#2-\#(-2),\dots, \#k - \#(-k))$ is the \emph{weight} of a highest weight word. The vacillating tableau corresponding to a word $w$ is the sequence of weights of the initial segments of $w$.
\item Riordan paths are Motzkin paths without horizontal steps on the $x$-axis. They consist of up (north-east) steps, down (south-east) steps, and horizontal (east) steps, such that there is no step beneath the $x$-axis and no horizontal step on the $x$-axis.

A $k$-tuple of Riordan paths of length $r$ is a vacillating tableau of length $r$ if it meets the following conditions:
\begin{itemize}
\item The first path is a Riordan path of length $r$.
\item Path $i$ has steps where path $i-1$ has horizontal steps. Path $i$ is never higher than path $i-1$.
\end{itemize}
For a better readability we sometimes label the steps with $1,\dots,r$ in order to see which steps belong together and shift paths together.

The corresponding highest weight word is described as follows: A value $i$ is an up-step in path $i$ and a horizontal step in paths $1$ up to $i-1$. Similarly a value $-i$ is a down-step in path $i$ and a horizontal step in paths $1$ up to $i-1$ and a value $0$ is a horizontal step in every path, including $k$.

  * Riordan paths are Motzkin paths without horizontal steps on the x-axis. They consist of up (north-east) steps, down (south-east) steps, and horizontal (east) steps, such that there is no step beneath the x-axis and no horizontal step on the x-axis.

A k-tuple of Riordan paths of length r is a vacillating tableau of length r if it meets the following conditions:


  * The first path is a Riordan path of length r.

  * Path i has steps where path i-1 has horizontal steps. Path i is never higher than path i-1.

For a better readability we sometimes label the steps with 1,…,r in order to see which steps belong together and shift paths together.

The corresponding highest weight word is described as follows: A value i is an up-step in path i and a horizontal step in paths 1 up to i-1. Similarly a value -i is a down-step in path i and a horizontal step in paths 1 up to i-1 and a value 0 is a horizontal step in every path, including k.

Let  be a simplicial complex on the set [m], and let _1, …, _m be a set of m simplicial complexes. We refer to the simplicial complex

    (_1, …, _m) = {I_j_1⊔…⊔ I_j_k |  I_j_l∈_j_l,  l = 1,…, k   and  {j_1, …, j_k}∈}

as the substitution of _1, …, _m into .


The set of missing faces MF((_1, …, _m)) of a substitution complex can be described as follows. First, every missing face of each _i is the missing face of (_1, …, _m). Second, for every missing face Δ(i_1, …, i_k) of  we have the following set of missing faces of the substitution complex:

    MF_i_1,…, i_k((_1, …, _m)) = 
      {Δ(j_1, …, j_k) |  j_l ∈_i_l,  l =1,…, k}.

It is easy to see that there are no other missing faces in (_1, …, _m), so we have

    MF((_1, …, _m)) = MF
