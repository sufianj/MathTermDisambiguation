As with nonstandard objects, any operation or relation on standard spaces can be converted to a nonstandard analogue in the usual manner.  For instance, the nonstandard cardinality of a nonstandard finite set $X = \prod_{\n \to \alpha} X_\n$ is the nonstandard natural number
$$ |X| := \lim_{\n \to \alpha} |X_\n|.$$
Note that this is a different concept from the usual (or \emph{external} ) cardinality of $X$; indeed, nonstandard finite sets usually have an uncountable external cardinality.

We refer to the ultraproduct of standard sets as an nonstandard set ; in a similar vein, an ultraproduct of standard finite sets is a nonstandard finite set , and an ultraproduct of standard finite fields is a nonstandard finite field .

We will refer to the ultrapower  𝔘 of the standard universe 𝔘 as the nonstandard universe .

In a similar spirit, if f_: X_→ Y_ is a collection of standard functions between standard sets X_,Y_, we can form the ultralimit f := lim_→α f_ to be the function from X := ∏_→α X_ to Y := ∏_→α Y_ defined by the formula

We refer to such functions as nonstandard functions (also known as internal functions in the nonstandard analysis literature).

As with nonstandard objects, any operation or relation on standard spaces can be converted to a nonstandard analogue in the usual manner.  For instance, the nonstandard cardinality of a nonstandard finite set X = ∏_→α X_ is the nonstandard natural number

A \emph{marking} of a floor diagram $\D$ is defined by the following
four step process. % that we illustrate in the case of Example [[fill this in]].

{\bf Step 1:} For each vertex $j$ of $\D$, create $s_j$ new indistinguishable vertices and
connect them to $j$ with new edges directed towards $j$. 
%[[Illustrate this by an example]]

{\bf Step 2:} For each vertex $j$ of $\D$, create $r_j - l_j + s_j- \textrm{div}(j)$ new indistinguishable vertices and
connect them to $j$ with new edges directed away from $j$. This makes the divergence of vertex $j$ equal to $r_j - l_j$ for $1 \leq j \leq M$.


{\bf Step 3:} Subdivide each edge of the original floor
diagram $\D$ into two
directed edges by introducing a new
vertex for each edge. The new edges inherit their weights and orientations. Denote the
resulting graph $\tilde{\D}$.
