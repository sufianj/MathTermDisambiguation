Good partial embedding,"\label{def:gpe}
 Given $k\ge 2$, a $k$-complex $H$ of maximum degree $\Delta$, integers $c^*$, $h^*$, and for each $0\le\ell\le k$ a density $k$-graph $\cD\tl$ on $V(H)$, let $\delta_1,\dots,\delta_k$, $\eta_0,\dotsc,\eta_k$, and $\big(\eps_{\ell,r,h}\big)_{\ell,r\in[k],h\in[h^*]}$ be a valid ensemble of parameters. 
 Given $1\le\ell\le k$, we say that a partial embedding $\phi$ of $H$ together with a stack of candidate graphs $\cC^{(0)},\dots,\cC^{(\ell)}$ is an \emph{$\ell$-good partial embedding} ($\ell$-GPE) if
 \begin{enumerate}[label=\textup{(GPE\arabic*)}]
  \item\label{gpe:c0}
   The graph $\cC\tz$ is an $\big(\eta_0,c^*\big)$-THC graph with density graph $\cD\tz_\phi$.
  \item\label{gpe:reg}
  For each $1\le\ell'\le \ell$ and $\emptyset\neq e\subset V(H)\setminus\dom\phi$, the graph $\tcC^{(\ell')}(e)$ is $(\eps,d)$-regular with respect to $\ocC^{(\ell'-1)}(e)$, where
  \[\eps=\eps_{\ell',|e|,\pi_\phi(e)}\quad\text{ and }\quad d=d^{(\ell')}_\phi(e)=\prod_{\substack{f\subset V(H),\\e\subset f,\,f\setminus e\subset\dom\phi}}d^{(\ell')}(f)\,.\]
  \item\label{gpe:dens}
  The parameters $\delta_1,\dotsc,\delta_\ell$ are `global' lower bounds on the relative density terms in the sense that for each $1\le\ell'\le\ell$ and $\emptyset\neq e\subset V(H)\setminus\dom\phi$, we have

For a skew shifted tableau with entries i_j or i'_j for i‚àà{1,2,‚Ä¶} where j is any symbol, we call i the gene family of an entry i_j or i'_j and j the gene . Two such tableaux are equivalent if they are the same up to a relabeling of the genes j.  An equivalence class T of these tableaux is a semistandard genomic tableau if:


  * The tableau T_ss obtained by forgetting the gene subscripts is semistandard and in canonical form.

  * Each gene j consists only of letters i_j and i'_j for some i, and its letters are consecutive in standardization order.

  * For every primed entry i'_j, there is an unprimed letter i_k preceding it in reading order from the same family i but different gene k‚â† j.

  * No two squares of the same gene are horizontally or vertically adjacent.

The K-theoretic content of T is (c_1, ‚Ä¶, c_r) where c_i is the number of genes in the i-th family. Finally, T is ballot if it is semistandard and has the following property:

A marking of a floor diagram  is defined by the following
four step process. 

Step 1: For each vertex j of , create s_j new indistinguishable vertices and
connect them to j with new edges directed towards j. 


Step 2: For each vertex j of , create r_j - l_j + s_j- div(j) new indistinguishable vertices and
connect them to j with new edges directed away from j. This makes the divergence of vertex j equal to r_j - l_j for 1 ‚â§ j ‚â§ M.


Step 3: Subdivide each edge of the original floor
diagram  into two
directed edges by introducing a new
vertex for each edge. The new edges inherit their weights and orientations. Denote the
resulting graph .

    ùê´ - ùê•   =    (1,1,0,1)





Step 4: Linearly order the vertices of 
extending the order of the vertices of the original floor
diagram  such that, as before, each edge is directed from a
smaller vertex to a larger vertex.

The extended graph  together with the linear order on
its vertices is called a marked floor diagram , or a
marking of the original floor diagram .

Let $\sk$ be a simplicial complex on the set $[m]$, and let $\sk_1, \dots, \sk_m$ be a set of $m$ simplicial complexes. We refer to the simplicial complex
\begin{equation}\label{substitution_equation}
\sk(\sk_1, \dots, \sk_m) = \{I_{j_1}\sqcup\dots\sqcup I_{j_k}\,|\; I_{j_l}\in \sk_{j_l},\; l = 1,\dots, k \quad\text{and}\quad \{j_1, \dots, j_k\}\in \sk\}
\end{equation}
as the \emph{substitution} of $\sk_1, \dots, \sk_m$ into $\sk$.

%\begin{remark}\label{substitution_mf}
The set of missing faces $\mathop\mathrm{MF}(\sk(\sk_1, \dots, \sk_m))$ of a substitution complex can be described as follows. First, every missing face of each $\sk_i$ is the missing face of $\sk(\sk_1, \dots, \sk_m)$. Second, for every missing face $\Delta(i_1, \dots, i_k)$ of $\sk$ we have the following set of missing faces of the substitution complex:
\[
	\mathop\mathrm{MF}\nolimits_{i_1,\dots, i_k}\bigl(\sk(\sk_1, \dots, \sk_m)\bigr) = 
  \bigl\{\Delta(j_1, \dots, j_k)\,|\; j_l \in \sk_{i_l},\; l =1,\dots, k\bigr\}.
\]
It is easy to see that there are no other missing faces in $\sk(\sk_1, \dots, \sk_m)$, so we have
\[
	\mathop\mathrm{MF}\bigl(\sk(\sk_1, \dots, \sk_m)\bigr) = \mathop\mathrm{MF}  
  (\sk_1)\sqcup\dots\sqcup\mathop\mathrm{MF}

Given a sequence $(x_\n)_{\n \in \N}$ of standard objects in ${\mathfrak U}$, we define their \emph{ultralimit} $\lim_{\n \to \alpha} x_\n$ to be the equivalence class of all sequences $(y_\n)_{\n \in \N}$ of standard objects in ${\mathfrak U}$ such that $x_\n = y_\n$ for $\n$ sufficiently close to $\alpha$.  Note that the ultralimit $\lim_{\n \to \alpha} x_\n$ can also be defined even if $x_\n$ is only defined for $\n$ sufficiently close to $\alpha$.

An ultralimit of standard natural numbers is known as a \emph{nonstandard natural number} , an ultralimit of standard real numbers is known as a \emph{nonstandard real number} , and so on.

For any standard object $x$, we identify $x$ with its own ultralimit $\lim_{\n \to \alpha} x$.  Thus, every standard natural number is a nonstandard natural number, etc.

Any operation or relation on standard objects can be extended to nonstandard objects in the obvious manner.  Indeed, if $O$ is a $k$-ary operation, we define
$$ O( \lim_{\n \to \alpha} x^1_\n, \ldots, \lim_{\n \to \alpha} x^k_\n ) := \lim_{\n \to \alpha} O( x^1_\n, \ldots, x^k_\n ) $$
and if $R$ is a $k$-ary relation, we define $R(\lim_{\n \to \alpha} x^1_\n, \ldots, \lim_{\n \to \alpha} x^k_\n )$ to be true iff $R(x^1_\n,\ldots,x^k_\n)$ is true for all $\n$ sufficiently close to $\alpha$.
