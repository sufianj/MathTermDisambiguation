Definition:Argument,Argument,"A logical argument (or just argument) is a process of creating a new statement from one or more existing statements.

An argument proceeds from a set of premises to a conclusion, by means of logical implication, via a procedure called logical inference.


An argument may have more than one premise, but only one conclusion.


While statements may be classified as either true or false, an argument may be classified as either valid or invalid.


Loosely speaking, a valid argument is one that leads unshakeably from true statements to other true statements, whereas an invalid argument is one that can lead you to, for example, a false statement from one which is true.


Thus:
:An argument may be valid, even though its premises are false.
:An argument may be invalid, even though its premises are true.
:An argument may be invalid and its premises false.

It is even possible for the conclusion of an argument to be true, even though the argument is invalid and its premises are false.


To be sure of the truth of a conclusion, it is necessary to make sure both that the premises are true and that the argument is valid.


However, while you may not actually know whether a statement is true or not, you can investigate the consequences of it being either true or false, and see what effect that has on the truth value of the proposition(s) of which it is a part. That, in short, is what the process of logical argument consists of.


An argument may be described symbolically by means of sequents, which specify the flow of an argument.


=== Finitary Argument ===

A valid argument is a logical argument in which the premises provide conclusive reasons for the conclusion.


When a proof is valid, we may say one of the following:
* The conclusion follows from the premises;
* The premises entail the conclusion;
* The conclusion is true on the strength of the premises;
* The conclusion is drawn from the premises;
* The conclusion is deduced from the premises;
* The conclusion is derived from the premises.


=== Proof ===

If all the premises of a valid argument are true, then the conclusion must also therefore be true.

It is not possible for the premises of a valid argument to be true, but for the conclusion to be false.


An invalid argument is a argument in which the premises do not provide conclusive reasons for the conclusion.

While statements may be classified as either true or false, an argument may be classified as either valid or invalid.


Loosely speaking, a valid argument is one that leads unshakeably from true statements to other true statements, whereas an invalid argument is one that can lead you to, for example, a false statement from one which is true.


Thus:
:An argument may be valid, even though its premises are false.
:An argument may be invalid, even though its premises are true.
:An argument may be invalid and its premises false.

It is even possible for the conclusion of an argument to be true, even though the argument is invalid and its premises are false.


To be sure of the truth of a conclusion, it is necessary to make sure both that the premises are true and that the argument is valid.


However, while you may not actually know whether a statement is true or not, you can investigate the consequences of it being either true or false, and see what effect that has on the truth value of the proposition(s) of which it is a part. That, in short, is what the process of logical argument consists of.


An argument may be described symbolically by means of sequents, which specify the flow of an argument.

The machine examines one square at a time, and carries out an action determined by both:

=== Formal Definition ===


A Turing machine is a 7-tuple $\paren {Q, \Sigma, \Gamma, \delta, q_0, B, F}$ that satisfies the following:
* $Q$ is a finite set, the states of the machine.
* $\Sigma$ is a finite set, the input symbols.
* $\Gamma \supsetneq \Sigma$ is a finite superset of the input symbols, called the tape symbols.
** For convenience, we also require that $\Gamma$ and $Q$ are disjoint.
* $\delta : Q \times \Gamma \to Q \times \Gamma \times \set {L, R}$ is a partial mapping, the transition function.
** $L$ and $R$ are arbitrary constants called directions.
* $q_0 \in Q$ is a distinguished state called the start state.
* $B \in \Gamma$ is a distinguished tape symbol called the blank symbol. $B$ must not be an element of $\Sigma$.
* $F \subset Q$ be a designated subset of the states called accepting states.


An instantaneous description of a Turing machine is a finite sequence of elements of $\Gamma \cup Q$, subject to the following conditions:
* There is exactly one element of $Q$ in the sequence.
* The first entry in the sequence is not $B$.
* The last entry in the sequence is not in $Q$.
* If the last entry in the sequence is $B$, then the second-to-last is in $Q$.

By this definition, an instantaneous description can always be written as:
:$X_m X_{m-1} \dotsm X_2 X_1 q Y Z_1 Z_2 \dotsm Z_{n-1} Z_n$
where $m$ or $n$ may be $0$; $X_i$, $Y$, and $Z_j$ are all elements of $\Gamma$; and $q$ is an element of $Q$.

Additionally, $X_m$ and $Z_n$ are not $B$ if they exist; that is, if $m$ and $n$ are not $0$, respectively.


A move reduces one instantaneous description into another by applying the transition function.

We write $A \vdash B$ if a machine with instantaneous description $A$ has, after a single move, instantaneous description $B$.

Let $\map \delta {q, Y} = \paren{q', Y', d}$.

Then there are seven cases to consider:

* If $d = L$ and $m > 0$, and either $n > 0$ or $Y' \neq B$ then:
:$X_m \dotsm X_2 X_1 q Y Z_1 \dotsm Z_n \vdash X_m \dotsm X_2 q' X_1 Y' Z_1 \dotsm Z_n$

* If $d = L$ and $m > 0$, but $n = 0$ and $Y' = B$ then:
:$X_m \dotsm X_2 X_1 q Y \vdash X_m \dotsm X_2 q' X_1$

* If $d = L$ but $m = 0$, and either $n > 0$ or $Y' \neq B$ then:
:$q Y Z_1 \dotsm Z_n \vdash q' B Y' Z_1 \dotsm Z_n$

* If $d = R$ and $n > 0$, and either $m > 0$ or $Y' \neq B$ then:
:$X_m \dotsm X_1 q Y Z_1 Z_2 \dotsm Z_n \vdash X_m \dotsm X_1 Y' q' Z_1 Z_2 \dotsm Z_n$

* If $d = R$ and $n > 0$, but $m = 0$ and $Y' = B$ then:
:$q Y Z_1 Z_2 \dotsm Z_n \vdash q' Z_1 Z_2 \dotsm Z_n$

* If $d = R$ but $n = 0$, and either $m > 0$ or $Y' \neq B$ then:
:$X_m \dotsm X_1 q Y \vdash X_m \dotsm X_1 Y' q' B$

* If $m = 0$, $n = 0$, and $Y' = B$ then regardless of $d$:
:$q Y \vdash q' B$


Let $A \vdash^* B$ indicate that there exists a finite sequence $\sequence {A_i}_{0 \leq i \leq n}$ such that:
:$A = A_0 \vdash A_1 \vdash A_2 \vdash \dotso \vdash A_n = B$


The language $\map L M$ accepted by the machine $M$ is the set of strings $w \in \Sigma^*$ for which, for some $\alpha, \beta \in \Gamma^*$ and $p \in F$:
:$q_0 w \vdash^* \alpha p \beta$

As a special case, the null string is in the language  the above holds for $w = B$.


A machine $M$ halts on an input $w$, using the same special case for the null string as above,  for some $\alpha, \beta \in \Gamma^*$, $X \in \Gamma$, and $q \in Q$:
:$q_0 w \vdash^* \alpha q X \beta$

* Q is a finite set, the states of the machine.
* Œ£ is a finite set, the input symbols.
* Œì‚äãŒ£ is a finite superset of the input symbols, called the tape symbols.
** For convenience, we also require that Œì and Q are disjoint.
* Œ¥ : Q √óŒì‚Üí Q √óŒì√óL, R is a partial mapping, the transition function.
** L and R are arbitrary constants called directions.
* q_0 ‚àà Q is a distinguished state called the start state.
* B ‚ààŒì is a distinguished tape symbol called the blank symbol. B must not be an element of Œ£.
* F ‚äÇ Q be a designated subset of the states called accepting states.


An instantaneous description of a Turing machine is a finite sequence of elements of Œì‚à™ Q, subject to the following conditions:
* There is exactly one element of Q in the sequence.
* The first entry in the sequence is not B.
* The last entry in the sequence is not in Q.
* If the last entry in the sequence is B, then the second-to-last is in Q.

By this definition, an instantaneous description can always be written as:
:X_m X_m-1‚Ä¶ X_2 X_1 q Y Z_1 Z_2 ‚Ä¶ Z_n-1 Z_n
where m or n may be 0; X_i, Y, and Z_j are all elements of Œì; and q is an element of Q.

Additionally, X_m and Z_n are not B if they exist; that is, if m and n are not 0, respectively.


A move reduces one instantaneous description into another by applying the transition function.

We write A ‚ä¢ B if a machine with instantaneous description A has, after a single move, instantaneous description B.

Let Œ¥q, Y = q', Y', d.
