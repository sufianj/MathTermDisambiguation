Definition:Argument,Argument,"A logical argument (or just argument) is a process of creating a new statement from one or more existing statements.

An argument proceeds from a set of premises to a conclusion, by means of logical implication, via a procedure called logical inference.


An argument may have more than one premise, but only one conclusion.


While statements may be classified as either true or false, an argument may be classified as either valid or invalid.


Loosely speaking, a valid argument is one that leads unshakeably from true statements to other true statements, whereas an invalid argument is one that can lead you to, for example, a false statement from one which is true.


Thus:
:An argument may be valid, even though its premises are false.
:An argument may be invalid, even though its premises are true.
:An argument may be invalid and its premises false.

It is even possible for the conclusion of an argument to be true, even though the argument is invalid and its premises are false.


To be sure of the truth of a conclusion, it is necessary to make sure both that the premises are true and that the argument is valid.


However, while you may not actually know whether a statement is true or not, you can investigate the consequences of it being either true or false, and see what effect that has on the truth value of the proposition(s) of which it is a part. That, in short, is what the process of logical argument consists of.


An argument may be described symbolically by means of sequents, which specify the flow of an argument.


=== Finitary Argument ===

A valid argument is a logical argument in which the premises provide conclusive reasons for the conclusion.


When a proof is valid, we may say one of the following:
* The conclusion follows from the premises;
* The premises entail the conclusion;
* The conclusion is true on the strength of the premises;
* The conclusion is drawn from the premises;
* The conclusion is deduced from the premises;
* The conclusion is derived from the premises.


=== Proof ===

If all the premises of a valid argument are true, then the conclusion must also therefore be true.

It is not possible for the premises of a valid argument to be true, but for the conclusion to be false.


An invalid argument is a argument in which the premises do not provide conclusive reasons for the conclusion.

Thus the construction:

:The number $n$ such that $P \left({n}\right)$ has the lower bound $N$.

: $S$ is the (finite) set of states
: $A \subseteq S$ is the set of accepting states
: $I \in S$ is the initial state
: $\Sigma$ is the alphabet of symbols that can be fed into the machine
: $T : \left({ S \times \Sigma }\right) \rightarrow S$ is the transition function.


A finite state machine operates as follows:

:$(1): \quad$ At the beginning, the current state $s$ of the finite state machine is $I$.
:$(2): \quad$ One by one, the input (a sequence of symbols from $\Sigma$) is fed into the machine.

If, at the end of processing an input word $w$, $s \in A$, the finite state machine is said to accept $w$, otherwise to reject it.

",Definition:Unlimited Register Machine,"['Definitions/Examples of Abstract Machines', 'Definitions/Unlimited Register Machines']"
Definition:Machine,Machine,"A Turing machine is an abstract machine which works by manipulating symbols on an imaginary piece of paper by means of a specific set of algorithmic rules.

To simplify things, the piece of paper being worked on is in the form of a series of boxes on a one-dimensional ""tape"" divided into squares.

Each square can be either blank or can contain a symbol taken from a finite set, e.g. $s_1, s_2, \ldots, s_\alpha$.


The machine examines one square at a time, and carries out an action determined by both:
:$(1): \quad$ the symbol in the square
:$(2): \quad$ the current internal state of the machine.

The internal state of the machine is a way of providing a device that can keep track of the symbols in other squares.

There can be only a finite set of these states, say $q_1, q_2, \ldots, q_\beta$.


The actions that the machine can take are as follows:
:$(1): \quad$ Replace the symbol in the square with another symbol
:$(2): \quad$ Move to examine the square in the immediate left of the current square being looked at
:$(3): \quad$ Move to examine the square in the immediate right of the current square being looked at.

After carrying out an action, the machine may change to a different internal state.


The program for the machine is a set of instructions which specify:
:$(1): \quad$ what action to take in some possible combinations of the internal state and symbol in the square currently being read
:$(2): \quad$ which internal state the machine moves into after carrying out that action.

Thus the instructions have the following form:
:$q_i \quad s_j \quad A \quad q_t$
which is interpreted as:

""If:
:* the machine is in internal state $q_i$
: the symbol in the square currently being examined is $s_j$
then:
: Carry out action $A$
: Move into internal state $q_t$.


The actions can be abbreviated to:
: $L$: Move one square to the left
: $R$: Move one square to the right
: $s_k$: Replace the symbol in the square currently being read with symbol $s_k$.


The computation stops when there is no instruction which specifies what should be done in the current combination of internal state and symbol being read.

=== Formal Definition ===


A Turing machine is a 7-tuple $\paren {Q, \Sigma, \Gamma, \delta, q_0, B, F}$ that satisfies the following:
* $Q$ is a finite set, the states of the machine.
* $\Sigma$ is a finite set, the input symbols.
* $\Gamma \supsetneq \Sigma$ is a finite superset of the input symbols, called the tape symbols.
** For convenience, we also require that $\Gamma$ and $Q$ are disjoint.
* $\delta : Q \times \Gamma \to Q \times \Gamma \times \set {L, R}$ is a partial mapping, the transition function.
** $L$ and $R$ are arbitrary constants called directions.
* $q_0 \in Q$ is a distinguished state called the start state.
* $B \in \Gamma$ is a distinguished tape symbol called the blank symbol. $B$ must not be an element of $\Sigma$.
* $F \subset Q$ be a designated subset of the states called accepting states.


An instantaneous description of a Turing machine is a finite sequence of elements of $\Gamma \cup Q$, subject to the following conditions:
* There is exactly one element of $Q$ in the sequence.
* The first entry in the sequence is not $B$.
* The last entry in the sequence is not in $Q$.
* If the last entry in the sequence is $B$, then the second-to-last is in $Q$.

By this definition, an instantaneous description can always be written as:
:$X_m X_{m-1} \dotsm X_2 X_1 q Y Z_1 Z_2 \dotsm Z_{n-1} Z_n$
where $m$ or $n$ may be $0$; $X_i$, $Y$, and $Z_j$ are all elements of $\Gamma$; and $q$ is an element of $Q$.

Additionally, $X_m$ and $Z_n$ are not $B$ if they exist; that is, if $m$ and $n$ are not $0$, respectively.


A move reduces one instantaneous description into another by applying the transition function.

We write $A \vdash B$ if a machine with instantaneous description $A$ has, after a single move, instantaneous description $B$.

Let $\map \delta {q, Y} = \paren{q', Y', d}$.

Then there are seven cases to consider:

* If $d = L$ and $m > 0$, and either $n > 0$ or $Y' \neq B$ then:
:$X_m \dotsm X_2 X_1 q Y Z_1 \dotsm Z_n \vdash X_m \dotsm X_2 q' X_1 Y' Z_1 \dotsm Z_n$

* If $d = L$ and $m > 0$, but $n = 0$ and $Y' = B$ then:
:$X_m \dotsm X_2 X_1 q Y \vdash X_m \dotsm X_2 q' X_1$

* If $d = L$ but $m = 0$, and either $n > 0$ or $Y' \neq B$ then:
:$q Y Z_1 \dotsm Z_n \vdash q' B Y' Z_1 \dotsm Z_n$

* If $d = R$ and $n > 0$, and either $m > 0$ or $Y' \neq B$ then:
:$X_m \dotsm X_1 q Y Z_1 Z_2 \dotsm Z_n \vdash X_m \dotsm X_1 Y' q' Z_1 Z_2 \dotsm Z_n$

* If $d = R$ and $n > 0$, but $m = 0$ and $Y' = B$ then:
:$q Y Z_1 Z_2 \dotsm Z_n \vdash q' Z_1 Z_2 \dotsm Z_n$

* If $d = R$ but $n = 0$, and either $m > 0$ or $Y' \neq B$ then:
:$X_m \dotsm X_1 q Y \vdash X_m \dotsm X_1 Y' q' B$

* If $m = 0$, $n = 0$, and $Y' = B$ then regardless of $d$:
:$q Y \vdash q' B$


Let $A \vdash^* B$ indicate that there exists a finite sequence $\sequence {A_i}_{0 \leq i \leq n}$ such that:
:$A = A_0 \vdash A_1 \vdash A_2 \vdash \dotso \vdash A_n = B$


The language $\map L M$ accepted by the machine $M$ is the set of strings $w \in \Sigma^*$ for which, for some $\alpha, \beta \in \Gamma^*$ and $p \in F$:
:$q_0 w \vdash^* \alpha p \beta$

As a special case, the null string is in the language  the above holds for $w = B$.


A machine $M$ halts on an input $w$, using the same special case for the null string as above,  for some $\alpha, \beta \in \Gamma^*$, $X \in \Gamma$, and $q \in Q$:
:$q_0 w \vdash^* \alpha q X \beta$

Definition:Tableau Proof,Tableau Proof,"A tableau proof for a proof system is a technique for presenting a logical argument in the form of a formal proof in a straightforward, standard form.

On , the proof system is usually natural deduction.


A tableau proof is a sequence of lines specifying the order of premises, assumptions, inferences and conclusion in support of an argument.


Each line of a tableau proof has a particular format. It consists of the following parts:

* Line: The line number of the proof. This is a simple numbering from 1 upwards.
* Pool: The list of all the lines containing the pool of assumptions for the formula introduced on this line.
* Formula: The propositional formula introduced on this line.
* Rule: The justification for introducing this line. This should be the rule of inference being used to derive this line.
* Depends on: The lines (if any) upon which this line directly depends. For premises and assumptions, this field will be empty.


Optionally, a comment may be added to explicitly point out possible intricacies.

If any assumptions are discharged on a certain line, for the sake of clarity it is preferred that such be mentioned explicitly in a comment.


At the end of a tableau proof, the only lines upon which the proof depends may be those which contain the premises.

:an alternating sequence of vertices $v_1, v_2, \ldots$ and edges $e_1, e_2, \ldots$ of $G$
:beginning and ending with a vertex
:in which edge $e_j$ of $W$ is incident with the vertex $v_j$ and the vertex $v_{j + 1}$.


A walk between two vertices $u$ and $v$ is called a $u$-$v$ walk.


To describe a walk on a simple graph it is sufficient to list just the vertices in order, as the edges (being unique between vertices) are unambiguous.
