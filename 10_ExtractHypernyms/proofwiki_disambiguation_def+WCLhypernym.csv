"['Definitions/Logical Arguments', 'Definitions/Logic']",Definition:Argument,"A logical argument (or just argument) is a process of creating a new statement from one or more existing statements.

An argument proceeds from a set of premises to a conclusion, by means of logical implication, via a procedure called logical inference.


An argument may have more than one premise, but only one conclusion.


While statements may be classified as either true or false, an argument may be classified as either valid or invalid.


Loosely speaking, a valid argument is one that leads unshakeably from true statements to other true statements, whereas an invalid argument is one that can lead you to, for example, a false statement from one which is true.


Thus:
:An argument may be valid, even though its premises are false.
:An argument may be invalid, even though its premises are true.
:An argument may be invalid and its premises false.

It is even possible for the conclusion of an argument to be true, even though the argument is invalid and its premises are false.


To be sure of the truth of a conclusion, it is necessary to make sure both that the premises are true and that the argument is valid.


However, while you may not actually know whether a statement is true or not, you can investigate the consequences of it being either true or false, and see what effect that has on the truth value of the proposition(s) of which it is a part. That, in short, is what the process of logical argument consists of.


An argument may be described symbolically by means of sequents, which specify the flow of an argument.


=== Finitary Argument ===

A valid argument is a logical argument in which the premises provide conclusive reasons for the conclusion.


When a proof is valid, we may say one of the following:

* The premises entail the conclusion;
* The conclusion is true on the strength of the premises;
* The conclusion is drawn from the premises;
* The conclusion is deduced from the premises;
* The conclusion is derived from the premises.

If all the premises of a valid argument are true, then the conclusion must also therefore be true.

An argument may be described symbolically by means of sequents, which specify the flow of an argument.


=== Finitary Argument ===

A logical argument (or just argument) is a process of creating a new statement from one or more existing statements.

An argument proceeds from a set of premises to a conclusion, by means of logical implication, via a procedure called logical inference.


An argument may have more than one premise, but only one conclusion.


While statements may be classified as either true or false, an argument may be classified as either valid or invalid.


Loosely speaking, a valid argument is one that leads unshakeably from true statements to other true statements, whereas an invalid argument is one that can lead you to, for example, a false statement from one which is true.


Thus:
:An argument may be valid, even though its premises are false.
:An argument may be invalid, even though its premises are true.
:An argument may be invalid and its premises false.

It is even possible for the conclusion of an argument to be true, even though the argument is invalid and its premises are false.


To be sure of the truth of a conclusion, it is necessary to make sure both that the premises are true and that the argument is valid.


However, while you may not actually know whether a statement is true or not, you can investigate the consequences of it being either true or false, and see what effect that has on the truth value of the proposition(s) of which it is a part. That, in short, is what the process of logical argument consists of.

=== Formal Definition ===


A Turing machine is a 7-tuple $left( Q, unicode{x3a3}, Gamma, delta, q_0, B, F right)$ that satisfies the following:
* $Q$ is a finite set, the states of the machine.
* $unicode{x3a3}$ is a finite set, the input symbols.
* $Gamma supsetneq unicode{x3a3}$ is a finite superset of the input symbols, called the tape symbols.
** For convenience, we also require that $Gamma$ and $Q$ are disjoint.
* $delta : Q times Gamma to Q times Gamma times leftlbrace L, R rightrbrace$ is a partial mapping, the transition function.
** $L$ and $R$ are arbitrary constants called directions.
* $q_0 in Q$ is a distinguished state called the start state.
* $B in Gamma$ is a distinguished tape symbol called the blank symbol. $B$ must not be an element of $unicode{x3a3}$.
* $F subset Q$ be a designated subset of the states called accepting states.


An instantaneous description of a Turing machine is a finite sequence of elements of $Gamma cup Q$, subject to the following conditions:
* There is exactly one element of $Q$ in the sequence.
* The first entry in the sequence is not $B$.
* The last entry in the sequence is not in $Q$.
* If the last entry in the sequence is $B$, then the second-to-last is in $Q$.

By this definition, an instantaneous description can always be written as:
:$X_m X_{m-1} dotsm X_2 X_1 q Y Z_1 Z_2 dotsm Z_{n-1} Z_n$
where $m$ or $n$ may be $0$; $X_i$, $Y$, and $Z_j$ are all elements of $Gamma$; and $q$ is an element of $Q$.

Additionally, $X_m$ and $Z_n$ are not $B$ if they exist; that is, if $m$ and $n$ are not $0$, respectively.


A move reduces one instantaneous description into another by applying the transition function.

We write $A vdash B$ if a machine with instantaneous description $A$ has, after a single move, instantaneous description $B$.

Let $delta left(   right){q, Y} = left( q', Y', d right)$.

Then there are seven cases to consider:

* If $d = L$ and $m > 0$, and either $n > 0$ or $Y' neq B$ then:
:$X_m dotsm X_2 X_1 q Y Z_1 dotsm Z_n vdash X_m dotsm X_2 q' X_1 Y' Z_1 dotsm Z_n$

* If $d = L$ and $m > 0$, but $n = 0$ and $Y' = B$ then:
:$X_m dotsm X_2 X_1 q Y vdash X_m dotsm X_2 q' X_1$

* If $d = L$ but $m = 0$, and either $n > 0$ or $Y' neq B$ then:
:$q Y Z_1 dotsm Z_n vdash q' B Y' Z_1 dotsm Z_n$

* If $d = R$ and $n > 0$, and either $m > 0$ or $Y' neq B$ then:
:$X_m dotsm X_1 q Y Z_1 Z_2 dotsm Z_n vdash X_m dotsm X_1 Y' q' Z_1 Z_2 dotsm Z_n$

* If $d = R$ and $n > 0$, but $m = 0$ and $Y' = B$ then:
:$q Y Z_1 Z_2 dotsm Z_n vdash q' Z_1 Z_2 dotsm Z_n$

* If $d = R$ but $n = 0$, and either $m > 0$ or $Y' neq B$ then:
:$X_m dotsm X_1 q Y vdash X_m dotsm X_1 Y' q' B$

* If $m = 0$, $n = 0$, and $Y' = B$ then regardless of $d$:
:$q Y vdash q' B$

['Definitions/Proof Systems'],Definition:Tableau Proof,"A tableau proof for a proof system is a technique for presenting a logical argument in the form of a formal proof in a straightforward, standard form.

On , the proof system is usually natural deduction.


A tableau proof is a sequence of lines specifying the order of premises, assumptions, inferences and conclusion in support of an argument.


Each line of a tableau proof has a particular format. It consists of the following parts:

* Line: The line number of the proof. This is a simple numbering from 1 upwards.
* Pool: The list of all the lines containing the pool of assumptions for the formula introduced on this line.
* Formula: The propositional formula introduced on this line.
* Rule: The justification for introducing this line. This should be the rule of inference being used to derive this line.
* Depends on: The lines (if any) upon which this line directly depends. For premises and assumptions, this field will be empty.


Optionally, a comment may be added to explicitly point out possible intricacies.

If any assumptions are discharged on a certain line, for the sake of clarity it is preferred that such be mentioned explicitly in a comment.


At the end of a tableau proof, the only lines upon which the proof depends may be those which contain the premises.
