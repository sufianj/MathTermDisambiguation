where P_1,…,P_J are homogeneous polynomials (resp. polynomials).  A projective (resp. affine) algebraic set is called irreducible if it cannot be written as the union of two proper projective (resp. affine) algebraic subsets, in which case we refer to the algebraic set as a variety .

The dimension of an algebraic set V is the smallest integer d such that intersections of V with generic codimension-d subspaces of ^N or ^N are finite.  If V is a projective variety of dimension d, then generic codimension d subspaces of ^N intersect V in a constant number of points, known as the degree of V.  Every affine variety can be embedded in a unique projective variety of the same dimension (the projective closure of the affine variety); we define the degree of the affine variety to be that of its projective closure.

  The definitions given here are classical in style, and thus subject to certain pathologies; for instance, one might expect the vanishing locus of a degree-d polynomial in 2 variables to be a curve of degree d, and this is generically the case: but if the polynomial is, for instance, (x+y)^d, then the vanishing locus is (according to our definition) a curve of degree 1.  Problems of this kind will change degrees at worst by bounded multiplicative constants, so we will systematically ignore them; in any event, all proofs in the paper work when the better-behaved scheme-theoretic definitions of dimension and degree are used.

For a skew shifted tableau with entries i_j or i'_j for i∈{1,2,…} where j is any symbol, we call i the gene family of an entry i_j or i'_j and j the gene . Two such tableaux are equivalent if they are the same up to a relabeling of the genes j.  An equivalence class T of these tableaux is a semistandard genomic tableau if:


  * The tableau T_ss obtained by forgetting the gene subscripts is semistandard and in canonical form.

For each r ≥ 3 and t ∈, the modified Zykov graph
Z_ℓ^r,t(T_1,…,T_ℓ) is the graph obtained from
Z_ℓ(T_1,…,T_ℓ) by performing the following two operations:

  
  * Add vertices W = { w_1, …, w_r-3}, and all edges with
    an endpoint in W.
  
  * Blow up each vertex u_I with I ⊂ [ℓ] and each
    vertex w_j in W to a set S_I or S'_j, respectively, of size t.

Finally, we shall write Z_ℓ^r,t for the modified Zykov graph obtained
when each tree T_i, i∈[ℓ], is a single edge; that is,
Z_ℓ^r,t = Z_ℓ^r,t(e_1,…,e_ℓ).",modified Zykov graph

A k-tuple of Riordan paths of length r is a vacillating tableau of length r if it meets the following conditions:


  * The first path is a Riordan path of length r.

  * Path i has steps where path i-1 has horizontal steps. Path i is never higher than path i-1.

For a better readability we sometimes label the steps with 1,…,r in order to see which steps belong together and shift paths together.

The corresponding highest weight word is described as follows: A value i is an up-step in path i and a horizontal step in paths 1 up to i-1. Similarly a value -i is a down-step in path i and a horizontal step in paths 1 up to i-1 and a value 0 is a horizontal step in every path, including k.

Q_132^(0,ℓ,0,0)|_t^nx^k is equal to the number of
  132-avoiding permutations in _n such that the packed
  of their suffix of length n + 1 -ℓ begins with value k+1.


Another interpretation of Proposition <ref> consists in noticing
that if a value σ_i has a greater value on its left, the first
value σ_1 of the permutation is also greater than
σ_i. By recurrence, a value σ_i having ℓ greater
values on their left is in fact smaller than the first ℓ values of
σ. This is due to the fact that if
σ_ℓ < σ_ℓ+1, then σ_ℓ+1 =
σ_ℓ+1 (132 avoidance implies that the remaining greater
values must be ordered) otherwise σ_ℓ > σ_ℓ+1
and a value seeing σ_ℓ+1 greater on its left sees also
σ_ℓ and by induction all previous values. Now, as having
ℓ greater values on the left is equivalent to be smaller than 
σ_ℓ, this can be checked using the Proposition <ref>
on the suffix of length n+1-ℓ that we pack by commodity
allowing us to keep 132-permutations (on smaller length when ℓ⩾ 2).
