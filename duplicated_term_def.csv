If $U$ is a measure space and $f: Y \to U$ is a measurable map, we write $(\pi^X_Y)^* f: X \to U$ for the pullback $(\pi^X_Y)^* f := f \circ \pi^X_Y$.  Conversely, if $f \in L^2(\X)$, we write $(\pi^X_Y)_* f \in L^2(\Y)$ for the pushforward of $f$, and $\E(f|\Y) := (\pi^X_Y)^* (\pi^X_Y)_* f \in L^2(\X)$ for the conditional expectation of $f$ to $\Y$.  We say that $f \in L^2(\X)$ is \emph{$\B_Y$-measurable} if $f = \E(f|\Y)$, of equivalently if $f = (\pi^X_Y) F$ for some $F \in L^2(\Y)$.  We refer to $(\X, \pi^X_Y)$ as an \emph{extension} of the $G$-system $(Y, \B_Y, \mu_Y, (S_g)_{g \in G})$.  If $Y$ is a point,  $(\pi^X_{\pt})_* f = \int_X f\ d\mu_X$.

One factor $\Y = (Y, \B_Y, \mu_Y,(S_g)_{g \in \G}, \pi^X_Y)$ of $\X$  is said to \emph{extend} another factor $\Y' = (\Y', \B_{\Y'}, \mu_{\Y'},(S'_g)_{g \in \G}, \pi^X_{Y'})$ of $\X$ (or equivalently, $\Y'$ is a \emph{sub-factor} of $\Y$) if every $\Y'$-measurable function is also $\Y$-measurable; in this case, we write $\Y \geq \Y'$.  Two factors are said to be \emph{isomorphic} if they extend each other.  Note that the notion of extension is a partial order modulo measure equivalence.  When we say that a factor is \emph{maximal} (resp. \emph{minimal} ) with respect to some property, we mean that there is no extension (resp. sub-factor) of this factor, that obeys that property, which is not already equivalent to that factor.

We say that a factor $\Y = (Y,  \B_Y, \mu_Y,(S_g)_{g \in G}, \pi^X_Y)$ is \emph{generated} by a collection ${\mathcal F}$ of measurable functions $f: X \to \C$ if the $\sigma$-algebra $(\pi^X_Y)^{-1}(\B_Y)$ is generated (modulo $\mu_X$-null sets) by the pre-images of level sets $T_g f^{-1}(V)$ of functions $f \in {\mathcal F}$, where $g \in G$ and $V$ ranges over Borel subsets of $\C$.  Equivalently, $\Y$ is the minimal factor such that all functions in ${\mathcal F}$ are $\B_Y$-measurable.","0901.2602#0901.2602.tex","definition[]"," A factor = (Y, _Y, μ_Y, (S_g)_g ∈ G, π^X_Y) of a G-system = (X, _X, μ_X, (T_g)_g ∈ G) is another G-system (Y, _Y, μ_Y, (S_g)_g ∈ G), together with a measurable factor map π^X_Y: X → Y, such that the push-forward (π^X_Y)_* μ_X of μ_X by π^X_Y is equal to μ_Y, and such that π^X_Y ∘ T_g = S_g ∘π^X_Y μ_X-a.e. for all g ∈ G.

\begin{enumerate}
\item deleting  $e$;
\item \emph{subdividing} $f$ with a new node $v'$;
\item \emph{suppressing} the indegree-1 outdegree-1 node $v$;
\item adding the edge $(u,v')$.
\end{enumerate}
\emph{Subdividing} an edge $(u,v)$ consists of deleting it and adding a node $x$ and edges $(u,x)$ and $(x,v)$. \emph{Suppressing} an indegree-1, outdegree-1 node $x$ with parent $u$ and child $v$ consists in removing  edges $(u,x)$ and $(x,v)$ and node $x$, and then adding an edge $(u,v)$.

Head moves are only allowed if the resulting digraph is still a network, see Definition \ref{def:networkTree}. 
We say that a head move is a \emph{distance-$d$} move if, after step 2, a shortest path from $v$ to $v'$ in the underlying undirected graph has length $d+1$ (number of edges in the path).","1708.07656#main_CS.tex","definition[]","

"Rooted bicolored forests of degree {\bf A}","\label{def:forest} In what follows we consider the set $\mathcal{F}({\bf A})$ of permuted rooted forests composed of:
\begin{itemize}
\item a bicolored identified ordered {\bf seed tree} with a white root vertex,
\item other bicolored ordered trees, called {\bf non-seed trees}  with either a white or a black root vertex,
\item each vertex of the forest has three kind of ordered descendants: {\bf tree-edges} (connecting a white and a black vertex), {\bf thorns} (half edges connected to only one vertex) and {\bf loops} connecting a vertex to itself. The two {\em extremities} of the loop are part of the ordered set of descendants of the incident vertex and therefore the loop can be intersected by thorns, edges and other loops as well.
\end{itemize}
The forests in $\mathcal{F}({\bf A})$ also have the following properties:
\begin{itemize}
\item the root vertices of the non-seed trees have at least one descending loop with one extremity being the rightmost descendant of the considered vertex,
\item the total number of thorns (resp. loops) connected to the white vertices is equal to the number of thorns (resp. loops) connected to the black ones,
%\item the total number of loops connected to the white vertices is equal to the number of loops connected to the black ones,

The \definand{intersection graph} of a chord diagram $C$ is defined as the digraph with a vertex for every chord, and an oriented edge from chord $(a,b)$ to chord $(c,d)$ whenever $a < c < b < d$.
A chord diagram is said to be \definand{connected} (or \emph{irreducible} ) if its intersection graph is (weakly) connected.
%\ky{A graph theorist pointed out to me that it should either say ``if its intersection graph is weakly connected'' or ``if its intersection graph is connected as a graph'' because connectivity as a digraph is ambiguous between strongly connected and weakly connected (and even worse, strongly connected would probably be one's first guess).  Which do you prefer?}
%\jc{I just added ""weakly"" in brackets; it should be enough (I prefer not to insist too much on this point, but it's true it needed some corrections). Strong connectivity leads to nothing; our intersections graphs do not have any cycle.}
%\nz{The parenthetical looks fine to me; another alternative would be to explicitly distinguish the ``oriented intersection graph'' (as defined above) from the ``intersection graph'' (= underlying undirected graph of the oriented intersection graph), and then define connected diagrams in terms of the latter...but I guess that's just a less concise way of saying ``weakly connected'', and I don't think there are other places where we would want to refer to the unoriented intersection graph(?).
%(Julien: I'm not sure what you mean by ``leads to nothing'', but our interesection graphs are \emph{not} always strongly connected, in the sense that there might not always be a directed path between a pair of chords.)}

Suppose we have already defined such bijections for labeled floor
diagrams of genus~$0$ and any degree~$<d$.
Now, for a diagram $\Dcal$ of degree~$d$, do the following.
Decompose $\Dcal$ into the root vertex~$d$ and
subdiagrams~$\Dcal_1,\dots,\Dcal_k$ on vertex sets $S_1,\dots,S_k$, as
described in the proof of Theorem~\ref{th:cayley} above.
Let $T_1,\dots,T_k$ denote the trees on vertex sets $S_1,\dots,S_k$
that correspond to $\Dcal_1,\dots,\Dcal_k$, respectively,
under the appropriate bijections.
The tree~$T$ associated to~$\Dcal$ under the bijection in question is
constructed by connecting each tree $T_i$ to the root vertex~$d$ by a single
edge $e'$ that is going to be determined by the unique weighted edge
$v\stackrel{e}{\longrightarrow}d$
connecting $\Dcal_i$ to~$d$ in~$\Dcal$.
It remains to describe the rule that determines~$e'$ from~$e$.
We have already checked (see~\eqref{eq:1-div}) that the total number
of choices for~$e$ is equal to~$|S_i|$.
Let us record those choices in an ordered list as the vertex~$v$ moves left

starting with the \emph{largest} possible weight value $w(e)=1-\divv_i(v)$ and
decreasing it until we reach the smallest possible weight value
$w(e)=1$.
We similarly list the $|S_i|$ choices available for the
edge $v'\stackrel{e'}{\longrightarrow}d$ connecting $S_i$ to~$d$ ;

A \emph{marking} of a floor diagram $\D$ is defined by the following
four step process

{\bf Step 1:} 
For each vertex $j$ of $\D$ create $s_j$ new indistinguishable vertices and
connect them to $j$ with new edges directed towards $j$.

{\bf Step 2:} For each vertex $j$ of $\D$ create $m+s_j- div(j)$ new
indistinguishable vertices and connect them to $j$ with new edges
directed away from $j$. This makes the divergence of vertex $j$ equal

{\bf Step 3:} Subdivide each edge of the original floor

A \emph{marking} of a floor diagram $\D$ is defined by the following
four step process. % that we illustrate in the case of Example [[fill this in]].

{\bf Step 1:} For each vertex $j$ of $\D$, create $s_j$ new indistinguishable vertices and

{\bf Step 2:} For each vertex $j$ of $\D$, create $r_j - l_j + s_j- \textrm{div}(j)$ new indistinguishable vertices and

Let $\underline{n}=(n_1,\ldots,n_{s-1})\in \ZZ_2^{s-1}$, let $x\in \ZZ_r$ and let $C_{\underline{n},x}$ be the cycle of length four of $\PX(2,r,s)$ given by 
$$((0,\underline{n},x),(\underline{n},0,x+1),(1,\underline{n},x),(\underline{n},1,x+1)).$$
Then $\cC:=\{C_{\underline{n},x}\mid \underline{n}\in \ZZ_2^{s-1},x\in\ZZ_r\}$ is a cycle decomposition of $\PX(2,r,s)$ into cycles of length four called the \emph{natural} cycle decomposition of $\PX(2,r,s)$. 
As the arc-transitive action of $\ZZ_2\wr \D_r$ on $\PX(2,r,s)$ induces a transitive action on $\cC$, we see that $\cC$ is arc-transitive.
The graph $\Split(\PX(2,r,s),\cC)$ is simply denoted by $\S(\PX(2,r,s))$.

It is not hard to see that the graph $\S(\PX(2,r,s))$ can also be described in the following way: its vertex-set is $\ZZ_2^s\times\ZZ_r\times\{+,-\}$ and its edge-set is $$\{\{(n_0,\ldots,n_{s-1},x,+),(n_1,\ldots,n_{s},x+1,-)\}\mid n_i\in \ZZ_2,x\in\ZZ_r\}~\cup\qquad$$
$$\qquad \{\{(n_0,\ldots,n_{s-1},x,+),(n_0,\ldots,n_{s-1},x,-)\}\mid n_i\in \ZZ_2,x\in\ZZ_r\}.$$
Observe that the wreath product $W:=\ZZ_2\wr\D_r=\ZZ_2^r\rtimes\D_r$ has a faithful action on $\V(\Gamma)=\ZZ_2^s\times\ZZ_r\times\{+,-\}$. Namely, for $g=(g_0,\ldots,g_{r-1},h)\in W$ (with $g_0,\ldots,g_{s-1}\in \ZZ_2$ and $h\in \D_r$), we have 
$$(n_0,n_1,\ldots,n_{s-1},x,\pm)^g=\begin{cases}(n_0^{g_x},n_1^{g_{x+1}},\ldots,n_{s-1}^{g_{x+s-1}},x^h,\pm) \textrm{ if } h\in\ZZ_r,\\

Another interpretation of Proposition~\ref{sigma1} consists in noticing
that if a value $\sigma_i$ has a greater value on its left, the first
value $\sigma_1$ of the permutation is also greater than
$\sigma_i$. By recurrence, a value $\sigma_i$ having $\ell$ greater
values on their left is in fact smaller than the first $\ell$ values of
$\sigma$. This is due to the fact that if
$\sigma_{\ell} < \sigma_{\ell+1}$, then $\sigma_{\ell+1} =
\sigma_{\ell}+1$ ($132$ avoidance implies that the remaining greater
values must be ordered) otherwise $\sigma_{\ell} > \sigma_{\ell+1}$
and a value seeing $\sigma_{\ell+1}$ greater on its left sees also
$\sigma_{\ell}$ and by induction all previous values. Now, as having
$\ell$ greater values on the left is equivalent to be smaller than 
$\sigma_\ell$, this can be checked using the Proposition~\ref{sigma1}

  For a finite set $V$, let $r(V)^* \df r(V)\setminus\{V\}$ and let $\mathcal{E}_V^* \df [0,1]^{r(V)^*}$. Again, as a shorthand, when $V=[k]$, we will write $r(k)^*$ and $\mathcal{E}_k^*$ instead of $r([k])^*$ and $\mathcal{E}_{[k]}^*$.

  Let $f\function{\mathcal{E}_V}{[0,1]}$. The function $f$ is said to be \emph{symmetric} if it is invariant under the action of $S_V$. Furthermore, the function $f$ is said to be \emph{measure preserving on the
  highest order argument} (h.o.a.) if it is measurable and for every $x^*\in\mathcal{E}_V^*$, the function
  \begin{align*}

      y & \longmapsto & f(x^*, y)
    \end{tabular}
  \end{align*}
  is measure preserving.

  Suppose now that $f = (f_1,\ldots,f_k)$ is a family of symmetric functions with $f_d\function{\mathcal{E}_d}{[0,1]}$. Then we define a new sequence $\widehat f =(\widehat f_1,\ldots,\widehat f_k)$ with
  $\widehat f_d\function{\mathcal E_d}{\mathcal E_d}$ by
  \begin{align*}
    \begin{functiondef}
      \widehat f_d(x)_A \df f_{\lvert A\rvert}(\alpha_A^\ast(x))\quad (A\in r(d)),
    \end{functiondef}
  \end{align*}
  where $\alpha_A\injection{[\lvert A\rvert]}{[d]}$ is a fixed injection with $\im(\alpha_A)=A$. This definition is independent of the choice of $\alpha_A$ since the function $f_{\lvert A\rvert}$ is symmetric, although in practice it is always convenient to take as $\alpha_A$ the enumeration of $A$ in the increasing order. As a consequence, $\widehat f_d$ is $S_d$-equivariant, and it is straightforward to check that all $\widehat f_d$'s are measure preserving in the ordinary sense. Note also that the diagram
  $$
  \begin{tikzcd}
    \mathcal E_D\arrow[r, ""\widehat f_D""]\arrow[d, ""\beta^\ast"", swap] & \mathcal E_D\arrow[d, ""\beta^\ast""]\\

  \end{tikzcd}
  $$
is commutative, where $1\leq d\leq D\leq k$ and $\beta\injection{[d]}{[D]}$ is an arbitrary injection. Hence (since $\beta^\ast$ is surjective) $\widehat f_1,\ldots,\widehat f_{k-1}$ are in principle completely determined by $\widehat f_k$.

Given a sequence $(x_\n)_{\n \in \N}$ of standard objects in ${\mathfrak U}$, we define their \emph{ultralimit} $\lim_{\n \to \alpha} x_\n$ to be the equivalence class of all sequences $(y_\n)_{\n \in \N}$ of standard objects in ${\mathfrak U}$ such that $x_\n = y_\n$ for $\n$ sufficiently close to $\alpha$.  Note that the ultralimit $\lim_{\n \to \alpha} x_\n$ can also be defined even if $x_\n$ is only defined for $\n$ sufficiently close to $\alpha$.
