Definition:Argument,Argument,"Let $z = x + i y$ be a complex number.

An argument of $z$, or $\arg z$, is formally defined as a solution to the pair of equations:
:$(1): \quad \dfrac x {\left\lvert z \right\rvert} = \cos \left(   \right){\arg z}$
:$(2): \quad \dfrac y {\left\lvert z \right\rvert} = \sin \left(   \right){\arg z}$
where $\left\lvert z \right\rvert$ is the modulus of $z$.

From Sine and Cosine are Periodic on Reals, it follows that if $\theta$ is an argument of $z$, then so is $\theta + 2 k \pi$ where $k \in \mathbb Z$ is any integer.


Thus, the argument of a complex number $z$ is a continuous multifunction.

 


=== Principal Range ===
It is understood that the argument of a complex number $z$ is unique only up to multiples of $2 k \pi$.

With this understanding, we can limit the choice of what $\theta$ can be for any given $z$ by requiring that $\theta$ lie in some half open interval of length $2 \pi$.

The most usual of these are:
:$\left[ 0 \,.\,.\,   \right){2 \pi}$
:$\left( -\pi \,.\,.\,   \right]\pi$

but in theory any such interval may be used.

This interval is known as the principal range.

=== Principal Argument ===
Let $R$ be the principal range of the complex numbers $\mathbb C$.

The unique value of $\theta$ in $R$ is known as the principal argument, of $z$.

This is denoted $\mathrm {Arg} \left( z \right)$.

Note the capital $A$.

The standard practice is for $R$ to be $\left( -\pi \,.\,.\,   \right]\pi$.

This ensures that the principal argument is continuous on the real axis for positive numbers.

Thus, if $z$ is represented in the complex plane, the principal argument $\mathrm {Arg} \left( z \right)$ is intuitively defined as the angle which $z$ yields with the real ($y = 0$) axis.

Definition:Argument,Argument,"A logical argument (or just argument) is a process of creating a new statement from one or more existing statements.

An argument proceeds from a set of premises to a conclusion, by means of logical implication, via a procedure called logical inference.


An argument may have more than one premise, but only one conclusion.


While statements may be classified as either true or false, an argument may be classified as either valid or invalid.


Loosely speaking, a valid argument is one that leads unshakeably from true statements to other true statements, whereas an invalid argument is one that can lead you to, for example, a false statement from one which is true.


Thus:
:An argument may be valid, even though its premises are false.
:An argument may be invalid, even though its premises are true.
:An argument may be invalid and its premises false.

It is even possible for the conclusion of an argument to be true, even though the argument is invalid and its premises are false.


To be sure of the truth of a conclusion, it is necessary to make sure both that the premises are true and that the argument is valid.


However, while you may not actually know whether a statement is true or not, you can investigate the consequences of it being either true or false, and see what effect that has on the truth value of the proposition(s) of which it is a part. That, in short, is what the process of logical argument consists of.


An argument may be described symbolically by means of sequents, which specify the flow of an argument.

:all the $r_j$ are such that $0 \le r_j < b$.

  
 

The number $b$ is known as the number base to which $n$ is represented.

In order to be able to perform the required addition, it is necessary to put the expressions $\dfrac a b$ and $\dfrac c d$ over a common denominator.


Hence the operation is:
:to multiply both the numerator (top) and denominator (bottom) of $\dfrac a b$ by $d$

:$(2): \quad c \mathrel \backslash a \land c \mathrel \backslash b \implies c \mathrel \backslash d$

Then $d$ is called a greatest common divisor of $a$ and $b$ (abbreviated GCD or gcd) and denoted $\gcd \left\lbrace a, b \right\rbrace$.


That is, in the integral domain $D$, $d$ is the GCD of $a$ and $b$  if and only if :

When the integral domain in question is the integers $\mathbb Z$, the GCD is often defined differently, as follows:
Let $a, b \in \mathbb Z: a \ne 0 \lor b \ne 0$.


The greatest common divisor of $a$ and $b$ is defined as:

Let $\angle BAC$ be a right angle.

Let $\angle BAD + \angle DAC = \angle BAC$.

Then $\angle DAC$ is the complement of $\angle BAD$.


Hence, for any angle $\alpha$ (whether less than a right angle or not), the complement of $\alpha$ is $\dfrac \pi 2 - \alpha$.

Measured in degrees, the complement of $\alpha$ is $90^\circ - \alpha$.


If $\alpha$ is the complement of $\beta$, then it follows that $\beta$ is the complement of $\alpha$.

Hence we can say that $\alpha$ and $\beta$ are complementary.


It can be seen from this that the complement of an angle greater than a right angle is negative.

=== Informal Definition ===
A complex number is a number in the form $a + b i$ or $a + i b$ where:
:$a$ and $b$ are real numbers
:$i$ is a square root of $-1$, that is, $i = \sqrt {-1}$.

=== Formal Definition ===
A complex number is an ordered pair $\left( x, y \right)$ where $x, y \in \mathbb R$ are real numbers, on which the operations of addition and multiplication are defined as follows:


=== Complex Addition ===
Let $\left( x_1, y_1 \right)$ and $\left( x_2, y_2 \right)$ be complex numbers.

Then $\left( x_1, y_1 \right) + \left( x_2, y_2 \right)$ is defined as:

:$\left( x_1, y_1 \right) + \left( x_2, y_2 \right):= \left( x_1 + x_2, y_1 + y_2 \right)$

=== Complex Multiplication ===
Let $\left( x_1, y_1 \right)$ and $\left( x_2, y_2 \right)$ be complex numbers.


Then $\left( x_1, y_1 \right) \left( x_2, y_2 \right)$ is defined as:

:$\left( x_1, y_1 \right) \left( x_2, y_2 \right) := \left( x_1 x_2 - y_1 y_2, x_1 y_2 + y_1 x_2 \right)$

=== Scalar Product ===
Let $\left( x, y \right)$ be a complex number.

Let $m \in \mathbb R$ be a real number.


Then $m \left( x, y \right)$ is defined as:

:$m \left( x, y \right) := \left( m x, m y \right)$

=== Construction from Cayley-Dickson Construction ===
The complex numbers can be defined by the Cayley-Dickson construction from the set of real numbers $\mathbb R$.

From Real Numbers form Algebra, $\mathbb R$ forms a nicely normed $*$-algebra.

Let $a, b \in \mathbb R$.

Then $\left( a, b \right) \in \mathbb C$, where:

:$\left( a, b \right) \left( c, d \right) = \left( a c - d \overline b, \overline a d + c b \right)$
:$\overline {\left( a, b \right) } = \left( \overline a, -b \right)$
where:
:$\overline a$ is the conjugate of $a$
and 
:$\overline {\left( a, b \right) }$ is the conjugation operation on $\mathbb C$.

From Real Numbers form Algebra, $\overline a = a$ and so the above translate into:

:$\left( a, b \right) \left( c, d \right) = \left( a c - d b, a d + c b \right)$
:$\overline {\left( a, b \right) } = \left( a, -b \right)$


It is clear by direct comparison with the formal definition that this construction genuinely does generate the complex numbers.",Definition:Complex Number,"['Definitions/Complex Numbers', 'Definitions/Standard Number Fields', 'Definitions/Numbers', 'Definitions/Complex Analysis', 'Definitions/Analysis']"
Definition:Complex,Complex,"A complex function is a function whose domain and codomain are subsets of the set of complex numbers $\mathbb C$.


=== Independent Variable ===
Let $f: \mathbb C \to \mathbb C$ be a complex function.

Let $f \left(   \right)z = w$.


Then $z$ is referred to as an independent variable (of $f$).

=== Dependent Variable ===
Let $f: \mathbb C \to \mathbb C$ be a complex function.

Let $f \left(   \right)z = w$.


Then $w$ is referred to as the dependent variable (of $f$).",Definition:Complex Function,"['Definitions/Complex Analysis', 'Definitions/Complex Functions']"
Definition:Complex,Complex,"Let $z = a + i b$ be a complex number.


Then the (complex) conjugate of $z$ is denoted $\overline z$ and is defined as:

:$\overline z := a - i b$


That is, you get the complex conjugate of a complex number by negating its imaginary part.


=== Complex Conjugation ===
The operation of complex conjugation is the mapping:
: $\overline \cdot: \mathbb C \to \mathbb C: z \mapsto \overline z$.
where $\overline z$ is the complex conjugate of $z$.


That is, it maps a complex number to its complex conjugate.

Definition:Complex,Complex,"Let $\left( S, \circ \right)$ be an algebraic structure.


We can define an operation on the power set $\mathcal P \left( S \right)$ as follows:

:$\forall A, B \in \mathcal P \left( S \right): A \circ_\mathcal P B = \left\lbrace a \circ b: a \in A, b \in B \right\rbrace$


This is called the operation induced on $\mathcal P \left( S \right)$ by $\circ$, and $A \circ_\mathcal P B$ is called the subset product of $A$ and $B$.


It is usual to write $A \circ B$ for $A \circ_\mathcal P B$.

When one of the subsets in a subset product is a singleton, we can (and often do) dispose of the set braces. Thus:
Let $\left( S, \circ \right)$ be an algebraic structure.

Let $K$ be a functional such that:

:$-\dfrac \mathrm d {\mathrm d x}  \left(   \right){\mathbf P \mathbf h'} + \mathbf Q \mathbf h = 0$

where $\mathbf P$ and $\mathbf Q$ are symmetric matrices.

Let the general solution to this equation be:

:$\left\lbrace \mathbf h^{\left( i \right)} = \left( \left\langle h_{ij}  \right\rangle  \right): i,j \in \mathbb N_{\le N}  \right\rbrace$

:$\left\lvert h_{i j}  \right\rvert \left( \tilde a \right) = 0$

Definition:Density,Density,"Density is a physical quantity that is variously specified according to context.

Its general meaning is that of some physical quantity per unit volume, or area, or length.


=== Mass Density ===
Mass density is a physical quantity.

The mass density of a body is its mass per unit volume.


For a homogeneous body it is found by finding its total mass and dividing it by its total volume:
:$\rho = \dfrac m V$
where:
:$m$ is the body's mass
:$V$ is the body's volume

However, if the substance of the body varies throughout, then its mass density may be a function of position within the body.

=== Dimension ===
The dimension of (mass) density is $\mathsf {M L}^{-3}$: mass per unit volume.


Category:Definitions/Mass Density

=== Units ===
* The SI units of mass density are $\mathrm {kg} \, \mathrm m^{-3}$ (kilograms per cubic metre).

* The CGS units of mass density are $\mathrm g \, \mathrm{cm}^{-3}$ or, less formally: $\mathrm g / \mathrm {cc}$ (grams per cubic centimetre).

* The FPS units of mass density are $\mathrm {lb} \, \mathrm {ft}^{-3}$ (pounds per cubic foot).


=== Conversion Factors ===


=== Area Mass Density ===
The area mass density of a two-dimensional body is its mass per unit area.


=== Symbol ===
The usual symbol used to denote area mass density is $\rho_A$ (Greek letter rho).

However, some sources simply use $\rho$ if the context makes it clear that it refers to area mass density rather than volume mass density.

Occasionally, $\sigma$ (Greek letter sigma) is also used, but this is more commonly used for surface charge density.

A directed graph or digraph $D$ is a non-empty set $V$ together with an antireflexive relation $E$ on $V$.

The elements of $E$ are the arcs.

=== Notation ===
The conventional notation for $x$ is a divisor of $y$ is ""$x \mid y$"", but there is a growing trend to follow the notation ""$x \mathrel \backslash y$"", as espoused by   etc.

From  :
:The notation '$m \mid n$' is actually much more common than '$m \mathrel \backslash n$' in current mathematics literature. But vertical lines are overused -- for absolute values, set delimiters, conditional probabilities, etc. -- and backward slashes are underused. Moreover, '$m \mathrel \backslash n$' gives an impression that $m$ is the denominator of an implied ratio. So we shall boldly let our divisibility symbol lean leftward.


An unfortunate unwelcome side-effect of this notational convention is that to indicate non-divisibility, the conventional technique of implementing $/$ through the notation looks awkward with $\mathrel \backslash$, so $\not \! \backslash$ is eschewed in favour of $\nmid$.


Some sources use $\ \vert \mkern -10mu {\raise 3pt -} \ $ or similar to denote non-divisibility.

=== Partial Embedding ===

A common method of constructing isomorphisms and elementary embeddings in proofs is to recursively define them a finite number of elements at a time.  For this  purpose, it is useful to have a definition of embeddings using functions which are only defined on a subset of $M$:


Let $A \subseteq M$ be a subset of $M$.

Let $x \in \mathbb R$ have a decimal expansion:
:$n. d_1 d_2 d_3 \ldots$


The dot that separates the integer part from the fractional part of $x$ is called the decimal point.

A number $x$ such that $\left\lvert x \right\rvert < 0$ has a units digit which is zero.

Definition:Expansion,Expansion,"=== Positive Real Numbers ===
Let $x \in \mathbb R$ be a real number such that $x \ge 0$.

Let $b \in \mathbb N: b \ge 2$.


Let us define the recursive sequence:
:$\forall n \in \mathbb N: n \ge 1: \left\langle f_n \right\rangle = \begin {cases}
b \left( x - \left\lfloor x \right\rfloor \right) & : n = 1 \\
b \left( f_{n - 1} - \left\lfloor f_{n - 1}  \right\rfloor  \right) & : n > 1
\end{cases}$

Then we define:
:$\forall n \in \mathbb N: n \ge 1: \left\langle d_n \right\rangle = \left\lfloor f_n \right\rfloor$


It follows from the method of construction and the definition of the floor function that:

:$\forall n: 0 \le f_n < b$ and hence $\forall n: 0 \le d_n \le b - 1$
:$\forall n: f_n = 0 \implies f_{n + 1} = 0$ and hence $d_{n + 1} = 0$.


Hence we can express $x = \left\lfloor x \right\rfloor + \displaystyle \sum_{j \mathop \ge 1} \frac {d_j} {b^j}$ as:
:$\left[ s \cdotp d_1 d_2 d_3 \ldots \right]_b$
where:
:$s = \left\lfloor x \right\rfloor$
:it is not the case that there exists $m \in \mathbb N$ such that $d_M = b - 1$ for all $M \ge m$.
(That is, the sequence of digits does not end with an infinite sequence of $b - 1$.)


This is called the expansion of $x$ in base $b$.

The generic term for such an expansion is a basis expansion.


It follows from the Division Theorem that for a given $b$ and $x$ this expansion is unique.

Just to specify that a body is made of the same substance throughout is not an adequate definition of homogeneous.

=== Indexing Function ===
Let $I$ and $S$ be sets.

Let $x: I \to S$ be a mapping.

Let $x_i$ denote the image of an element $i \in I$ of the domain $I$ of $x$.

Let $\left\langle x_i \right\rangle_{i \mathop \in I}$ denote the set of the images of all the element $i \in I$ under $x$.


When used in this context, the mapping $x$ is referred to as an indexing function for $S$.


=== Notation ===
The family of elements $x$ of $S$ indexed by $I$ is often seen with one of the following notations:

:$\left\langle x_i \right\rangle_{i \mathop \in I}$

:$\left( x_i \right)_{i \mathop \in I}$

:$\left\lbrace x_i \right\rbrace_{i \mathop \in I}$


There is little consistency in the literature, but $\left( x_i \right)_{i \mathop \in I}$ is perhaps most common.

The preferred notation on   is $\left\langle x_i \right\rangle_{i \mathop \in I}$.

The subscripted $i \in I$ is often left out, if it is obvious in the particular context.


Note the use of $x_i$ to denote the image of the index $i$ under the indexing function $x$.

As $x$ is actually a mapping, one would expect the conventional notation $x \left(   \right)i$.

However, this is generally not used, and $x_i$ is used instead.

Then the definite (Darboux) integral of $f$ over $\left[ a \,.\,.\,   \right]b$ is defined as:
:$\ds \int_a^b f \left(   \right)x \,\mathrm d x = \underline {\int_a^b} f \left(   \right)x \,\mathrm d x = \overline {\int_a^b} f \left(   \right)x \,\mathrm d x$


$f$ is formally defined as (properly) integrable over $\left[ a \,.\,.\,   \right]b$ in the sense of Darboux, or (properly) Darboux integrable over $\left[ a \,.\,.\,   \right]b$.

Definition:Intersection,Intersection,"Let $S$ and $T$ be sets.


The (set) intersection of $S$ and $T$ is written $S \cap T$.

It means the set which consists of all the elements which are contained in both of $S$ and $T$:

:$x \in S \cap T \iff x \in S \land x \in T$

or, more formally:

:$A = S \cap T \iff \forall z: \left( z \in A \iff z \in S \land z \in T \right)$


We can write:

:$S \cap T := \left\lbrace x: x \in S \land x \in T \right\rbrace$

and can voice it $S$ intersect $T$.


It can be seen that, in this form, $\cap$ is a binary operation which acts on sets.


One often says that two sets intersect  if and only if  they have non-empty intersection.


=== Set of Sets ===
Let $\Bbb S$ be a set of sets.

The intersection of $\Bbb S$ is:
:$\bigcap \Bbb S := \left\lbrace x: \forall S \in \Bbb S: x \in S \right\rbrace$
That is, the set of all objects that are elements of all the elements of $\Bbb S$.


Thus:
:$\bigcap \left\lbrace S, T \right\rbrace := S \cap T$

=== Family of Sets ===
Let $I$ be an indexing set.

Let $\left\langle S_i \right\rangle_{i \mathop \in I}$ be a family of sets indexed by $I$.


Then the intersection of $\left\langle S_i \right\rangle$ is defined as:

:$\ds \bigcap_{i \mathop \in I} S_i := \left\lbrace x: \forall i \in I: x \in S_i \right\rbrace$


=== In the context of the Universal Set ===

In treatments of set theory in which the concept of the universal set is recognised, this can be expressed as follows.

Let $\mathbb U$ be a universal set.

Let $I$ be an indexing set.

Let $\left\langle S_i \right\rangle_{i \mathop \in I}$ be an indexed family of subsets of $\mathbb U$.


Then the intersection of $\left\langle S_i \right\rangle$ is defined and denoted as:

:$\ds \bigcap_{i \mathop \in I} S_i := \left\lbrace x \in \mathbb U: \forall i \in I: x \in S_i \right\rbrace$

=== Subsets of General Set ===
This definition is the same when the universal set $\mathbb U$ is replaced by any set $X$, which may or may not be a universal set:

Let $I$ be an indexing set.

Let $\left\langle S_i \right\rangle_{i \mathop \in I}$ be an indexed family of subsets of a set $X$.


Then the intersection of $\left\langle S_i \right\rangle$ is defined as:

:$\ds \bigcap_{i \mathop \in I} S_i := \left\lbrace x \in X: \exists i \in I: x \in S_i \right\rbrace$
where $i$ is a bound variable.

=== Countable Intersection ===
Let $\mathbb S$ be a set of sets.

Let $\left\langle S_n \right\rangle_{n \mathop \in \mathbb N}$ be a sequence in $\mathbb S$.

Let $S$ be the intersection of $\left\langle S_n \right\rangle_{n \mathop \in \mathbb N}$:
:$\ds S = \bigcap_{n \mathop \in \mathbb N} S_n$


Then $S$ is a countable intersection of sets in $\mathbb S$.

=== Finite Intersection ===
Let $S = S_1 \cap S_2 \cap \ldots \cap S_n$.

Then:
:$\ds S = \bigcap_{i \mathop \in \mathbb N^*_n} S_i := \left\lbrace x: \forall i \in \mathbb N^*_n: x \in S_i \right\rbrace$
where $\mathbb N^*_n = \left\lbrace 1, 2, 3, \ldots, n \right\rbrace$.

Definition:Involution,Involution,"=== Natural Numbers ===
Let $\mathbb N$ denote the natural numbers.


For each $m \in \mathbb N$, recursively define $e_m: \mathbb N \to \mathbb N$ to be the mapping:
:$e_m \left({n}\right) = \begin{cases}
1 & : n = 0 \\

=== Rational Numbers ===
Let $x \in \mathbb R$ be a real number such that $x > 0$.

Let $m \in \mathbb Z$ be an integer.

Let $y = \sqrt [m] x$ be the $m$th root of $x$.


Then we can write $y = x^{1/m}$ which means the same thing as $y = \sqrt [m] x$.


Thus we can define the power to a positive rational number:

Let $r = \dfrac p q \in \mathbb Q$ be a positive rational number where $p \in \mathbb Z_{\ge 0}, q \in \mathbb Z_{> 0}$.

Then $x^r$ is defined as:
:$x^r = x^{p/q} = \left( \sqrt [q] x \right)^p = \sqrt [q] {\left( x^p \right) }$


When $r = \dfrac {-p} q \in \mathbb Q: r < 0$ we define:
:$x^r = x^{-p/q} = \dfrac 1 {x^{p/q} }$
analogously for the negative integer definition.

=== Real Numbers ===
Let $x \in \mathbb R_{>0}$ be a (strictly) positive real number.

Let $r \in \mathbb R$ be a real number.


We define $x^r$ as:

:$x^r := \exp \left(   \right){r \ln x}$
where $\exp$ denotes the exponential function.


This definition is an extension of the definition for rational $r$.

This follows from Logarithms of Powers and Exponential of Natural Logarithm: it can be seen that:
:$\forall r \in \mathbb Q: \exp \left(   \right){r \ln x} = \exp \left(   \right){\ln \left(   \right){x^r} } = x^r$

:$e^z$ is the exponential function
:$\ln$ is the  natural logarithm multifunction.


=== Principal Branch ===

:$z^k = e^{k \operatorname {Ln} z}$

where $\operatorname {Ln} z$ is the principal branch of the natural logarithm.


=== Positive Real Base ===
Let $t > 0$ be a real number and let $k$ be a complex number.

Definition:Isomorphism,Isomorphism,"Let $\left( S, \preceq_1 \right)$ and $\left( T, \preceq_2 \right)$ be ordered sets.

=== Definition 1 ===
Let $\left( S, \preceq_1 \right)$ and $\left( T, \preceq_2 \right)$ be ordered sets.


Let $\phi: S \to T$ be a bijection such that:

:$\phi: S \to T$ is order-preserving
:$\phi^{-1}: T \to S$ is order-preserving.

Then $\phi$ is an order isomorphism.


That is, $\phi$ is an order isomorphism  if and only if :

:$\phi$ is bijective
:$\forall x, y \in S: x \preceq_1 y \implies \phi \left(   \right)x \preceq_2 \phi \left(   \right)y$

=== Definition 2 ===

Then $\phi$ is an order isomorphism.

=== Well-Orderings ===

When $\preceq_1$ and $\preceq_2$ are well-orderings, the condition on the order preservation can be relaxed:

Let $\left( S, \preceq_1 \right)$ and $\left( T, \preceq_2 \right)$ be well-ordered sets.

Let $\phi: S \to T$ be a bijection such that $\phi: S \to T$ is order-preserving:
:$\forall x, y \in S: x \preceq_1 y \implies \phi \left(   \right)x \preceq_2 \phi \left(   \right)y$


Then $\phi$ is an order isomorphism.


Two well-ordered sets $\left( S, \preceq_1 \right)$ and $\left( T, \preceq_2 \right)$ are (order) isomorphic  if and only if  there exists such an order isomorphism between them.

Thus $\left( S, \preceq_1 \right)$ is described as (order) isomorphic to (or with) $\left( T, \preceq_2 \right)$, and vice versa.

This may be written $\left( S, \preceq_1 \right) \cong \left( T, \preceq_2 \right)$.

Circle knots can often be quite wild and unwieldy - most of modern knot theory concerns itself with a specific kind of knot.

These knots are described as a finite set of points in $\mathbb R^3$ called $\left\lbrace x_1, x_2, \dots, x_n \right\rbrace$, together with line segments from $x_i$ to $x_{i + 1}$ and a line segment from $x_n$ to $x_1$.

Let $c \in \left( a \,.\,.\,   \right)b$.

Let $f: \left( a \,.\,.\,   \right)b \setminus \left\lbrace c \right\rbrace \to \mathbb R$ be a real function.

Let $L \in \mathbb R$.


$f \left(   \right)x$ tends to the limit $L$ as $x$ tends to $c$  if and only if :
:$\forall \epsilon \in \mathbb R_{>0}: \exists \delta \in \mathbb R_{>0}: x \in N_\delta \left(   \right)c \setminus \left\lbrace c \right\rbrace \implies f \left(   \right)x \in N_\epsilon \left(   \right)L$
where:
:$N_\epsilon \left(   \right)L$ denotes the $\epsilon$-neighborhood of $L$
:$N_\delta \left(   \right)c \setminus \left\lbrace c \right\rbrace$ denotes the deleted $\delta$-neighborhood of $c$
:$\mathbb R_{>0}$ denotes the set of strictly positive real numbers.


That is:
:For every (strictly) positive real number $\epsilon$, there exists a (strictly) positive real number $\delta$ such that every real number $x \ne c$ in the domain of $f$ within $\delta$ of $c$ has an image within $\epsilon$ of $L$.


$\epsilon$ is usually considered as having the connotation of being ""small"" in magnitude, but this is a misunderstanding of its intent: the point is that (in this context) $\epsilon$ can be made arbitrarily small.

Definition:Limit,Limit,"The definition for the limit of a complex function is exactly the same as that for the general metric space.


Let $A_1, A_2 \subseteq \mathbb C$ be subsets of the complex plane.

Let $c$ be a limit point of $A_1$.

Let $f: A_1 \to A_2$ be a complex function from $A_1$ to $A_2$ defined everywhere on $A_1$ except possibly at $c$.


Let $L \in A_2$.


Then $f \left(   \right)z$ is said to tend to the limit $L$ as $z$ tends to $c$, and we write:
:$f \left(   \right)z \to L$ as $z \to c$

That is, for every real positive $\epsilon$ there exists a real positive $\delta$ such that every point in the domain of $f$ within $\delta$ of $c$ has an image within $\epsilon$ of some point $L$ in the codomain of $f$.

where:
:$N_\delta \left(   \right)c \setminus \left\lbrace c \right\rbrace$ is the deleted $\delta $-neighborhood of $c$ in $M_1$;
:$N_\epsilon \left(   \right)L$ is the $\epsilon$-neighborhood of $L$ in $M_2$.

Category:Definitions/Abstract Machines",Definition:Finite State Machine,['Definitions/Abstract Machines']
Definition:Machine,Machine,"An unlimited register machine, abbreviated URM, is an abstract machine with the following characteristics:


=== Registers ===
A URM has a sequence of registers which can store natural numbers: $\left\lbrace 0, 1, 2, \ldots \right\rbrace$.

Any given URM program may make use of only a finite number of these registers.


Registers are usually referred to by the subscripted uppercase letters $R_1, R_2, R_3, \ldots$.

The number held at any one time by a register is usually referred to by the corresponding lowercase letter $r_1, r_2, r_3, \ldots$.


The registers are unlimited in the following two senses:
:$(1): \quad$ Although a URM program may make use of only a finite number of registers, there is no actual upper bound on how many a particular URM program can actually use.
:$(2): \quad$ There is no upper bound on the size of the natural numbers that may be stored in any register.


=== Index of Register ===
The subscript (which is a natural number) appended to a URM register is called the index of that register.

Hence, for example, the index of register $R_5$ is $5$.

=== Program ===
The numbers held in the registers of a URM are manipulated according to a program.

A URM program is a finite sequence of basic instructions.


=== Basic Instruction ===
The basic instructions of a URM program form a finite sequence and hence can be considered a set indexed by the (positive) integer $1, 2, 3, \ldots$.


The basic instructions are as follows:


Name     	Notation          	Effect                     	Description
Zero     	$Z \left(   \right)n$        	$0 \to R_n$                	Replace the number in $R_n$ by $0$.
Successor	$S \left(   \right)n$        	$r_n + 1 \to R_n$          	Add $1$ to the number in $R_n$.
Copy     	$C \left(   \right){m, n}$   	$r_m \to R_n$              	Replace the number in $R_n$ by the number in $R_m$ (leaving the one in $R_m$ as it was).
Jump     	$J \left(   \right){m, n, q}$	$r_m = r_n ? \Rightarrow q$	If the numbers in $R_m$ and $R_n$ are equal, go to instruction number $q$, otherwise go to the next instruction.



=== Execution ===
The operation of carrying out a basic URM instruction is referred to as execution.

=== Execution ===
The operation of carrying out a basic URM instruction is referred to as execution.

=== Line Number ===
For historical reasons, the index of an instruction in a given URM program is called its line number.

We can refer either to the line of the program or the line in the URM.

=== Set of All URM Programs ===
It is convenient to use $\Bbb U$ to stand for the set of all URM programs.

=== Length of Program ===
Let $\Bbb U$ denote the set of all URM programs.

Let $P \in \Bbb U$ be a URM program.

By definition, $P$ is a finite sequence of basic instructions.


We define the function $\lambda: \Bbb U \to \mathbb N$ as follows:
:$\forall P \in \Bbb U: \lambda \left(   \right)P = $ the number of basic instructions that comprise $P$

Thus $\lambda \left(   \right)P$ is referred to as the length of $P$.

Let $\Bbb U$ denote the set of all URM programs.

Let $P \in \Bbb U$ be a URM program.

By definition, $P$ uses a finite number of registers.


We define the function $\rho: \Bbb U \to \mathbb N$ as follows:
:$\forall P \in \Bbb U: \rho \left(   \right)P =$ the highest register number used by $P$

That is, in any URM program $P$, no instruction refers to any register with index greater than $\rho \left(   \right)P$.

That is, in any URM program $P$, no instruction refers to any register with index greater than $\rho \left(   \right)P$.

=== Termination ===
A URM program terminates when there are no more instructions to execute.

This can happen in either of two ways:
:$(1): \quad$ If the program executes the last instruction, and this does not involve a Jump to an earlier instruction, the program will stop.
:$(2): \quad$ If the program executes a Jump instruction to a non-existent instruction, the program will stop.


=== Exit Jump ===
 

Such a Jump instruction is known as an exit jump .

=== Exit Line ===
 

The line on which a particular run of a URM program stops is called the exit line.


=== Endless Loop ===
 

If a URM program, when running, never reaches a state where it terminates, then it is said to be in an endless loop and will never terminate.

 

Note that whether a program terminates or not may depend on its input.

It may terminate perfectly well for one input, but go into an endless loop on another.

=== Input ===

The input to a URM program is:
:either an ordered $k$-tuple $\left( n_1, n_2, \ldots, n_k \right) \in \mathbb N^k$
:or a natural number $n \in \mathbb N$.


In the latter case, it is convenient to consider a single natural number as an ordered $1$-tuple $\left( n_1 \right) \in \mathbb N^1 = \mathbb N$.

Hence we can discuss inputs to URM programs solely as instances of tuples, and not be concerned with cumbersome repetition for the cases where $k = 1$ and otherwise.


The convention usually used is for a URM program $P$ to start computation with:
:the input $\left({n_1, n_2, \ldots, n_k}\right)$ in registers $R_1, R_2, \ldots, R_k$
:$0$ in all other registers used by $P$.


That is, the initial state of the URM is:
:$\forall i \in \left[ 1 \,.\,.\,   \right]k: r_i = n_i$
:$\forall i > k: r_i = 0$.


It is usual for the input (either all or part) to be overwritten during the course of the operation of a program. That is, at the end of a program, $R_1, R_2, \ldots, R_k$ are not guaranteed still to contain $n_1, n_2, \ldots, n_k$ unless the program has been explicitly written so as to ensure that this is the case.


=== Output ===

At the end of the running of a URM program, the output will be found in register $R_1$.

=== Operation ===
When a URM runs a program, it always starts by executing the first instruction of the program.

When it has executed an instruction, it moves to the next instruction and executes that one, unless required otherwise by a Jump instruction.


=== Execution ===
The operation of carrying out a basic URM instruction is referred to as execution.

=== Instruction Pointer ===
The line number of the instruction which is currently about to be executed is known as the instruction pointer.

It can be imagined as a special-purpose register in the URM whose purpose is to hold that line number.

=== Stage of Computation ===
The stage of computation (or just stage) of a URM program is the count of how many instructions have been executed.

Thus each stage corresponds to the processing of one instruction.

=== State ===
The state of a URM program at a particular stage is defined as:
:$(1): \quad$ the value of the instruction pointer
:$(2): \quad$ the values contained by each of the registers that are used by the URM program.

:$\forall i \in \left[ 1 \,.\,.\,   \right]k: r_i = n_i$

=== Output ===

At the end of the running of a URM program, the output will be found in register $R_1$.


=== Null Program ===
The null URM program is a URM program which contains no instructions.

That is, a URM program whose length is zero.",Definition:Unlimited Register Machine,"['Definitions/Examples of Abstract Machines', 'Definitions/Unlimited Register Machines']"
Definition:Machine,Machine,"A Turing machine is an abstract machine which works by manipulating symbols on an imaginary piece of paper by means of a specific set of algorithmic rules.

To simplify things, the piece of paper being worked on is in the form of a series of boxes on a one-dimensional ""tape"" divided into squares.

Each square can be either blank or can contain a symbol taken from a finite set, e.g. $s_1, s_2, \ldots, s_\alpha$.


The machine examines one square at a time, and carries out an action determined by both:
:$(1): \quad$ the symbol in the square
:$(2): \quad$ the current internal state of the machine.

The internal state of the machine is a way of providing a device that can keep track of the symbols in other squares.

There can be only a finite set of these states, say $q_1, q_2, \ldots, q_\beta$.


The actions that the machine can take are as follows:
:$(1): \quad$ Replace the symbol in the square with another symbol
:$(2): \quad$ Move to examine the square in the immediate left of the current square being looked at
:$(3): \quad$ Move to examine the square in the immediate right of the current square being looked at.

After carrying out an action, the machine may change to a different internal state.


The program for the machine is a set of instructions which specify:
:$(1): \quad$ what action to take in some possible combinations of the internal state and symbol in the square currently being read
:$(2): \quad$ which internal state the machine moves into after carrying out that action.

Thus the instructions have the following form:
:$q_i \quad s_j \quad A \quad q_t$
which is interpreted as:

""If:
:* the machine is in internal state $q_i$
: the symbol in the square currently being examined is $s_j$
then:
: Carry out action $A$
: Move into internal state $q_t$.


The actions can be abbreviated to:
: $L$: Move one square to the left
: $R$: Move one square to the right
: $s_k$: Replace the symbol in the square currently being read with symbol $s_k$.


The computation stops when there is no instruction which specifies what should be done in the current combination of internal state and symbol being read.

=== Formal Definition ===
 

A Turing machine is a 7-tuple $\left( Q, \unicode{x3a3}, \Gamma, \delta, q_0, B, F \right)$ that satisfies the following:
* $Q$ is a finite set, the states of the machine.
* $\unicode{x3a3}$ is a finite set, the input symbols.
* $\Gamma \supsetneq \unicode{x3a3}$ is a finite superset of the input symbols, called the tape symbols.
** For convenience, we also require that $\Gamma$ and $Q$ are disjoint.
* $\delta : Q \times \Gamma \to Q \times \Gamma \times \left\lbrace L, R \right\rbrace$ is a partial mapping, the transition function.
** $L$ and $R$ are arbitrary constants called directions.
* $q_0 \in Q$ is a distinguished state called the start state.
* $B \in \Gamma$ is a distinguished tape symbol called the blank symbol. $B$ must not be an element of $\unicode{x3a3}$.
* $F \subset Q$ be a designated subset of the states called accepting states.


An instantaneous description of a Turing machine is a finite sequence of elements of $\Gamma \cup Q$, subject to the following conditions:
* There is exactly one element of $Q$ in the sequence.
* The first entry in the sequence is not $B$.
* The last entry in the sequence is not in $Q$.
* If the last entry in the sequence is $B$, then the second-to-last is in $Q$.

By this definition, an instantaneous description can always be written as:
:$X_m X_{m-1} \dotsm X_2 X_1 q Y Z_1 Z_2 \dotsm Z_{n-1} Z_n$
where $m$ or $n$ may be $0$; $X_i$, $Y$, and $Z_j$ are all elements of $\Gamma$; and $q$ is an element of $Q$.

Additionally, $X_m$ and $Z_n$ are not $B$ if they exist; that is, if $m$ and $n$ are not $0$, respectively.


A move reduces one instantaneous description into another by applying the transition function.

We write $A \vdash B$ if a machine with instantaneous description $A$ has, after a single move, instantaneous description $B$.

Let $\delta \left(   \right){q, Y} = \left( q', Y', d \right)$.

Then there are seven cases to consider:

* If $d = L$ and $m > 0$, and either $n > 0$ or $Y' \neq B$ then:
:$X_m \dotsm X_2 X_1 q Y Z_1 \dotsm Z_n \vdash X_m \dotsm X_2 q' X_1 Y' Z_1 \dotsm Z_n$

* If $d = L$ and $m > 0$, but $n = 0$ and $Y' = B$ then:
:$X_m \dotsm X_2 X_1 q Y \vdash X_m \dotsm X_2 q' X_1$

* If $d = L$ but $m = 0$, and either $n > 0$ or $Y' \neq B$ then:
:$q Y Z_1 \dotsm Z_n \vdash q' B Y' Z_1 \dotsm Z_n$

* If $d = R$ and $n > 0$, and either $m > 0$ or $Y' \neq B$ then:
:$X_m \dotsm X_1 q Y Z_1 Z_2 \dotsm Z_n \vdash X_m \dotsm X_1 Y' q' Z_1 Z_2 \dotsm Z_n$

* If $d = R$ and $n > 0$, but $m = 0$ and $Y' = B$ then:
:$q Y Z_1 Z_2 \dotsm Z_n \vdash q' Z_1 Z_2 \dotsm Z_n$

* If $d = R$ but $n = 0$, and either $m > 0$ or $Y' \neq B$ then:
:$X_m \dotsm X_1 q Y \vdash X_m \dotsm X_1 Y' q' B$

* If $m = 0$, $n = 0$, and $Y' = B$ then regardless of $d$:
:$q Y \vdash q' B$


Let $A \vdash^* B$ indicate that there exists a finite sequence $\left\langle A_i \right\rangle_{0 \leq i \leq n}$ such that:
:$A = A_0 \vdash A_1 \vdash A_2 \vdash \dotso \vdash A_n = B$


The language $L \left(   \right)M$ accepted by the machine $M$ is the set of strings $w \in \unicode{x3a3}^*$ for which, for some $\alpha, \beta \in \Gamma^*$ and $p \in F$:
:$q_0 w \vdash^* \alpha p \beta$

As a special case, the null string is in the language  if and only if  the above holds for $w = B$.


A machine $M$ halts on an input $w$, using the same special case for the null string as above,  if and only if  for some $\alpha, \beta \in \Gamma^*$, $X \in \Gamma$, and $q \in Q$:
:$q_0 w \vdash^* \alpha q X \beta$
where $\delta \left(   \right){q, X}$ is undefined.",Definition:Turing Machine,"['Definitions/Turing Machines', 'Definitions/Examples of Abstract Machines']"
Definition:Machine,Machine,"A Nondeterministic (or Non-deterministic) Turing Machine (NTM) is a variation of the classical Turing machine that relaxes the restriction that all the steps in the machine must be definite.

That is, given a single internal state and a single character being read on the tape the machine may have more than one possible response.

If any sequence of choices puts the machine into a halting state, then the machine stops after $n$ steps, where $n$ is the minimum number of steps needed to put the machine into a halting state.

 

=== Formal Definition ===

A nondeterministic Turing machine is a 7-tuple $\left( Q, \unicode{x3a3}, \Gamma, \delta, q_0, B, F \right)$ that satisfies the following:
* $Q$ is a finite set, the states of the machine.
* $\unicode{x3a3}$ is a finite set, the input symbols.
* $\Gamma \supsetneq \unicode{x3a3}$ is a finite superset of the input symbols, called the tape symbols.
** For convenience, we also require that $\Gamma$ and $Q$ are disjoint.
* $\delta : Q \times \Gamma \to \mathcal P \left( Q \times \Gamma \times \left\lbrace L, R \right\rbrace  \right)$ is a mapping, the transition function.
** $L$ and $R$ are arbitrary constants called directions.
* $q_0 \in Q$ is a distinguished state called the start state.
* $B \in \Gamma$ is a distinguished tape symbol called the blank symbol. $B$ must not be an element of $\unicode{x3a3}$.
* $F \subset Q$ be a designated subset of the states called accepting states.


An instantaneous description of a nondeterministic Turing machine is a finite sequence of elements of $\Gamma \cup Q$, subject to the following conditions:
* There is exactly one element of $Q$ in the sequence.
* The first entry in the sequence is not $B$.
* The last entry in the sequence is not in $Q$.
* If the last entry in the sequence is $B$, then the second-to-last is in $Q$.

By this definition, an instantaneous description can always be written as:
:$X_m X_{m-1} \dotsm X_2 X_1 q Y Z_1 Z_2 \dotsm Z_{n-1} Z_n$
where $m$ or $n$ may be $0$; $X_i$, $Y$, and $Z_j$ are all elements of $\Gamma$; and $q$ is an element of $Q$.

Additionally, $X_m$ and $Z_n$ are not $B$ if they exist; that is, if $m$ and $n$ are not $0$, respectively.


A move reduces one instantaneous description into another by applying the transition function. There may be many possible moves from any given instantaneous description.

We write $A \vdash B$ if a machine with instantaneous description $A$ may have, after a single move, instantaneous description $B$.

Let $\left( q', Y', d \right) \in \delta \left(   \right){q, Y}$.

* If $d = R$ but $n = 0$, and either $m > 0$ or $Y' \neq B$ then:
:$X_m \dotsm X_1 q Y \vdash X_m \dotsm X_1 Y' q' B$

Let $x \in \mathbb R$ be a real number such that $x > 0$.

Let $m \in \mathbb Z$ be an integer.

Let $y = \sqrt [m] x$ be the $m$th root of $x$.


Then we can write $y = x^{1/m}$ which means the same thing as $y = \sqrt [m] x$.


Thus we can define the power to a positive rational number:

Let $r = \dfrac p q \in \mathbb Q$ be a positive rational number where $p \in \mathbb Z_{\ge 0}, q \in \mathbb Z_{> 0}$.

Then $x^r$ is defined as:
:$x^r = x^{p/q} = \left( \sqrt [q] x \right)^p = \sqrt [q] {\left( x^p \right) }$


When $r = \dfrac {-p} q \in \mathbb Q: r < 0$ we define:
:$x^r = x^{-p/q} = \dfrac 1 {x^{p/q} }$
analogously for the negative integer definition.

=== Real Numbers ===

Let $r \in \mathbb R$ be a real number.


We define $x^r$ as:

:$x^r := \exp \left(   \right){r \ln x}$
where $\exp$ denotes the exponential function.


This definition is an extension of the definition for rational $r$.

This follows from Logarithms of Powers and Exponential of Natural Logarithm: it can be seen that:

:$\ln$ is the  natural logarithm multifunction.

:$S \times T = \left\lbrace \left( x, y \right): x \in S \land y \in T \right\rbrace$


Another way of defining it is by:

:$\left( x, y \right) \in S \times T \iff x \in S, y \in T$

More specifically:
:$\forall p: \left( p \in S \times T \iff \exists x: \exists y: x \in S \land y \in T \land p = \left( x, y \right)  \right)$


$S \times T$ can be voiced $S$ cross $T$.


=== Class Theory ===
Let $A$ and $B$ be classes.


The cartesian product $A \times B$ of $A$ and $B$ is the class of ordered pairs $\left( x, y \right)$ with $x \in A$ and $y \in B$:

:$A \times B = \left\lbrace \left( x, y \right): x \in A \land y \in B \right\rbrace$


Thus:
:$\forall p: \left( p \in A \times B \iff \exists x: \exists y: x \in A \land y \in B \land p = \left( x, y \right)  \right)$


$A \times B$ can be voiced $A$ cross $B$.

=== Finite Cartesian Product ===
Let $\left\langle S_n \right\rangle$ be a sequence of sets. 

The (finite) cartesian product of $\left\langle S_n \right\rangle$ is defined as:

:$\ds \prod_{k \mathop = 1}^n S_k = \left\lbrace \left( x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_n \right): \forall k \in \mathbb N^*_n: x_k \in S_k \right\rbrace$


It is also denoted $S_1 \times S_2 \times \cdots \times S_n$.

Thus $S_1 \times S_2 \times \cdots \times S_n$ is the set of all ordered $n$-tuples $\left( x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_n \right)$ with $x_k \in S_k$.


In particular:
:$\ds \prod_{k \mathop = 1}^2 S_k = S_1 \times S_2$

=== Countable Cartesian Product ===

The same notation can be used to define the (countable) cartesian product of an infinite sequence:

Let $\left\langle S_n \right\rangle_{n \mathop \in \mathbb N}$ be an infinite sequence of sets. 

The cartesian product of $\left\langle S_n \right\rangle$ is defined as:

:$\ds \prod_{k \mathop = 1}^\infty S_k = \left\lbrace \left( x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_n, \ldots \right): \forall k \in \mathbb N: x_k \in S_k \right\rbrace$


It defines the concept:
:$S_1 \times S_2 \times \cdots \times S_n \times \cdots$

Thus $\ds \prod_{k \mathop = 1}^\infty S_k$ is the set of all infinite sequences $\left( x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_n, \ldots \right)$ with $x_k \in S_k$.

=== Family of Sets ===

Let $\left\langle S_i \right\rangle_{i \mathop \in I}$ be a family of sets indexed by $I$.

The Cartesian product of $\left\langle S_i \right\rangle_{i \mathop \in I}$ is the set of all families $\left\langle s_i \right\rangle_{i \mathop \in I}$ with $s_i \in S_i$ for each $i \in I$.


This can be denoted $\ds \prod_{i \mathop \in I} S_i$ or, if $I$ is understood, $\ds \prod_i S_i$.",Definition:Cartesian Product,"['Definitions/Set Theory', 'Definitions/Cartesian Product']"

Definition:Product,Product,"=== Matrix Product (Conventional) ===
Let $\left( R, +, \circ \right)$ be a ring.

Let $\mathbf A = \left[ a \right]_{m n}$ be an $m \times n$ matrix over $R$.

Let $\mathbf B = \left[ b \right]_{n p}$ be an $n \times p$ matrix over $R$.

Then the matrix product of $\mathbf A$ and $\mathbf B$ is written $\mathbf A \mathbf B$ and is defined as follows.

Let $\mathbf A \mathbf B = \mathbf C = \left[ c \right]_{m p}$.


Then:
:$\ds \forall i \in \left[ 1 \,.\,.\,   \right]m, j \in \left[ 1 \,.\,.\,   \right]p: c_{i j} = \sum_{k \mathop = 1}^n a_{i k} \circ b_{k j}$


Thus $\left[ c \right]_{m p}$ is the $m \times p$ matrix where each entry $c_{i j}$ is built by forming the (ring) product of each entry in the $i$'th row of $\mathbf A$ with the corresponding entry in the $j$'th column of $\mathbf B$ and adding up all those products.


This operation is called matrix multiplication, and $\mathbf C$ is the matrix product of $\mathbf A$ with $\mathbf B$.


It follows that matrix multiplication is defined whenever the first matrix has the same number of columns as the second matrix has rows.


=== Pre-Multiplication ===
Let $\left( R, +, \circ \right)$ be a ring.

Let $\mathbf A = \left[ a \right]_{m n}$ be an $m \times n$ matrix over $R$.

Let $\mathbf B = \left[ b \right]_{n p}$ be an $n \times p$ matrix over $R$.


Let $\mathbf A \mathbf B$ be the product of $\mathbf A$ with $\mathbf B$.

Then $\mathbf B$ is pre-multiplied by $\mathbf A$.

=== Post-Multiplication ===
Let $\left( R, +, \circ \right)$ be a ring.

Let $\mathbf A = \left[ a \right]_{m n}$ be an $m \times n$ matrix over $R$.

Let $\mathbf B = \left[ b \right]_{n p}$ be an $n \times p$ matrix over $R$.


Let $\mathbf A \mathbf B$ be the product of $\mathbf A$ with $\mathbf B$.

Then $\mathbf A$ is post-multiplied by $\mathbf B$.

=== Using Einstein Summation Convention ===
Let $\left( R, +, \circ \right)$ be a ring.

Let $\mathbf A = \left[ a \right]_{m n}$ be an $m \times n$ matrix over $R$.

Let $\mathbf B = \left[ b \right]_{n p}$ be an $n \times p$ matrix over $R$.


The matrix product of $\mathbf A$ and $\mathbf B$ can be expressed using the Einstein summation convention as:

Then:
:$c_{i j} := a_{i k} \circ b_{k j}$


The index which appears twice in the expressions on the   is the entry $k$, which is the one summated over.

=== Conformable Matrices ===
Let $\mathbf A$ and $\mathbf B$ be matrices.

It needs to be emphasised that matrix product can be defined on $\mathbf A$ and $\mathbf B$  if and only if  $\mathbf A$ and $\mathbf B$ are conformable.


That is, if the number of rows of one is equal to the number of columns of the other.

=== Matrix Scalar Product ===
Let $\mathbb F$ denote one of the standard number systems.

Let $\mathcal M \left(   \right){m, n}$ be the $m \times n$ matrix space over $\mathbb F$.

Let $\mathbf A = \left[ a \right]_{m n} \in \mathcal M \left(   \right){m, n}$.

Let $\lambda \in \mathbb F$ be any element of $\Bbb F$.


The operation of scalar multiplication of $\mathbf A$ by $\lambda$ is defined as follows.

Let $\lambda \mathbf A = \mathbf C$.

Then:
:$\forall i \in \left[ 1 \,.\,.\,   \right]m, j \in \left[ 1 \,.\,.\,   \right]n: c_{i j} = \lambda a_{i j}$

$\lambda \mathbf A$ is the scalar product of $\lambda$ and $\mathbf A$.


Thus $\mathbf C = \left[ c \right]_{m n}$ is the $m \times n$ matrix composed of the product of $\lambda$ with the corresponding elements of $\mathbf A$.


=== Ring ===
Let $\left( R, +, \circ \right)$ be a ring.

Let $\mathbf A = \left[ a \right]_{m n}$ be an $m \times n$ matrix over $\left( R, +, \circ \right)$.

Let $\lambda \in R$ be any element of $R$.


The scalar product of $\lambda$ and $\mathbf A$ is defined as follows.

Let $\lambda \circ \mathbf A = \mathbf C$.

Then:
:$\forall i \in \left[ 1 \,.\,.\,   \right]m, j \in \left[ 1 \,.\,.\,   \right]n: c_{i j} = \lambda \circ a_{i j}$


Thus $\left[ c \right]_{m n}$ is the $m \times n$ matrix composed of the product of $\lambda$ with the corresponding elements of $\mathbf A$.


=== Scalar ===
Let $\mathcal M \left(   \right){m, n}$ be a matrix space of order $m \times n$ on which scalar multiplication is defined.

Let $\mathbf A = \left[ a \right]_{m n} \in \mathcal M \left(   \right){m, n}$.


Let $\lambda$ be an element of the underlying structure such that:

:$\mathbf C = \lambda \mathbf A$

where the notation denotes scalar multiplication.


The element $\lambda$ of the underlying structure of $\mathcal M \left(   \right){m, n}$ is known as a scalar.

=== Commutative Matrix Product ===
 

=== Kronecker Product ===

Also known as matrix direct product:

Let $\mathbf A = \left[ a \right]_{m n}$ and $\mathbf B = \left[ b \right]_{p q}$ be matrices.

The Kronecker product of $\mathbf A$ and $\mathbf B$ is denoted $\mathbf A \otimes \mathbf B$ and is defined as the block matrix:

:$\mathbf A \otimes \mathbf B = \begin{bmatrix}
a_{11} \mathbf B & a_{12} \mathbf B & \cdots & a_{1n} \mathbf B \\
a_{21} \mathbf B & a_{22} \mathbf B & \cdots & a_{2n} \mathbf B \\
\vdots & \vdots & \ddots & \vdots \\
a_{m1} \mathbf B & a_{m2} \mathbf B & \cdots & a_{mn} \mathbf B
\end{bmatrix}$


Writing this out in full:

:$\mathbf A \otimes \mathbf B = \begin{bmatrix}
a_{11} b_{11} & a_{11} b_{12} & \cdots & a_{11} b_{1q} & \cdots & \cdots & a_{1n} b_{11} & a_{1n} b_{12} & \cdots & a_{1n} b_{1q} \\
a_{11} b_{21} & a_{11} b_{22} & \cdots & a_{11} b_{2q} & \cdots & \cdots & a_{1n} b_{21} & a_{1n} b_{22} & \cdots & a_{1n} b_{2q} \\
\vdots & \vdots & \ddots & \vdots & & & \vdots & \vdots & \ddots & \vdots \\
a_{11} b_{p1} & a_{11} b_{p2} & \cdots & a_{11} b_{pq} & \cdots & \cdots & a_{1n} b_{p1} & a_{1n} b_{p2} & \cdots & a_{1n} b_{pq} \\
\vdots & \vdots & & \vdots & \ddots & & \vdots & \vdots & & \vdots \\
\vdots & \vdots & & \vdots & & \ddots & \vdots & \vdots & & \vdots \\
a_{m1} b_{11} & a_{m1} b_{12} & \cdots & a_{m1} b_{1q} & \cdots & \cdots & a_{mn} b_{11} & a_{mn} b_{12} & \cdots & a_{mn} b_{1q} \\
a_{m1} b_{21} & a_{m1} b_{22} & \cdots & a_{m1} b_{2q} & \cdots & \cdots & a_{mn} b_{21} & a_{mn} b_{22} & \cdots & a_{mn} b_{2q} \\
\vdots & \vdots & \ddots & \vdots & & & \vdots & \vdots & \ddots & \vdots \\
a_{m1} b_{p1} & a_{m1} b_{p2} & \cdots & a_{m1} b_{pq} & \cdots & \cdots & a_{mn} b_{p1} & a_{mn} b_{p2} & \cdots & a_{mn} b_{pq} 
\end{bmatrix}$


Thus, if:
:$\mathbf A$ is a matrix with order $m \times n$
:$\mathbf B$ is a matrix with order $p \times q$

then $\mathbf A \otimes \mathbf B$ is a matrix with order $m p \times n q$.

=== Hadamard Product ===

Also known as Matrix Entrywise Product or Schur Product:

Let $\mathbf A = \left[ a \right]_{m n}$ and $\mathbf B = \left[ b \right]_{m n}$ be $m \times n$ matrices over a ring $\left( R, +, \times \right)$.


The Hadamard product of $\mathbf A$ and $\mathbf B$ is written $\mathbf A \circ \mathbf B$ and is defined as follows:

:$\mathbf A \circ \mathbf B := \mathbf C = \left[ c \right]_{m n}$

where:

:$\forall i \in \left[ 1 \,.\,.\,   \right]m, j \in \left[ 1 \,.\,.\,   \right]n: c_{i j} = a_{i j} \times b_{i j}$

Let $O$ be a distinguished point in $\Gamma$, which has the property that:
:$r_\alpha \left(   \right)O = O$

:$(2): \quad \angle POP' = \theta$ such that $OP \to OP'$ is in the anticlockwise direction:

:the length of $\mathbf r_\theta$ specifies its angle of rotation of $\mathbf r_\theta$ to an appropriate scale.

In the above right triangle, we are concerned about the angle $\theta$.

The secant of $\angle \theta$ is defined as being $\dfrac{\text{Hypotenuse}} {\text{Adjacent}}$.

=== Definition from Circle ===
=== First Quadrant ===
Consider a unit circle $C$ whose center is at the origin of a cartesian plane.


:


Let $P$ be the point on $C$ in the first quadrant such that $\theta$ is the angle made by $OP$ with the $x$-axis.

Let a tangent line be drawn to touch $C$ at $A = \left( 1, 0 \right)$.

Let $OP$ be produced to meet this tangent line at $B$.


Then the secant of $\theta$ is defined as the length of $OB$.

Hence in the first quadrant, the secant is positive.

=== Second Quadrant ===
Consider a unit circle $C$ whose center is at the origin of a cartesian plane.


:


Let $P$ be the point on $C$ in the second quadrant such that $\theta$ is the angle made by $OP$ with the $x$-axis.

Let a tangent line be drawn to touch $C$ at $A = \left( 1, 0 \right)$.

Let $OP$ be produced to meet this tangent line at $B$.


Then the secant of $\theta$ is defined as the length of $OB$.

As $OP$ needs to be produced in the opposite direction to $P$, the secant is therefore a negative function in the second quadrant.

=== Third Quadrant ===
Consider a unit circle $C$ whose center is at the origin of a cartesian plane.


:


Let $P$ be the point on $C$ in the third quadrant such that $\theta$ is the angle made by $OP$ with the $x$-axis.

Let a tangent line be drawn to touch $C$ at $A = \left( 1, 0 \right)$.

Let $OP$ be produced to meet this tangent line at $B$.


Then the secant of $\theta$ is defined as the length of $OB$.


As $OP$ needs to be produced in the opposite direction to $P$, the secant is therefore a negative function in the third quadrant.

=== Fourth Quadrant ===
Consider a unit circle $C$ whose center is at the origin of a cartesian plane.


:


Let $P$ be the point on $C$ in the fourth quadrant such that $\theta$ is the angle made by $OP$ with the $x$-axis.

Let a tangent line be drawn to touch $C$ at $A = \left( 1, 0 \right)$.

Let $OP$ be produced to meet this tangent line at $B$.


Then the secant of $\theta$ is defined as the length of $OB$.

Hence in the fourth quadrant, the secant is positive.

The Cartesian plane is a Cartesian coordinate system of $2$ dimensions.

Identify one distinct point on the plane as the origin $O$.

Select a point $P$ on the plane different from $O$.

Construct an infinite straight line through $O$ and $P$ and call it the $x$-axis.


Identify the $x$-axis with the real number line such that:
:$0$ is identified with the origin $O$
:$1$ is identified with the point $P$

The orientation of the $x$-axis is determined by the relative positions of $O$ and $P$.

It is conventional to locate $P$ to the right of $O$, so as to arrange that:

:to the right of the origin, the numbers on the $x$-axis are positive
:to the left of the origin, the numbers on the $x$-axis are negative.


Construct an infinite straight line through $O$ perpendicular to the $x$-axis and call it the $y$-axis.

Identify the point $P'$ on the $y$-axis such that $OP' = OP$.

Identify the $y$-axis with the real number line such that:
:$0$ is identified with the origin $O$
:$1$ is identified with the point $P'$


The orientation of the $y$-axis is determined by the position of $P'$ relative to $O$.

It is conventional to locate $P'$ such that, if one were to imagine being positioned at $O$ and facing along the $x$-axis towards $P$, then $P'$ is on the left. 

Hence with the conventional orientation of the $x$-axis as horizontal and increasing to the right:

:going vertically ""up"" the page or screen from the origin, the numbers on the $y$-axis are positive
:going vertically ""down"" the page or screen from the origin, the numbers on the $y$-axis are negative.

Let $x$ be the length of the line segment from the origin $O$ to the foot of the perpendicular from $Q$ to the $x$-axis.

Then $x$ is known as the $x$ coordinate.

If $Q$ is in the positive direction along the real number line that is the $x$-axis, then $x$ is positive.

If $Q$ is in the negative direction along the real number line that is the $x$-axis, then $x$ is negative.

=== $y$ Coordinate ===
Consider a Cartesian coordinate system $C$ with a $y$-axis.

Let a point $Q$ be positioned in $C$.


Let $y$ be the length of the line segment from the origin $O$ to the foot of the perpendicular from $Q$ to the $y$-axis.

Then $y$ is known as the $y$ coordinate.

If $Q$ is in the positive direction along the real number line that is the $y$-axis, then $y$ is positive.

If $Q$ is in the negative direction along the real number line that is the $y$-axis, then $y$ is negative.

$n = 3$ is another special case:

Let $S$ be a set.

Recall the identification of the point $P$ with the coordinate pair $\left( 1, 0 \right)$ in the $x$-$y$ plane.


Construct an infinite straight line through $O$ perpendicular to both the $x$-axis and the$y$-axis and call it the $z$-axis.

Identify the point $P' '$ on the $z$-axis such that $OP' ' = OP$.

Every point in ordinary $3$-space can be identified uniquely by means of an ordered triple of real coordinates  $\left( x, y, z \right)$, as follows:

Construct a Cartesian plane, with origin $O$ and axes identified as the $x$-axis and $y$-axis.

Recall the identification of the point $P$ with the coordinate pair $\left( 1, 0 \right)$ in the $x$-$y$ plane.


Construct an infinite straight line through $O$ perpendicular to both the $x$-axis and the$y$-axis and call it the $z$-axis.

Identify the point $P' '$ on the $z$-axis such that $OP' ' = OP$.

Identify the $z$-axis with the real number line such that:
:$0$ is identified with the origin $O$
:$1$ is identified with the point $P$


=== Orientation ===


Consider a Cartesian $3$-Space.

Let the $x$-axis, $y$-axis and $z$-axis be defined.


Let a point $P$ be identified on the $x$-axis, different from $O$, with the coordinate pair $\left( 1, 0 \right)$ in the $x$-$y$ plane.

Let the point $P'$ be identified on the $y$-axis such that $OP' = OP$.


It remains to identify the point $P'  '$ on the $z$-axis such that $OP' ' = OP$.

=== Cartesian Coordinate Triple ===


=== Definition by Planes ===


Every point in ordinary $3$-space can be identified uniquely by means of an ordered triple of real coordinates  $\left( x, y, z \right)$, as follows:

Identify one distinct point in space as the origin $O$.

Let $3$ distinct planes be constructed through $O$ such that all are perpendicular.

Each pair of these $3$ planes intersect in a straight line that passes through $O$.

Let $X$, $Y$ and $Z$ be points, other than $O$, one on each of these $3$ lines of intersection.


Then the lines $OX$, $OY$ and $OZ$ are named the $x$-axis, $y$-axis and $z$-axis respectively.


Select a point $P$ on the $x$-axis different from $O$.

Let $P$ be identified with the coordinate pair $\left( 1, 0 \right)$ in the $x$-$y$ plane.

Identify the point $P'$ on the $y$-axis such that $OP' = OP$.

Identify the point $P' '$ on the $z$-axis such that $OP' ' = OP$.

The Cartesian $3$-Space is defined as right-handed when $P' '$ is located as follows.

Let the coordinate axes be oriented as follows:

Imagine being positioned, standing on the $x$-$y$ plane at $O$, and facing along the $x$-axis towards $P$, with $P'$ on the left. 

Then $P' '$ is then one unit above the $x$-$y$ plane.


Hence, let the coordinate axes be oriented as follows:

:Let the $x$-axis increase from West to East.
:Let the $y$-axis increase from South to North.

Then the $z$-axis increases from below to above.

:the $x$-axis increases from left to right.
:the $y$-axis increases from bottom to top.

Then the $z$-axis increases from behind to in front (that is, from further away to closer in).

The summation of $\left( a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n \right)$ can be written:
:$\ds \sum_{1 \mathop \le j \mathop \le n} a_j = \left( a_1 + a_2 + \cdots + a_n \right)$


=== Multiple Indices ===
Let $\ds \sum_{0 \mathop \le j \mathop \le n} a_j$ denote the summation of $\left( a_0, a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n \right)$.


Summands with multiple indices can be denoted by propositional functions in several variables, for example:

:$\ds \sum_{0 \mathop \le i \mathop \le n} \left( \sum_{0 \mathop \le j \mathop \le n} a_{i j}  \right) = \sum_{0 \mathop \le i, j \mathop \le n} a_{i j}$


:$\ds \sum_{0 \mathop \le i \mathop \le n} \left( \sum_{0 \mathop \le j \mathop \le i} a_{i j}  \right) = \sum_{0 \mathop \le j \mathop \le i \mathop \le n} a_{i j}$

=== Definition by Propositional Function ===
Let $\left( S, + \right)$ be an algebraic structure where the operation $+$ is an operation derived from, or arising from, the addition operation on the natural numbers.

Let $\left( a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n \right) \in S^n$ be an ordered $n$-tuple in $S$.


Let $R \left(   \right)j$ be a propositional function of $j$.

Then we can write the summation as:

:$\ds \sum_{R \left(   \right)j} a_j = \text{ The sum of all $a_j$ such that $R \left(   \right)j$ holds}$.


If more than one propositional function is written under the summation sign, they must all hold.


Such an operation on an ordered tuple is known as a summation.


Note that the definition by inequality form $1 \le j \le n$ is a special case of such a propositional function.

Also note that the definition by index form $\ds \sum_{j \mathop = 1}^n$ is merely another way of writing $\ds \sum_{1 \mathop \le j \mathop \le n}$.

Hence all instances of a summation can be expressed in terms of a propositional function.


=== Iverson's Convention ===
Let $\ds \sum_{R \left(   \right)j} a_j$ be the summation over all $a_j$ such that $j$ satisfies $R$.


This can also be expressed:
:$\ds \sum_{j \mathop \in \mathbb Z} a_j \left[ R \left(   \right)j \right]$
where $\left[ R \left(   \right)j \right]$ is Iverson's convention.

Definition:System,System,"Let $\mathcal L$ be a formal language.


A proof system $\mathscr P$ for $\mathcal L$ comprises:

* Axioms and/or axiom schemata;
* Rules of inference for deriving theorems.


It is usual that a proof system does this by declaring certain arguments concerning $\mathcal L$ to be valid.

Informally, a proof system amounts to a precise account of what constitutes a (formal) proof.


=== Rule of Inference ===
Let $\mathcal L$ be a formal language.

Part of defining a proof system $\mathscr P$ for $\mathcal L$ is to specify its rules of inference.


A rule of inference is a specification of a valid means to conclude new theorems in $\mathscr P$ from given theorems and axioms of $\mathscr P$.

Often, the formulation of rules of inference also appeals to the notion of provable consequence to be able to deal with assumptions as part of a proof.

=== Axiom ===
Let $\mathcal L$ be a formal language.

Part of defining a proof system $\mathscr P$ for $\mathcal L$ is to specify its axioms.


An axiom of $\mathscr P$ is a well-formed formula of $\mathcal L$ that $\mathscr P$ approves of by definition.


=== Axiom Schema ===
Let $\mathcal L$ be a formal language.

Part of defining a proof system $\mathscr P$ for $\mathcal L$ is to specify its axiom schemata.


An axiom schema is a well-formed formula $\phi$ of $\mathcal L$, except for it containing one or more variables which are outside $\mathcal L$ itself.

This formula can then be used to represent an infinite number of individual axioms in one statement.


Namely, each of these variables is allowed to take a specified range of values, most commonly WFFs.

Each WFF $\psi$ that results from $\phi$ by a valid choice of values for all the variables is then an axiom of $\mathscr P$.

=== Formal Proof ===
Let $\mathscr P$ be a proof system for a formal language $\mathcal L$.


Let $\phi$ be a WFF of $\mathcal L$.

A formal proof of $\phi$ in $\mathscr P$ is a collection of axioms and rules of inference of $\mathscr P$ that leads to the conclusion that $\phi$ is a theorem of $\mathscr P$.


The term formal proof is also used to refer to specific presentations of such collections.

For example, the term applies to tableau proofs in natural deduction.",Definition:Proof System,"['Definitions/Formal Systems', 'Definitions/Symbolic Logic', 'Definitions/Proof Systems']"

=== Abstract System ===

A mathematical system $\mathcal S = \left( E, O, A \right)$ is classed as abstract  if and only if  the elements of $E$ and $O$ are defined only by their properties as specified in $A$.

:beginning and ending with a vertex
:in which edge $e_j$ of $W$ is incident with the vertex $v_j$ and the vertex $v_{j + 1}$.


A walk between two vertices $u$ and $v$ is called a $u$-$v$ walk.


To describe a walk on a simple graph it is sufficient to list just the vertices in order, as the edges (being unique between vertices) are unambiguous.
