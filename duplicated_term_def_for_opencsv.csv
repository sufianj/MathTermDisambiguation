Let L_n be the Laplacian matrix of T_n. Then the eigenvalues of L_n are in a natural one-to-one correspondence with the (isomorphism classes of) irreducible representations of S_n; for each irreducible representation ρ, we let μ_ρ denote the corresponding eigenvalue of L. We have
  
    μ_ρ = n  2 - n  2/(ρ)χ_ρ((1  2))

  Furthermore, if α=(α_1,…,α_k) is the

    V = { x ∈^N: P_1(x) = … = P_J(x) = 0 }

where P_1,…,P_J are homogeneous polynomials (resp. polynomials).  A projective (resp. affine) algebraic set is called irreducible if it cannot be written as the union of two proper projective (resp. affine) algebraic subsets, in which case we refer to the algebraic set as a variety .

The dimension of an algebraic set V is the smallest integer d such that intersections of V with generic codimension-d subspaces of ^N or ^N are finite.  If V is a projective variety of dimension d, then generic codimension d subspaces of ^N intersect V in a constant number of points, known as the degree of V.  Every affine variety can be embedded in a unique projective variety of the same dimension (the projective closure of the affine variety); we define the degree of the affine variety to be that of its projective closure.

  The definitions given here are classical in style, and thus subject to certain pathologies; for instance, one might expect the vanishing locus of a degree-d polynomial in 2 variables to be a curve of degree d, and this is generically the case: but if the polynomial is, for instance, (x+y)^d, then the vanishing locus is (according to our definition) a curve of degree 1.  Problems of this kind will change degrees at worst by bounded multiplicative constants, so we will systematically ignore them; in any event, all proofs in the paper work when the better-behaved scheme-theoretic definitions of dimension and degree are used.



Given a projective (resp. affine) algebraic set V, we define its set of  F-points V(F) to be the set V(F) = V ∩^n(F) (resp. V(F) = V ∩^n(F)).

Two such tableaux are equivalent if they are the same up to a relabeling of the genes j.  An equivalence class T of these tableaux is a semistandard genomic tableau if:


  * The tableau T_ss obtained by forgetting the gene subscripts is semistandard and in canonical form.

  * Each gene j consists only of letters i_j and i'_j for some i, and its letters are consecutive in standardization order.

  * No two squares of the same gene are horizontally or vertically adjacent.

The K-theoretic content of T is (c_1, …, c_r) where c_i is the number of genes in the i-th family. Finally, T is ballot if it is semistandard and has the following property:

  * Within each gene family, the genes form a Pieri strip.

For each vertex j of  create s_j new indistinguishable vertices and
connect them to j with new edges directed towards j.

Step 2: For each vertex j of  create m+s_j- div(j) new

Then :={C_n,x|n∈_2^s-1,x∈_r} is a cycle decomposition of (2,r,s) into cycles of length four called the natural cycle decomposition of (2,r,s).

The graph ((2,r,s),) is simply denoted by ((2,r,s)).

A k-tuple of Riordan paths of length r is a vacillating tableau of length r if it meets the following conditions:

Q_132^(0,ℓ,0,0)|_t^nx^k is equal to the number of
  132-avoiding permutations in _n such that the packed
  of their suffix of length n + 1 -ℓ begins with value k+1.


Another interpretation of Proposition <ref> consists in noticing
that if a value σ_i has a greater value on its left, the first
value σ_1 of the permutation is also greater than
σ_i. By recurrence, a value σ_i having ℓ greater
values on their left is in fact smaller than the first ℓ values of
σ. This is due to the fact that if
σ_ℓ < σ_ℓ+1, then σ_ℓ+1 =
σ_ℓ+1 (132 avoidance implies that the remaining greater
values must be ordered) otherwise σ_ℓ > σ_ℓ+1
and a value seeing σ_ℓ+1 greater on its left sees also
σ_ℓ and by induction all previous values. Now, as having
ℓ greater values on the left is equivalent to be smaller than 
σ_ℓ, this can be checked using the Proposition <ref>
on the suffix of length n+1-ℓ that we pack by commodity
allowing us to keep 132-permutations (on smaller length when ℓ⩾ 2).

If G[X] is a chain of sausages of order at least 3 and x,x' ∈ X are adjacent, then the operation of identifying x and x' to a new vertex is called a sausage shortening .  If G' is obtained from G by repeatedly performing sausage shortenings until this operation is no longer possible, we call G' a sausage reduction of G.  We say that G is sausage reduced if it has no sausage of order at least 3 (so no sausage shortening is possible).",sausage shortening;sausage reduction;sausage reduced

Then the probability there is a perfect matching in G' is asymptotically equal to

Define μ = ∑_x a_x λ_x, and for each i ∈ [n] define μ_i  = ∑_j a_i,jλ_i,j.

Suppose that there is a complex bad event ℬ defined by 
    ℬ≡∑_x a_k [X_i = j] ≥ t

where we use the Iverson notation for whether variable i takes on value j, where t ≥μ.  Let d be any non-negative integer. Then, recalling Definition <ref>, there is a fractional hitting-set Q with the property

  - drop a perpendicular from p_1 to every arc  γ_n   for n∈ and denote by q_n the foot of the perpendicular;

  - let l_n be the (signed) hyperbolic distance from q_n to the horocycle h_1 centred at p_1 (in other words, l_n is the hyperbolic length of the portion of the perpendicular lying outside of the horocycle h_1);

  - w_n=exp(l_n)  will be called the width of a finite fan with n-1 triangles;

  - the width w_ of an infinite fan  (resp. ) is defined by the (finite or infinite) limit of w_n as n→∞ (see Lemma <ref> for the proof of the existence of the limit).
